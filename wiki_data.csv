B. Lippincott & Co.Publication placeUnited StatesPages281To Kill a Mockingbirdis a 1960Southern Gothicnovelby American authorHarper Lee.[1]It became instantly successful after its release; in the United States, it is widely read in high schools and middle schools.[2]To Kill a Mockingbirdwon thePulitzer Prizea year after its release, and it has become a classic of modernAmerican literature.[3]The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown ofMonroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was ten.[4]Despite dealing with the serious issues ofrapeandracial inequality, the novel is renowned for its warmth and humor.Atticus Finch, the narrator's father, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. The historianJoseph Crespinoexplains, ""In the twentieth century,To Kill a Mockingbirdis probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.""[5]As aSouthern Gothicnovel andBildungsroman, the primary themes ofTo Kill a Mockingbirdinvolve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence.  Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in theDeep South.  Lessons from the book emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice.[6]Despite its themes,To Kill a Mockingbirdhas been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, oftenchallengedfor its use of racialepithets.  In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of theBibleas one ""every adult should read before they die"".[7]Reaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions ofTo Kill a Mockingbirdby several authors and public figures, calls the book ""an astonishing phenomenon"".[8]It was adapted intoan Academy Award-winning filmin 1962 by directorRobert Mulligan, with a screenplay byHorton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown.To Kill a Mockingbirdwas Lee's only published book untilGo Set a Watchman, an earlier draft ofTo Kill a Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued to respond to her work's impact until her death in February 2016. She was very guarded about her personal life, and gave her last interview to a journalist in 1964.[9]Biographical background and publicationBorn in 1926,Harper Leegrew up in the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, where she became a close friend of soon-to-be-famous writerTruman Capote. She attendedHuntingdon CollegeinMontgomery(1944–45), and then studied law at theUniversity of Alabama(1945–49). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines:Huntressat Huntingdon and the humor magazineRammer Jammerat the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time.[10]In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk forBritish Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to aliterary agentrecommended by Capote. An editor atJ. B. Lippincott, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing.[11]Donations from friends allowed her to write uninterrupted for a year.[12]After finishing the first draft and returning it to Lippincott, the manuscript, at that point titled ""Go Set a Watchman"",[13]fell into the hands of Therese von Hohoff Torrey, known professionally asTay Hohoff. Hohoff was impressed: ""[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line,"" she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott,[13]but as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, ""more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel."" During the following two and a half years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form.[13]After the ""Watchman"" title was rejected, it was re-titledAtticusbut Lee renamed itTo Kill a Mockingbirdto reflect that the story went beyond a character portrait. The book was published on July 11, 1960.[14]The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies.[15]In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said,I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.' ... I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected.[16]Instead of a ""quick and merciful death"",Reader's Digest Condensed Bookschose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately.[17]Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.[18]Plot summarySee also:List ofTo Kill a MockingbirdcharactersThe story, told by Jean Louise Finch, takes place during three years (1933–35) of theGreat Depressionin the fictional town of Maycomb,Alabama, theseatof MaycombCounty. Nicknamed Scout, the narrator, who is six years old at the beginning of the book, lives with her older brother Jeremy, nicknamed Jem, and their widowed fatherAtticus, a middle-agedlawyer. They also have a black cook, Calpurnia, who has been with the family for many years and helps Atticus raise the two children.Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Charles Baker Harris, nicknamed Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified, yet fascinated, by their neighbor, thereclusiveArthur ""Boo"" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and many of them have not seen him for many years. The children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.Judge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has beenaccused of rapinga young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus's actions, calling him a ""nigger-lover"". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. One night, Atticus faces a group of men intent onlynchingTom. Scout, Jem, and Dill unexpectedly show up, and Scout inadvertently breaks themob mentalityby recognizing and talking to a classmate's father, causing the would-be lynchers to disperse.Atticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is available on the main floor, but the Rev. Sykes, the pastor of Calpurnia's church, invites Jem, Scout and Dill to watch from thecolored balcony. Atticus establishes that Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying. It is revealed that Mayella madesexual advancestoward Tom, resulting in her being beaten by her father. The townspeople refer to the Ewells as ""white trash"" who are not to be trusted, but the jury convicts Tom regardless. Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken. Atticus is hopeful that he can get the verdict overturned, but Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.Despite Tom's conviction, Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial. Atticus explains that he destroyed Ewell's last shred of credibility. Ewell vows revenge, spitting in Atticus' face, trying to break into the judge's house andmenacingTom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks Jem and Scout while they are walking home on a dark night after a school pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm and is knocked unconscious in the struggle, but amid the confusion, someone comes to the children's rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley.Sheriff Tate arrives and discovers Ewell dead from a knife wound. Atticus believes that Jem was responsible, but Tate is certain it was Boo. The sheriff tells Atticus that, to protect Boo's privacy, he will report that Ewell simply fell on his own knife during the attack. Boo asks Scout to walk him home. After she says goodbye to him at his front door, he disappears, never to be seen again by Scout. While standing on the Radleyporch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective.Autobiographical elementsLee said thatTo Kill a Mockingbirdis not anautobiography, but rather an example of how an author ""should write about what he knows and write truthfully"".[19]Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout.Amasa Coleman Lee, Lee's father, was an attorney similar to Atticus Finch. In 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated,[20]he never took another criminal case. Lee's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years.[21]Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee's mother was prone to anervous conditionthat rendered her mentally and emotionally absent.[22]Lee modeled the character of Dill onTruman Capote, her childhood friend known then as Truman Persons.[23][24]Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer, Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City.[25]Like Dill, Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories. Both Lee and Capote loved to read, and were atypical children in some ways: Lee was a scrappytomboywho was quick to fight, and Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp. She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an oldUnderwoodtypewriter that Lee's father gave them. They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers; Capote called the two of them ""apart people"".[26]In 1960, Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote'snonfiction novelIn Cold Blood.[27]Down the street from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24 years out of shame. He was hidden until virtually forgotten; he died in 1952.[28]The origin of Tom Robinson is less clear, although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models. When Lee was 10 years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father's newspaper, which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there oftuberculosisin 1937.[29]Scholars believe that Robinson's difficulties reflect the notorious case of theScottsboro Boys,[30][31]in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. However, in 2005, Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served ""the same purpose"" to display Southernprejudices.[32]Emmett Till, a black teenager who was murdered for allegedly flirting with a white woman inMississippiin 1955, and whose death is credited as a catalyst for theCivil Rights Movement, is also considered a model for Tom.[33]StyleThe narrative is very tough, because [Lee] has to both be a kid on the street and aware of the mad dogs and the spooky houses and have this beautiful vision of how justice works and all the creaking mechanisms of the courthouse. Part of the beauty is that she... trusts the visual to lead her, and the sensory.—Allan Gurganus[34]The strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee's talent for narration, which in an early review inTimewas called ""tactile brilliance"".[35]Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, ""Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition.""[36]Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives.[37]This narrative method allows Lee to tell a ""delightfully deceptive"" story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition.[38]However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding.[39]Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary criticGranville Hicksexpressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.[40][41]Writing about Lee's style and use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: ""Laughter ... [exposes] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly ... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at.""[42]Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her ""hysterically funny"".[43]To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee usesparody,satire, andironyeffectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times.[44]Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further.[45]Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society.  Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society—by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.[42]Critics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot.[46]When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks aSunday schoolclassmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game ofShadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's.[47]Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.[48]GenresScholars have characterizedTo Kill a Mockingbirdas both aSouthern Gothicand aBildungsroman. The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson, contribute to the aura of theGothicin the novel.[49][50]Lee used the term ""Gothic"" to describe thearchitectureof Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley.[51]Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel toCatcher in the RyeandAdventures of Huckleberry Finn.[52]Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is socialostracism.[53]However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is, in fact, human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism,incest, rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small townrealisticallyrather than melodramatically. She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society.[50]As children coming of age, Scout and Jem face hard realities and learn from them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day after the trial, ""It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon ... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like"".[54]This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, ""To Kill a Mockingbirdcan be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be.""[55]ThemesDespite the novel's immense popularity upon publication, it has not received the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics. Don Noble, the editor of a book of essays about the novel, estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one. Christopher Metress writes that the book is ""an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined"".[56]Noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best-seller (""If that many people like it, it can't be any good."") and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation.[57]Harper Lee had remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid-1960s. However, she gave some insight into her themes when, in a rare letter to the editor, she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused:Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence thatTo Kill a Mockingbirdspells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners.[58]Southern life and racial injusticeIn the 33 years since its publication, [To Kill a Mockingbird] has never been the focus of a dissertation, and it has been the subject of only six literary studies, several of them no more than a couple of pages long.—Claudia Johnson inTo Kill a Mockingbird: Threatening Boundaries, 1994[59]When the book was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them.[60]The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood.  Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors.  One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romanticregionalism.[61]This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southerncaste systemto explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages togenealogy(families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks),[62]and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb.  This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of ""fine folks"" being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have.The Southitself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.[61]The second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed ""the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro"".[40]In the years following its release, many reviewers consideredTo Kill a Mockingbirda novel primarily concerned withrace relations.[63]Claudia Durst Johnsonconsiders it ""reasonable to believe"" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama:Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked theMontgomery bus boycott, and the 1956 riots at theUniversity of AlabamaafterAutherine Lucyand Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).[64]In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: ""To Kill a Mockingbirdwas written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.""[65]Scholar Patrick Chura, who suggestsEmmett Tillwas a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the ""mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood"".[33]Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice inTo Kill a Mockingbirdwas physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways.[33]Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as ""stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him"".[66]Although Tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, being shot seventeen times.The theme of racial injustice appearssymbolicallyin the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot arabiddog, even though it is not his job to do so.[67]Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog,[68]must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlikeimageryfrom the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, ""[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson ... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger.""[68]ClassOne of the amazing things about the writing inTo Kill a Mockingbirdis the economy with which Harper Lee delineates not only race—white and black within a small community—but class. I meandifferent kindsof black people and white people both, from poor white trash to the upper crust—the whole social fabric.—Lee Smith[69]In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was ""to be ... theJane Austenof South Alabama.""[50]Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so.[70]Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia.[71]One writer notes that Scout, ""in Austenian fashion"", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify.[72]Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: ""affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status"".[50]Scholars argue that Lee's approach to class and race was more complex ""than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash' ... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation.""[65]Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense ofnostalgia.  Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservativeantebellumMrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community.  The children internalize Atticus' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person's skin, gaining a greater understanding of people's motives and behavior.[65]Courage and compassionThe novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms ofcourage.[73][74]Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him.  Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem one of the most significant lessons of courage.[75]In a statement that bothforeshadowsAtticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of amorphineaddiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is ""when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what"".[76]External videosAfter Wordsinterview with Shields onMockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee, July 11, 2015,C-SPANCharles J. Shields, who wrote the first book-length biography of Harper Lee, offers the reason for the novel's enduring popularity and impact is that ""its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal"".[77]Atticus' lesson to Scout that ""you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view—until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it"" exemplifies his compassion.[74][78]She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony.  When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley.  Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective.  One writer remarks, ""... [w]hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [of] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings.""[74]Gender rolesJust as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development.  Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider.[55]Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective.  Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him.  The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view.[72]For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress andcamisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson.  By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, ""Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.""[72]Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers.[79]Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter,[80]and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house to the extent that Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: ""It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.""[79]Laws, written and unwrittenAllusionsto legal issues inTo Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, have drawn the attention of legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that ""a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals"".[81]The opening quote by the 19th-century essayistCharles Lambreads: ""Lawyers, I suppose, were children once."" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm, and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him.[64]Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's ""fanatical"" attempts to place her in them made her feel ""a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]"".[82]Johnson states, ""[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds.""[64]Loss of innocenceLee used the mockingbird to symbolize innocence in the novel.Songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel. Theirfamily nameFinchis also Lee's mother'smaiden name. The titularmockingbirdis a key motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack to teach them to shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can ""shoot all the bluejays they want"", they must remember that ""it's a sin to kill a mockingbird"".[83]Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, ""They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.""[83]Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, ""'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless—like Tom Robinson.""[62]Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.[36][84][85]Tom Robinson is the chief example, among several in the novel, of innocents being carelessly or deliberately destroyed.  However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: ""Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished.""[86]The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson,[33]states about a character who was misunderstood, ""when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things ... Atticus, he was real nice,"" to which he responds, ""Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.""[87]The novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character has to face, or even suffer defeat, the book takes on elements of a classicaltragedy.[36]In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony. Scout's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and ""reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races"" while giving the ""appearance of gentility, piety, and morality"".[72]Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom's case, he is last to leave the courtroom, except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony, who rise silently as he walks underneath them, to honor his efforts.[88]ReceptionDespite her editors' warnings that the book might not sell well, it quickly became a sensation, bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles, in her hometown of Monroeville, and throughout Alabama.[89]The book went through numerous subsequent printings and became widely available through its inclusion in theBook of the Month Cluband editions released byReader's Digest Condensed Books.[90]Initial reactions to the novel were varied.The New Yorkerdeclared Lee ""a skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenuous writer"",[91]andThe Atlantic Monthly's reviewer rated the book ""pleasant, undemanding reading"", but found the narrative voice—""a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult""—to be implausible.[39]Timemagazine's 1960 review of the book states that it ""teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful truths about little girls and about Southern life"" and calls Scout Finch ""the most appealing child sinceCarson McCullers' Frankie got left behind at thewedding"".[35]TheChicago Sunday Tribunenoted the even-handed approach to the narration of the novel's events, writing: ""This is in no way a sociological novel. It underlines no cause ...To Kill a Mockingbirdis a novel of strong contemporary national significance.""[92]Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some lamented the use of poor white Southerners, and one-dimensional black victims,[93]andGranville Hickslabeled the book ""melodramaticand contrived"".[41]When the book was first released, Southern writerFlannery O'Connorcommented, ""I think for a child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is.""[56]Carson McCullers apparently agreed with theTimemagazine review, writing to a cousin: ""Well, honey, one thing we know is that she's been poaching on my literary preserves.""[94]One year after its publicationTo Kill a Mockingbirdhad been translated into ten languages. In the years since, it has sold more than 30 million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages.[95]The novel has never been out of print in hardcover or paperback, and has become part of the standard literature curriculum. A 2008 survey of secondary books read by students between grades 9–12 in the U.S. indicates the novel is the most widely read book in these grades.[96]A 1991 survey by the Book of the Month Club and theLibrary of CongressCenter for the Book found thatTo Kill a Mockingbirdwas fourth in a list of books that are ""most often cited as making a difference"".[97][note 1]It is considered by some to be the ""Great American Novel"".[98]The 50th anniversary of the novel's release was met with celebrations and reflections on its impact.[99]Eric Zornof theChicago Tribunepraises Lee's ""rich use of language"" but writes that the central lesson is that ""courage isn't always flashy, isn't always enough, but is always in style"".[100]Jane Sullivan in theSydney Morning Heraldagrees, stating that the book ""still rouses fresh and horrified indignation"" as it examines morality, a topic that has recently become unfashionable.[101]Chimamanda Ngozi Adichiewriting inThe Guardianstates that Lee, rare among American novelists, writes with ""a fiercely progressive ink, in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question"", comparing her toWilliam Faulkner, who wrote about racism as an inevitability.[102]Literary critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland'sThe Heraldnotes the connections between Lee andJane Austen, stating the book's central theme, that ""one's moral convictions are worth fighting for, even at the risk of being reviled"" is eloquently discussed.[103]Native Alabamian sports writerAllen Barrasharply criticized Lee and the novel inThe Wall Street Journalcalling Atticus a ""repository of cracker-barrel epigrams"" and the novel represents a ""sugar-coated myth"" of Alabama history. Barra writes, ""It's time to stop pretending thatTo Kill a Mockingbirdis some kind of timeless classic that ranks with the great works of American literature. Its bloodless liberal humanism is sadly dated"".[104]Thomas MalloninThe New Yorkercriticizes Atticus' stiff and self-righteous demeanor, and calls Scout ""a kind of highly constructed doll"" whose speech and actions are improbable. Although acknowledging that the novel works, Mallon blasts Lee's ""wildly unstable"" narrative voice for developing a story about a content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama, following with his observation that ""the book has begun to cherish its own goodness"" by the time the case is over.[105][note 2]Defending the book, Akin Ajayi writes that justice ""is often complicated, but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all."" Ajayi states that the book forces readers to question issues about race, class, and society, but that it was not written to resolve them.[106]External videosInterview with Mary McDonagh Murphy onScout, Atticus & Boo, June 26, 2010,C-SPANMany writers compare their perceptions ofTo Kill a Mockingbirdas adults with when they first read it as children. Mary McDonagh Murphy interviewed celebrities includingOprah Winfrey,Rosanne Cash,Tom Brokaw, and Harper's sister Alice Lee, who read the novel and compiled their impressions of it as children and adults into a book titledScout, Atticus, and Boo.[107]The New York Times announcedTo Kill a Mockingbirdas the best book of the past 125 years on December 28, 2021.[108]Atticus Finch and the legal professionMain article:Atticus FinchI promised myself that when I grew up and I was a man, I would try to do things just as good and noble as what Atticus had done for Tom Robinson.—Scott Turow[109]One of the most significant impactsTo Kill a Mockingbirdhas had is Atticus Finch's model of integrity for the legal profession. As scholar Alice Petry explains, ""Atticus has become something of a folk hero in legal circles and is treated almost as if he were an actual person.""[110]Morris Deesof theSouthern Poverty Law Centercites Atticus Finch as the reason he became a lawyer, andRichard Matsch, the federal judge who presided over theTimothy McVeightrial, counts Atticus as a major judicial influence.[111]One law professor at theUniversity of Notre Damestated that the most influential textbook he taught from wasTo Kill a Mockingbird, and an article in theMichigan Law Reviewclaims, ""No real-life lawyer has done more for the self-image or public perception of the legal profession,"" before questioning whether ""Atticus Finch is a paragon of honor or an especially slick hired gun"".[112]In 1992, an Alabama editorial called for the death of Atticus, saying that as liberal as Atticus was, he still worked within a system of institutionalizedracismandsexismand should not be revered. The editorial sparked a flurry of responses from attorneys who entered the profession because of him and esteemed him as a hero.[113]Critics of Atticus maintain he is morally ambiguous and does not use his legal skills to challenge the racist status quo in Maycomb.[56]However, in 1997, theAlabama State Barerected a monument to Atticus in Monroeville, marking his existence as the ""first commemorative milestone in the state's judicial history"".[114]In 2008, Lee herself received an honorary special membership to the Alabama State Bar for creating Atticus who ""has become the personification of the exemplary lawyer in serving the legal needs of the poor"".[115]Social commentary and challengesTo Kill a Mockingbirdhas been a source of significant controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963. The book's racial slurs, profanity, and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States. TheAmerican Library Associationreported thatTo Kill a Mockingbirdwas number 21 of the 100 most frequentlychallengedbooks of 2000–2009.[116]Following parental complaints about the racist language it contains, the novel was removed from classrooms in Virginia in 2016[117][118]andBiloxi, Mississippi, where it was described as making people ""uncomfortable"",[119]in 2017.[120][121]In the Mississippi case, the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent.[122]Such decisions have been criticised: theAmerican Civil Liberties Unionnoted the importance of engaging with the novel's themes in places where racial injustice persists.[123]In 2021, a group of teachers inMukilteo, Washingtonproposed to take the book off the list of required reading for freshman and off the list of district-approved books to be studied and analyzed in classrooms, arguing that it ""centers on whiteness"". The school board approved the former but not the latter proposal.[124]Becky Little, ofThe History Channel, and representatives of theMark Twain Housenoted that the value of classics lies in their power to ""challenge the way we think about things""[125](Twain'sAdventures of Huckleberry Finnhas attracted similar controversy).[126]Arne Duncan, who served asSecretary of EducationunderPresident Obama, noted that removal of the book from reading lists was evidence of a nation with ""real problems"".[127]In 1966, a parent inHanover, Virginia, protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape.[128]Upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the book's appropriateness for the classroom, Harper Lee sent $10 toThe Richmond News Leadersuggesting it be used toward the enrollment of ""the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice"".[58]TheNational Education Associationin 1968 placed the novel second on a list of books receiving the most complaints from private organizations—afterLittle Black Sambo.[129]With a shift of attitudes about race in the 1970s,To Kill a Mockingbirdfaced challenges of a different sort: the treatment of racism in Maycomb was not condemned harshly enough. This has led to disparate perceptions that the novel has a generally positive impact on race relations for white readers, but a more ambiguous reception by black readers. In one high-profile case outside the U.S., school districts in the Canadian provinces ofNew BrunswickandNova Scotiaattempted to have the book removed from standard teaching curricula in the 1990s,[note 3]stating:The terminology in this novel subjects students to humiliating experiences that rob them of their self-respect and the respect of their peers. The word 'Nigger' is used 48 times [in] the novel ... We believe that the English Language Arts curriculum in Nova Scotia must enable all students to feel comfortable with ideas, feelings and experiences presented without fear of humiliation ...To Kill a Mockingbirdis clearly a book that no longer meets these goals and therefore must no longer be used for classroom instruction.[130]Furthermore, despite the novel's thematic focus on racial injustice, its black characters are not fully examined.[80]In its use of racial epithets,stereotypeddepictions ofsuperstitiousblacks, and Calpurnia, who to some critics is an updated version of the ""contented slave"" motif and to others simply unexplored, the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters.[131][132]One writer asserts that the use of Scout's narration serves as a convenient mechanism for readers to be innocent and detached from the racial conflict. Scout's voice ""functions as the not-me which allows the rest of us—black and white, male and female—to find our relative position in society"".[80]A teaching guide for the novel published byThe English Journalcautions, ""what seems wonderful or powerful to one group of students may seem degrading to another"".[133]A Canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students, but that black students found it ""demoralizing"".[134]With racism told from a white perspective with a focus on white courage and morality, some have labeled the novel as having a ""white savior complex"",[135]a criticism also leveled at the film adaptation with itswhite savior narrative.[136]Another criticism, articulated byMichael Lind, is that the novel indulges inclassiststereotyping anddemonizationof poor rural ""white trash"".[137]The novel is cited as a factor in the success of thecivil rights movementin the 1960s, in that it ""arrived at the right moment to help the South and the nation grapple with the racial tensions (of) the accelerating civil rights movement"".[138]Its publication is so closely associated with the Civil Rights Movement that many studies of the book and biographies of Harper Lee include descriptions of important moments in the movement, despite the fact that she had no direct involvement in any of them.[139][140][141]Civil Rights leaderAndrew Youngcomments that part of the book's effectiveness is that it ""inspires hope in the midst of chaos and confusion"" and by using racial epithets portrays the reality of the times in which it was set. Young views the novel as ""an act of humanity"" in showing the possibility of people rising above their prejudices.[142]Alabama authorMark Childresscompares it to the impact ofUncle Tom's Cabin, a book that is popularly implicated in starting the U.S. Civil War. Childress states the novelgives white Southerners a way to understand the racism that they've been brought up with and to find another way. And most white people in the South were good people. Most white people in the South were not throwing bombs and causing havoc ... I think the book really helped them come to understand what was wrong with the system in the way that any number of treatises could never do, because it was popular art, because it was told from a child's point of view.[143]Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of theBirmingham campaign, asserts thatTo Kill a Mockingbirdcondemns racism instead of racists, and states that every child in the South has moments of racialcognitive dissonancewhen they are faced with the harsh reality of inequality. This feeling causes them to question the beliefs with which they have been raised, which for many children is what the novel does. McWhorter writes of Lee, ""for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual—by its very existence an act of protest.""[144][note 4]AuthorJames McBridecalls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave:I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism ... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed, but in many ways I feel ... the moral bar's been lowered. And that's really distressing. We need a thousand Atticus Finches.McBride also defends the book's sentimentality, and the way Lee approaches the story with ""honesty and integrity"".[145]HonorsHarper Leeand PresidentGeorge W. Bushat the November 5, 2007, ceremony awarding Lee thePresidential Medal of FreedomforTo Kill a MockingbirdDuring the years immediately following the novel's publication, Harper Lee enjoyed the attention its popularity garnered her, granting interviews, visiting schools, and attending events honoring the book. In 1961, whenTo Kill a Mockingbirdwas in its 41st week on the bestseller list, it was awarded thePulitzer Prize, stunning Lee.[146]It also won the Brotherhood Award of theNational Conference of Christians and Jewsin the same year, and the Paperback of the Year award fromBestsellersmagazine in 1962.[90][147]Starting in 1964, Lee began to turn down interviews, complaining that the questions were monotonous, and grew concerned that the attention she received bordered on the kind of publicity celebrities sought.[148]Since then, she declined to talk with reporters about the book. She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction, writing in 1995: ""Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity. The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come.Mockingbirdstill says what it has to say; it has managed to survive the years without preamble.""[149]In 2001, Lee was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor.[150]In the same year, Chicago mayorRichard M. Daleyinitiated a reading program throughout the city's libraries, and chose his favorite book,To Kill a Mockingbird, as the first title of theOne City, One Bookprogram. Lee declared that ""there is no greater honor the novel could receive"".[151]By 2004, the novel had been chosen by 25 communities for variations of the citywide reading program, more than any other novel.[152]David Kipen of the National Endowment of the Arts, who supervisedThe Big Read, states ""people just seem to connect with it. It dredges up things in their own lives, their interactions across racial lines, legal encounters, and childhood. It's just this skeleton key to so many different parts of people's lives, and they cherish it.""[153]In 2006, Lee was awarded anhonorary doctoratefrom theUniversity of Notre Dame. During the ceremony, the students and audience gave Lee a standing ovation, and the entire graduating class held up copies ofTo Kill a Mockingbirdto honor her.[154][note 5]Lee was awarded thePresidential Medal of Freedomon November 5, 2007, by PresidentGeorge W. Bush. In his remarks, Bush stated, ""One reasonTo Kill a Mockingbirdsucceeded is the wise and kind heart of the author, which comes through on every page ...To Kill a Mockingbirdhas influenced the character of our country for the better. It's been a gift to the entire world. As a model of good writing and humane sensibility, this book will be read and studied forever.""[155]After remaining at number one throughout the entire five-month-long voting period in 2018, the American public, viaPBS'sThe Great American Read, choseTo Kill A Mockingbirdas America's Favorite Book.[156]In 2003, the novel was listed at No. 6 on theBBC'sThe Big Readafter a year-long survey of the British public, the highest ranking non-British book on the list.[157]On November 5, 2019,BBC NewslistedTo Kill a Mockingbirdon its list of the100 most influential novels.[158]In 2020, the novel was number five on the list of ""Top Check Outs OF ALL TIME"" by theNew York Public Library.[159]Go Set a WatchmanMain article:Go Set a WatchmanAn earlier draft ofTo Kill a Mockingbird, titledGo Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015.[160][161][162]This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted inTo Kill a Mockingbirdbut is not a continuation of the narrative.[13][160]This earlier version of the story follows an adultScout Finchwho travels fromNew York Cityto visit her father,Atticus Finch, inMaycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. TheWatchmanmanuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it, but this claim has been widely disputed.[160][161][162]Watchmancontains early versions of many of the characters fromTo Kill a Mockingbird.[163]According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg,Mockingbirdwas originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: ""They discussed publishingMockingbirdfirst,Watchmanlast, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.""[164]This assertion has been discredited, however,[165]by rare-books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft ofTo Kill a Mockingbird.[165]Nurnberg's statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of howWatchmanwas seen as just the first draft ofMockingbird.[13]Instances where many passages overlap between the two books, in some case word for word, also refute this assertion.[166]Both books were also investigated with the help of forensic linguistics and their comparative study confirmed that Harper Lee was their sole author.[167]Other media1962 filmMain article:To Kill a Mockingbird(film)Film producerAlan J. Pakulawith Lee; Lee spent three weeks watching the filming, then ""took off when she realized everything would be fine without her""[150]The book was made into the well-received 1962 filmwith the same title, starringGregory Peckas Atticus Finch. The film's producer,Alan J. Pakula, rememberedUniversal Picturesexecutives questioning him about a potential script: ""They said, 'What story do you plan to tell for the film?' I said, 'Have you read the book?' They said, 'Yes.' I said, 'That's the story.'""[168]The movie was a hit at the box office, quickly grossing more than $20 million from a $2-million budget. It won threeOscars:Best Actorfor Gregory Peck,Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Black-and-White, andBest Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Mediumfor Horton Foote. It was nominated for five more Oscars includingBest Picture,Best DirectorandBest Actress in a Supporting RoleforMary Badham, the actress who played Scout.[169]At the time, she was the youngest actress nominated in the category.[170]Lee was pleased with the film, ""In that film the man and the part met ... I've had many, many offers to turn it into musicals, into TV or stage plays, but I've always refused. That film was a work of art"".[171]Peck met Lee's father, the model for Atticus, before the filming. Lee's father died before the film's release. Lee was so impressed with Peck's performance that she gave him her father'spocket watch, which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor.[172]Years later, he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage inLondon Heathrow Airport. When Peck eventually did tell Lee, she told him, ""Well, it's only a watch"". He said, ""Harper—she feels deeply, but she's not a sentimental person about things"".[173]Lee and Peck shared a friendship long after the movie was made. Peck's grandson was named ""Harper"" in her honor.[174]In May 2005, Lee made an uncharacteristic appearance at theLos Angeles Public Libraryat the request of Peck's widow Veronique, who said of Lee:She's like a national treasure. She's someone who has made a difference ... with this book. The book is still as strong as it ever was, and so is the film. All the kids in the United States read this book and see the film in the seventh and eighth grades and write papers and essays. My husband used to get thousands and thousands of letters from teachers who would send them to him.[16]PlaysThe book was first adapted as a play by Christopher Sergel. This adaptation debuted in 1990 in Monroeville, a town that labels itself ""The Literary Capital of Alabama"". The play runs every May on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast. White male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury. During the courtroom scene, the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated.[175]AuthorAlbert Murraysaid of the relationship of the town to the novel (and the annual performance): ""It becomes part of the town ritual, like the religious underpinning ofMardi Gras. With the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse, it's part of a central, civic education—what Monroeville aspires to be.""[176]Sergel's play toured in the UK starting at theWest Yorkshire PlayhouseinLeedsin 2006,[177]and again in 2011 starting at theYork Theatre Royal,[178]both productions featuringDuncan Prestonas Atticus Finch. The play also opened the 2013 season atRegent's Park Open Air Theatrein London where it played to full houses and starredRobert Sean Leonardas Atticus Finch, his first London appearance in 22 years. The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season, prior to a UK tour.[179][180]According to aNational Geographicarticle, the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture; however, Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances, because ""she abhors anything that trades on the book's fame"".[181]To underscore this sentiment, Lee demanded that a book of recipes namedCalpurnia's Cookbooknot be published and sold out of the Monroe County Heritage Museum.[182]David Lister inThe Independentstates that Lee's refusal to speak to reporters made them desire to interview her all the more, and her silence ""makesBob Dylanlook like a media tart"".[183]Despite her discouragement, a rising number of tourists made Monroeville their destination, hoping to see Lee's inspiration for the book, or Lee herself. Local residents call them ""Mockingbird groupies"", and although Lee was not reclusive, she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic ""Hell, no!""[184]In 2018, anew adaptationwas written byAaron Sorkin, debuting onBroadway.[185]The Broadway production was nominated for nineTony Awards, winning one.[186]Graphic novelIn October 2018, Fred Fordham adapted and illustrated the story as a graphic novel. Some of the longer descriptive and commentary passages have been left out - ""the bits that children tend to skip anyway"" asC. J. Lyonssays in her review of the graphic novel in the New York Journal of Books[187]), who goes on to say ""the heart of Lee's fictional 1933 Maycomb is faithfully recreated via the art and dialogue"".[187]TelevisionIna 2018 episodeofThe Simpsons, Lisa sees her dad asAtticus Finch.See alsoSouthern United States literatureAlabama literatureTimeline of the civil rights movementTo Kill a Mockingbirdin popular cultureNotes^To Kill a Mockingbirdhas appeared on numerous other lists that describe its impact.

It also popularised the term ""Orwellian"" as an adjective, with many terms used in the novel entering common usage, including ""Big Brother"", ""doublethink"", ""Thought Police"", ""thoughtcrime"", ""Newspeak"" and the expression that ""2 + 2 = 5"". Parallels have been drawn between the novel's subject-matter andreal lifeinstances of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and violations offreedom of expression, among other themes.[7][8][9]Orwell described his book as a ""satire"",[10]and a display of the ""perversions to which a centralised economy is liable"", while also stating he believed ""that something resembling it could arrive"".[10]Timemagazine included it on its list of the 100 best English-language novels published from 1923 to 2005,[11]and it was placed on theModern Library's 100 Best Novelslist, reaching number 13 on the editors' list and number 6 on the readers' list.[12]In 2003 it was listed at number eight onThe Big Readsurvey by theBBC.[13]It has been adapted across media since its publication, most notably as a film,released in 1984, starringJohn Hurt,Suzanna HamiltonandRichard Burton.Writing and publication[edit]Idea[edit]The Orwell Archive atUniversity College Londoncontains undated notes about ideas that evolved intoNineteen Eighty-Four. The notebooks have been deemed ""unlikely to have been completed later than January 1944"", and ""there is a strong suspicion that some of the material in them dates back to the early part of the war"".[14]In one letter from 1948 Orwell claims to have ""first thought of [the book] in 1943"", while in another he says he thought of it in 1944 and cites theTehran Conferencein 1943 as inspiration: ""What it is really meant to do is to discuss the implications of dividing the world up into 'Zones of Influence' (I thought of it in 1944 as a result of the Tehran Conference), and in addition to indicate by parodying them the intellectual implications of totalitarianism"".[14]Orwell had toured Austria in May 1945 and observed manoeuvring he thought would probably lead to separate Soviet and Allied Zones of Occupation.[15][16]In January 1944 the Russian literary historianGleb Struveintroduced Orwell toYevgeny Zamyatin's 1924 dystopian novel,We. In his response Orwell expressed an interest in the genre, and informed Struve that he had begun writing ideas for one of his own, ""that may get written sooner or later"".[17][18]In 1946 Orwell wrote about the 1931 dystopian novelBrave New WorldbyAldous Huxleyin his article ""Freedom and Happiness"" for theTribune, and noted similarities toWe.[17]By this time Orwell had scored a critical and commercial hit with his 1945 political satire,Animal Farm, which raised his profile. For a follow-up he decided to produce a dystopian work of his own.[19][20]Writing[edit]In a June 1944 meeting withFredric Warburg, co-founder of his British publisherSecker & Warburg, shortly before the release ofAnimal Farm, Orwell announced that he had written the first 12 pages of his new novel. As he could then only earn a living from journalism, he predicted the book would not see a release before 1947.[18]Progress was slow; by the end of September 1945 Orwell had written some 50 pages.[21]Orwell became disenchanted with the restrictions and pressures involved with journalism and grew to detest city life in London.[22]He suffered frombronchiectasisand a lesion in one lung; the harsh winter worsened his health.[23]The novel was completed atBarnhill, Jura.In May 1946 Orwell arrived on theScottish islandofJura.[20]He had wanted to retreat to aHebrideanisland for several years;David Astorrecommended he should stay atBarnhill, a remote farmhouse on the island that his family owned,[24]with no electricity or hot water. Here Orwell intermittently drafted and finishedNineteen Eighty-Four.[20]His first stay lasted till October 1946, and during it he made little progress on the few already completed pages, and for a period of three months he did not work on it at all.[25]After spending the winter in London, Orwell returned to Jura; in May 1947 he reported to Warburg that despite progress being slow and difficult, he was roughly a third of the way through.[26]He sent his ""ghastly mess"" of a first-draft manuscript to London, where Miranda Christen volunteered to type a clean version.[27]Orwell's health worsened further in September, and he was confined to his bed with inflammation of the lungs. He lost almost two stone (28 pounds or 12.7 kg) in weight and had recurring night sweats, but he decided not to see a doctor and continued writing.[28]On 7 November 1947 he completed the first draft in bed, and subsequently travelled toEast KilbridenearGlasgowfor medical treatment atHairmyres Hospital, where a specialist confirmed a chronic and infectious case oftuberculosis.[29][27]Orwell was discharged in the summer of 1948, after which he returned to Jura and produced a full second draft ofNineteen Eighty-Four, which he finished in November. He asked Warburg to have someone come to Barnhill and retype the manuscript, which was so untidy that the task was only considered possible if Orwell were present, as only he could understand it. The previous volunteer had left the country and no other could be found at short notice, so an impatient Orwell retyped it himself at a rate of roughly 4,000 words a day during bouts of fever and bloody coughing fits.[27]On 4 December 1948 Orwell sent the finished manuscript to Secker & Warburg and left Barnhill for good in January 1949. He recovered at a sanitarium in theCotswolds.[27]Title[edit]Shortly before completion of the second draft, Orwell vacillated between two titles:The Last Man in Europe, an early title, andNineteen Eighty-Four.[30]Warburg suggested the latter, which he took to be a more commercially viable choice.[31]There has been a theory – doubted by Dorian Lynskey (author ofa 2019 book aboutNineteen Eighty-Four) – that1984was chosen simply as an inversion of the year 1948, the year in which it was being completed. Lynskey says the idea was ""first suggested by Orwell's US publisher"", and it was also mentioned byChristopher Hitchensin his introduction to the 2003 edition ofAnimal Farm and 1984, which also notes that the date was meant to give ""an immediacy and urgency to the menace of totalitarian rule"".[32]However, Lynskey does not believe the inversion theory:This idea ... seems far too cute for such a serious book. ... Scholars have raised other possibilities. [His wife] Eileen wrote a poem for her old school's centenary called 'End of the Century: 1984.'G. K. Chesterton's 1904 political satireThe Napoleon of Notting Hill, which mocks the art of prophecy, opens in 1984. The year is also a significant date inThe Iron Heel. But all of these connections are exposed as no more than coincidences by the early drafts of the novel ... First he wrote 1980, then 1982, and only later 1984. The most fateful date in literature was a late amendment.[33]Publication[edit]A 1947 draftmanuscriptof the first page ofNineteen Eighty-Four, showing theeditorialdevelopmentIn the run up to publication Orwell called the novel ""abeastlybook"" and expressed some disappointment towards it, thinking it would have been improved had he not been so ill. This was typical of Orwell, who had talked down his other books shortly before their release.[33]Nevertheless, it was enthusiastically received by Secker & Warburg, who acted quickly; before Orwell had left Jura he rejected their proposed blurb that portrayed it as ""a thriller mixed up with a love story"".[33]He also refused a proposal from the American Book of the Month Club to release an edition without the appendix and chapter on Goldstein's book, a decision which Warburg claimed cut off about £40,000 in sales.[33][34]Nineteen Eighty-Fourwas published on 8 June 1949 in Britain;[33][35][36]Orwell predicted earnings of around £500. A first print of 25,575 copies was followed by a further 5,000 copies in March and August 1950.[37]It had the most immediate impact in the United States, following its release there on 13 June 1949 byHarcourt Brace, & Co.An initial print of 20,000 copies was quickly followed by another 10,000 on 1 July, and again on 7 September.[38]By 1970 over 8 million copies had been sold in the US, and in 1984 it topped the country's all-time best seller list.[39]In June 1952 Orwell's widow, Sonia Brownell, sold the sole remaining manuscript at a charity auction for £50.[40]The draft remains the only surviving literary manuscript from Orwell, and is held at theJohn Hay LibraryatBrown UniversityinProvidence, Rhode Island, US.[41][42]Variant English language editions[edit]In the original published UK and US editions of 1984 numerous small variations in the text exist, the US edition altering Orwell's agreed edit of the text as was typical of publishing practices of the time in regard to spelling and punctuation, as well as some small edits and phrasings. While Orwell rejected a proposed book club edition which would see substantial sections of the book removed, these minor changes passed somewhat under the radar. Other more significant revisions and variant texts also exist, however.In 1984 Peter Davison editedNineteen Eighty-Four: The Facsimile of the Extant Manuscript, published by Secker and Warburg in Britain and Harcourt-Brace-Jovanovich in America. This reproduced, page-for-page, Brownell's copy of the original manuscript infacsimiles, as well as a complete typeset versions of that text, complete with Orwell's holograph and typewritten pages, and handwritten amendments and corrections. The book had a preface by Daniel Segal. It has been reprinted in various international editions with translated introductions and notes, and reprinted in English in limited edition formats.In 1997 Davison produced a definitive text ofNineteen Eighty Fouras part of Secker's 20-volume definitive edition of theComplete Works of George Orwell. This edition removed errors and reversed editorial changes in the original editions made without Orwell's oversight, all based on detailed reference to Orwell's original manuscript and notes. This text has gone on to be reprinted in various subsequent paperback editions, including one with an introduction by the novelistThomas Pynchon, without obvious note that it is a revised text, and has been translated as an unexpurgated version of text.In 2021 Polygon publishedNineteen Eighty Four: The Jura Edition, with an introduction by Alex Massie.Plot[edit]As the narrative opens on ""April 4th, 1984"" (although even the protagonist, aware that the government is constantly revising accounts of past events, ""did not know with any certainty that this was 1984"") the world has been ravaged for decades by global war, civil conflict, and revolution. Airstrip One (formerly known asGreat Britain) is a province ofOceania, one of the threetotalitariansuper-statesthat rule the world. It is ruled by ""The Party"" under the ideology of ""Ingsoc"" (aNewspeakshortening of ""English Socialism"") and the mysterious leaderBig Brother, who has an intensecult of personality. The Party brutally purges out anyone who does not fully conform to their regime, using theThought Policeand constant surveillance throughtelescreens(two-way televisions),camerasandhidden microphones. Those who fall out of favour with the Party become ""unpersons"", disappearing withall evidence of their existence destroyed.In LondonWinston Smithis a member of the Outer Party, working at theMinistry of Truth, where herewrites historical recordsto conform to the state's ever-changing version of history. Winston revises past editions ofThe Times, while the original documents are destroyed after being dropped into ducts known asmemory holes, which lead to an immense furnace. He secretly opposes the Party's rule and dreams of rebellion, despite knowing that he is already a ""thought-criminal"" and is likely to be caught one day.While in aproleneighbourhood he meets Mr Charrington, the owner of anantiques shop, and buys a diary where he writes criticisms of the Party and Big Brother. To his dismay, when he visits a prole quarter he discovers they have no political consciousness. As he works in the Ministry of Truth, he observesJulia, a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry, whom Winston suspects of being a spy, and develops an intense hatred of her. He vaguely suspects thatO'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and a superior of his, is part of an enigmatic undergroundresistance movementknown as the Brotherhood, formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival,Emmanuel Goldstein.One day Julia discreetly hands Winston a love note, and the two begin a secret affair. Julia explains that she also loathes the Party, but Winston observes that she is politically apathetic and uninterested in overthrowing the regime. Initially meeting in the country, they later meet in a rented room above Mr Charrington's shop. During the affair, Winston remembers the disappearance of his family during the civil war of the 1950s and his tense relationship with his estranged wife Katharine. Weeks later, O'Brien invites Winston to his flat, where he introduces himself as a member of the Brotherhood and sends Winston a copy ofThe Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivismby Goldstein. Meanwhile, during the nation's Hate Week, Oceania's enemy suddenly changes fromEurasiatoEastasia, which goes mostly unnoticed. Winston is recalled to the Ministry to help make the necessary revisions to the records. Winston and Julia read parts of Goldstein's book, which explains how the Party maintains power, the true meanings of its slogans, and the concept ofperpetual war. It argues that the Party can be overthrown if proles rise up against it. However, Winston never gets the opportunity to read the chapter that explains why the Party took power and is motivated to maintain it.Winston and Julia are captured when Mr Charrington is revealed to be an undercover Thought Police agent, and they are separated and imprisoned at theMinistry of Love. O'Brien also reveals himself to be a member of the Thought Police and a member of afalse flagoperation which catches political dissidents of the Party. Over several months, Winston is starved and relentlessly tortured to bring his beliefs in line with the Party. O'Brien tells Winston that he will never know whether the Brotherhood actually exists and that Goldstein's book was written collaboratively by him and other Party members; furthermore, O'Brien reveals to Winston that the Party sees power not as a means but as an end, and the ultimate purpose of the Party is seeking power entirely for its own sake. For the final stage of re-education, O'Brien takes Winston toRoom 101, which contains each prisoner's worst fear. When confronted with rats, Winston denounces Julia and pledges allegiance to the Party.Winston is released into public life and continues to frequent the Chestnut Tree café. He encounters Julia, and both reveal that they have betrayed the other and are no longer in love. Back in the café, a news alert celebrates Oceania's supposed massive victory over Eurasian armies in Africa. Winston finally accepts that he loves Big Brother.Epilogue[edit]The novel includes an epilogue, an appendix of around 1,000 words, titledPrinciples of Newspeak, and written in the voice of the (or possibly a second) narrator,[43][44]usingcounterfactual past-subjunctivetense.[44]It is referred to in a footnote to the book's seventh paragraph.[43][44]Some critics read it as implying the collapse of The Party some time after the year 1984, describing it as a ""happy ending"".[43]It refers to Newspeak as having failed to become dominant.[43]Orwell wrote to his literary agent in 1949, urging that the appendix be retained for the American edition.[44]Characters[edit]Main characters[edit]Winston Smith: the 39-year-old protagonist who is a phlegmaticeverymanharbouring thoughts of rebellion and is curious about the Party's power and the past before the Revolution.Julia: Winston's lover, who publicly espouses Party doctrine as a member of the fanatical Junior Anti-Sex League. Julia enjoys her small acts of rebellion and has no interest in giving up her lifestyle.O'Brien: an Inner Party official who is secretly a member of the Thought Police. He poses as a member of the Brotherhood, the counter-revolutionary resistance, to catch Winston.Big Brother and Emmanuel Goldstein never physically appear, but are important to the plot and have a significant role in theworldbuilding.Big Brother: the leader and figurehead of the Party that rules Oceania. A deepcult of personalityis formed around him. It is not revealed whether he really exists.Emmanuel Goldstein: ostensibly a former leading figure in the Party who became the counter-revolutionary leader of the Brotherhood, and author of the bookThe Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism. Goldstein is the symbolicenemy of the state—the nationalnemesiswho ideologically unites the people of Oceania with the Party, especially during theTwo Minutes Hateand other forms offear-mongering. However, O'Brien claims that the book was actually written by the Party.Secondary characters[edit]Aaronson, Jones and Rutherford: former members of the Inner Party whom Winston vaguely remembers as among the original leaders of the Revolution, long before he had heard of Big Brother. They confessed to treasonable conspiracies with foreign powers and were then executed in the political purges of the 1960s. In between their confessions and executions, Winston saw them drinking in the Chestnut Tree Café—with broken noses, suggesting that their confessions had been obtained by torture. Later, in the course of his editorial work, Winston sees newspaper evidence contradicting their confessions, but drops it into amemory hole. Eleven years later, he is confronted with the same photograph during his interrogation.Ampleforth: Winston's one-time Records Department colleague who was imprisoned for leaving the word ""God"" in a poem byRudyard Kiplingas he could not find another rhyme for ""rod"";[46]Winston encounters him at theMinistry of Love. Ampleforth is a dreamer and intellectual who takes pleasure in his work, and respects poetry and language, traits which cause him disfavour with the Party.Mr Charrington: an undercover officer of theThought Policemasquerading as a kind and sympathetic antiques dealer among the proles.Katharine Smith: the emotionally indifferent wife whom Winston ""can't get rid of"". Despite disliking sexual intercourse, Katharine married Winston because it was their ""duty to the Party"". Although she was a ""goodthinkful"" ideologue, they separated because the couple could not conceive children. Divorce is not permitted, but couples who cannot have children may live separately. For much of the story Winston lives in vague hope that Katharine may die or could be ""got rid of"" so that he may marry Julia. He regrets not having killed her by pushing her over the edge of a quarry when he had the chance many years previously.The Parsons family:Tom Parsons: Winston's naïve neighbour, and an ideal member of the Outer Party: an uneducated, suggestible man who is utterly loyal to the Party, and fully believes in its perfect image. He is socially active and participates in the Party activities for his social class. He is friendly towards Smith, and despite his political conformity punishes his bullying son for firing acatapultat Winston. Later, as a prisoner, Winston sees Parsons imprisoned in the Ministry of Love, after his young daughter reported him to the Thought Police for speaking against Big Brother in his sleep. Even this does not dampen Parsons's belief in the Party—he says he could do ""good work"" in the hard labour camps.Mrs Parsons: Parsons's wife is a wan and hapless woman who is intimidated by her own children.The Parsons children: a nine-year-old son and seven-year-old daughter. Both are members of the Spies, a youth organisation that focuses on indoctrinating children with Party ideals and training them to report any suspected incidents of unorthodoxy. They represent the new generation of Oceanian citizens, the model society envisioned by the Inner Party without memory of life before Big Brother, and without family ties or emotional sentiment.Syme: Winston's colleague at the Ministry of Truth, alexicographerinvolved in compiling a new edition of theNewspeakdictionary. Although he is enthusiastic about his work and support for the Party, Winston notes, ""He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly."" Winston predicts, correctly, that Syme will become an unperson.Sources for literary motifs[edit]Nineteen Eighty-Fouruses themes from life in the Soviet Union and wartime life in Great Britain as sources for many of its motifs. Some time at an unspecified date after the first American publication of the book, the producerSidney Sheldonwrote to Orwell interested in adapting the novel to the Broadway stage. Orwell wrote in a letter to Sheldon (to whom he would sell the US stage rights) that his basic goal withNineteen Eighty-Fourwas imagining the consequences of Stalinist government ruling British society:[Nineteen Eighty-Four] was based chiefly on communism, because that is the dominant form of totalitarianism, but I was trying chiefly to imagine what communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of theRussian Foreign Office.[47]According to Orwell's biographerD. J. TaylorOrwell'sA Clergyman's Daughter(1935) has ""essentially the same plot ofNineteen Eighty-Four... It's about somebody who is spied upon, and eavesdropped upon, and oppressed by vast exterior forces they can do nothing about. It makes an attempt at rebellion and then has to compromise"".[48]A 1931 poster for thefirst five-year planof theSoviet UnionbyYakov Guminer[ru]reading ""The arithmetic of an industrial-financial counter-plan: 2 + 2 plus the enthusiasm of the workers = 5""The statement ""2 + 2 = 5"", used to torment Winston Smith during his interrogation, was a communist party slogan from the secondfive-year plan, which encouraged fulfilment of the five-year plan in four years. The slogan was seen in electric lights on Moscow house-fronts, billboards and elsewhere.[49]The switch of Oceania's allegiance from Eastasia to Eurasia and the subsequent rewriting of history (""Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete""; ch 9) is evocative of the Soviet Union's changing relations with Nazi Germany. The two nations were open and frequently vehement critics of each other until the signing of the 1939Treaty of Non-Aggression. Thereafter, and continuing until theNazi invasion of the Soviet Unionin 1941, no criticism of Germany was allowed in the Soviet press, and all references to prior party lines stopped—including in the majority of non-Russian communist parties who tended to follow the Russian line. Orwell had criticised theCommunist Party of Great Britainfor supporting the Treaty in his essays forBetrayal of the Left(1941). ""The Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 reversed the Soviet Union's stated foreign policy. It was too much for many of thefellow-travellerslikeGollancz[Orwell's sometime publisher] who had put their faith in a strategy of constructionPopular Frontgovernments and the peace bloc between Russia, Britain and France.""[50]Leon TrotskyJoseph StalinDescriptions of Emmanuel Goldstein and Big Brother evoke Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin respectively.The description of Emmanuel Goldstein, with a ""small, goatee beard"", evokes the image ofLeon Trotsky. The film of Goldstein during the Two Minutes Hate is described as showing him being transformed into a bleating sheep. This image was used in a propaganda film during theKino-eyeperiod of Soviet film, which showed Trotsky transforming into a goat.[51][page needed]Like Goldstein, Trotsky was a formerly high-ranking party official who was ostracised and then wrote a book criticising party rule,The Revolution Betrayed, published in 1936.The omnipresent images of Big Brother, a man described as having a moustache, bears resemblance to the cult of personality built up aroundJoseph Stalin.[52]The news in Oceania emphasised production figures, just as it did in the Soviet Union, where record-setting in factories (by ""Heroes of Socialist Labour"") was especially glorified. The best known of these wasAlexei Stakhanov, who purportedly set a record for coal mining in 1935.[53]The tortures of the Ministry of Love evoke the procedures used by theNKVDin their interrogations,[54][page needed]including beatings, deprivation, and torture through the use of their greatest fear.[55]The random bombing of Airstrip One is based on thearea bombingof London byBuzz bombsand theV-2 rocketin 1944–1945.[52]TheThought Policeis based on theNKVD, which arrested people for ""anti-Soviet"" remarks.[56][page needed]The confessions of the ""Thought Criminals"" Rutherford, Aaronson and Jones are based on theshow trialsof the 1930s, which included fabricated confessions by the prominent BolsheviksNikolai Bukharin,Grigory ZinovievandLev Kamenevto the effect that they were being paid by the Nazi government to undermine the Soviet regime underLeon Trotsky's direction.[57]The song ""Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree"" (""Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you, and you sold me"") was based on an old English song called ""Go no more a-rushing"" (""Under the spreading chestnut tree, Where I knelt upon my knee, We were as happy as could be, 'Neath the spreading chestnut tree.""). The song was published as early as 1891. The song was a popular camp song in the 1920s, sung with corresponding movements (like touching one's chest when singing ""chest"", and touching one's head when singing ""nut"").Glenn Millerrecorded the song in 1939.[58]The ""Hates"" (Two Minutes Hate and Hate Week) were inspired by the constant rallies sponsored by party organs throughout the Stalinist period. These were often short pep-talks given to workers before their shifts began (Two Minutes Hate),[59]but could also last for days, as in the annual celebrations of the anniversary of theOctober Revolution(Hate Week).Orwell fictionalised ""newspeak"", ""doublethink"" and ""Ministry of Truth"" based on both the Soviet press, and British wartime usage, such as ""Miniform"".[60]In particular, he adapted Soviet ideological discourse constructed to ensure that public statements could not be questioned.[61]Winston Smith's job, ""revising history"" (and the ""unperson"" motif) are based oncensorship of images in the Soviet Union, which airbrushed images of ""fallen"" people from group photographs and removed references to them in books and newspapers.[63]In one well-known example, the second edition of theGreat Soviet Encyclopediahad an article aboutLavrentiy Beria. After his fall from power and execution, subscribers received a letter from the editor[64]instructing them to cut out and destroy the three-page article on Beria and paste in its place enclosed replacement pages expanding the adjacent articles onF. W. Bergholz(an 18th-century courtier), theBering SeaandBishop Berkeley.[65][66][67]Big Brother's ""Orders of the Day"" were inspired by Stalin's regular wartime orders, called by the same name. A small collection of the more political of these have been published (together with his wartime speeches) in English asOn the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Unionby Joseph Stalin.[68][69]Like Big Brother's orders of the day, Stalin's frequently lauded heroic individuals,[68]like Comrade Ogilvy, the fictitious hero Winston Smith invented to ""rectify"" (fabricate) a Big Brother Order of the day.The Ingsoc slogan ""Our new, happy life"", repeated from telescreens, evokes Stalin's 1935 statement, which became aCPSUslogan, ""Life has become better, Comrades; life has become more cheerful.""[56]In 1940 the Argentine writerJorge Luis Borgespublished ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"", which describes the invention by a ""benevolent secret society"" of a world that would seek to remake human language and reality along human-invented lines. The story concludes with an appendix describing the success of the project. Borges' story addresses similar themes ofepistemology, language and history to 1984.[70]During theSecond World WarOrwell believedBritish democracyas it existed before 1939 would not survive; the question being, ""Would it end via Fascistcoup d'étatfrom above or via Socialist revolution from below?""[71]Later he admitted that events proved him wrong: ""What really matters is that I fell into the trap of assuming that 'the war and the revolution are inseparable'.""[72]In his 1946 essay ""Why I Write"" Orwell explains that the serious works he wrote since theSpanish Civil War(1936–39) were ""written, directly or indirectly, againsttotalitarianismand fordemocratic socialism"".[4][73]Nineteen Eighty-Fouris acautionary taleabout revolution betrayed by totalitarian defenders previously proposed inHomage to Catalonia(1938) andAnimal Farm(1945), whileComing Up for Air(1939) celebrates the personal and political freedoms lost inNineteen Eighty-Four(1949). The biographerMichael Sheldennotes Orwell'sEdwardianchildhood atHenley-on-Thamesas the golden country; being bullied atSt Cyprian's Schoolas his empathy with victims; his life in theIndian Imperial Policein Burma and the techniques of violence and censorship in theBBCas capricious authority.[74]Other influences includeDarkness at Noon(1940) andThe Yogi and the Commissar(1945) byArthur Koestler;The Iron Heel(1908) byJack London;1920: Dips into the Near Future[75]byJohn A. Hobson;Brave New World(1932) byAldous Huxley;We(1921) by Yevgeny Zamyatin which he reviewed in 1946;[76]andThe Managerial Revolution(1940) byJames Burnhampredicting perpetual war among three totalitarian superstates. Orwell told the writerJacintha Buddicomthat he would write a novel stylistically likeA Modern Utopia(1905) byH. G. Wells.[77]Extrapolating from the Second World War, the novel'spasticheparallels the politics and rhetoric at war's end—the changed alliances at the ""Cold War's"" (1945–91) beginning; theMinistry of Truthderives from the BBC's overseas service, controlled by theMinistry of Information;Room 101derives from a conference room at BBCBroadcasting House;[78]theSenate Houseof the University of London, containing the Ministry of Information is the architectural inspiration for the Minitrue; the post-war decrepitude derives from the socio-political life of the UK and the US, i.e., the impoverished Britain of 1948 losing its Empire despite newspaper-reported imperial triumph; and war ally but peace-time foe, Soviet Russia becameEurasia.[79]The term ""English Socialism"" has precedents in Orwell's wartime writings; in the essay ""The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius"" (1941), he said that ""the war and the revolution are inseparable... the fact that we are at war has turned Socialism from a textbook word into a realisable policy""—because Britain's superannuated social class system hindered the war effort and only a socialist economy would defeatAdolf Hitler. Given the middle class's grasping this, they too would abide socialist revolution and that only reactionary Britons would oppose it, thus limiting the force revolutionaries would need to take power. An English Socialism would come about which ""will never lose touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that is above the State. It will shoot traitors, but it will give them a solemn trial beforehand and occasionally it will acquit them. It will crush any open revolt promptly and cruelly, but it will interfere very little with the spoken and written word.""[80]In the world ofNineteen Eighty-Four""English Socialism"" (or ""Ingsoc"" inNewspeak) is atotalitarianideology unlike the English revolution he foresaw. Comparison of the wartime essay ""The Lion and the Unicorn"" withNineteen Eighty-Fourshows that he perceived a Big Brother regime as a perversion of his cherished socialist ideals and English Socialism. Thus Oceania is a corruption of the British Empire he believed would evolve ""into a federation of Socialist states, like a looser and freer version of the Union of Soviet Republics"".[81][verification needed]Themes[edit]Nationalism[edit]Nineteen Eighty-Fourexpands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell's essay ""Notes on Nationalism""[82]about the lack of vocabulary needed to explain the unrecognised phenomena behind certain political forces. InNineteen Eighty-Four, the Party's artificial, minimalist language 'Newspeak' addresses the matter.Positive nationalism: For instance, Oceanians' perpetual love for Big Brother. Orwell argues in the essay that ideologies such asNeo-ToryismandCeltic nationalismare defined by their obsessive sense of loyalty to some entity.Negative nationalism: For instance, Oceanians' perpetual hatred for Emmanuel Goldstein. Orwell argues in the essay that ideologies such asTrotskyismandantisemitismare defined by their obsessive hatred of some entity.Transferred nationalism: For instance, when Oceania's enemy changes, an orator makes a change mid-sentence, and the crowd instantly transfers its hatred to the new enemy. Orwell argues that ideologies such asStalinism[83]and redirected feelings of racial animus and class superiority among wealthy intellectuals exemplify this. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions from one power unit to another. In the novel, it happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say that they must be the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs had always been the case.O'Brien concludes: ""The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.""[84]Futurology[edit]In the novel O'Brien describes the Party's vision of the future:There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always—do not forget this, Winston—always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—forever.—Part III, chapter III,Nineteen Eighty-FourCensorship[edit]One of the most notable themes inNineteen Eighty-Fouriscensorship, especially in the Ministry of Truth, where photographs and public archives are manipulated to rid them of ""unpersons"" (people who have been erased from history by the Party).[85]On the telescreens, almost all figures of production are grossly exaggerated or simply fabricated to indicate an ever-growing economy, even during times when the reality is the opposite. One small example of the endless censorship is Winston being charged with the task of eliminating a reference to an unperson in a newspaper article. He also proceeds to write an article about Comrade Ogilvy, a made-up party member who allegedly ""displayed great heroism by leaping into the sea from a helicopter so that the dispatches he was carrying would not fall into enemy hands.""[86]Surveillance[edit]This sectiondoes notciteanysources.Please helpimprove this sectionbyadding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged andremoved.(June 2022)(Learn how and when to remove this message)In Oceania the upper and middle classes have very little true privacy. All of their houses and apartments are equipped with two-way telescreens so that they may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something as small as a suspicious facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens are compelled to obedience.Poverty and inequality[edit]Almost the entire world lives in poverty; hunger, thirst, disease and filth are the norms. Ruined cities and towns are common: the consequence of perpetual wars and extreme economic inefficiency. Social decay and wrecked buildings surround Winston; aside from the ministries' headquarters, little of London was rebuilt. Middle-class citizens and proles consume synthetic foodstuffs and poor-quality ""luxuries"" such as oily gin and loosely-packed cigarettes, distributed under the ""Victory"" brand, a parody of the low-quality Indian-made ""Victory"" cigarettes, which British soldiers commonly smoked during the Second World War.Winston describes something as simple as the repair of a broken window as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All upper-class and middle-class residences include telescreens that serve both as outlets for propaganda and surveillance devices that allow the Thought Police to monitor them; they can be turned down, but the ones in middle-class residences cannot be turned off.In contrast to their subordinates, the upper class of Oceanian society reside in clean and comfortable flats in their own quarters, with pantries well-stocked with foodstuffs such as wine, real coffee, real tea, real milk and real sugar, all denied to the general populace.[87]Winston is astonished that the lifts in O'Brien's building work, the telescreens can be completely turned off, and O'Brien has an Asian manservant, Martin. All upper-class citizens are attended to by slaves captured in the ""disputed zone"", and ""The Book"" suggests that many have their own cars or even helicopters.However, despite their insulation and overt privileges, the upper class are still not exempt from the government's brutal restriction of thought and behaviour, even while lies and propaganda apparently originate from their own ranks. Instead, the Oceanian government offers the upper class their ""luxuries"" in exchange for maintaining their loyalty to the state; non-conformant upper-class citizens can still be condemned, tortured, and executed just like any other individual. ""The Book"" makes clear that the upper class' living conditions are only ""relatively"" comfortable, and would be regarded as ""austere"" by those of the pre-revolutionary élite.[88]The proles live in poverty and are kept sedated with pornography, a national lottery whose big prizes are reported won by non-existent people, and gin, ""which the proles were not supposed to drink"". At the same time, the proles are freer and less intimidated than the upper classes: they are not expected to be particularly patriotic and the levels of surveillance that they are subjected to are very low; they lack telescreens in their own homes. ""The Book"" indicates that because the middle class, not the lower class, traditionally starts revolutions, the model demands tight control of the middle class, with ambitious Outer-Party members neutralised via promotion to the Inner Party or ""reintegration"" (brainwashing via psychological and physical torture) by the Ministry of Love, and proles can be allowed intellectual freedom because they are deemed to lack intellect. Winston nonetheless believes that ""the future belonged to the proles"".[89]The standard of living of the populace is extremely low overall.[90]Consumer goods are scarce, and those available through official channels are of low quality; for instance, despite the Party regularly reporting increased boot production, more than half of the Oceanian populace goes barefoot.[91]The Party claims that poverty is a necessary sacrifice for the war effort, and ""The Book"" confirms that to be partially correct since the purpose of perpetual war is to consume surplus industrial production.[92]As ""The Book"" explains, society is in fact designed to remain on the brink of starvation, as ""In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.""Thought monitoring[edit]The Party monitorsfacial expressionsand aims to find out and control thethoughtsof citizens through the ""Thought Police"" and the detection and elimination of ""thoughtcrime"". The Party rejects thelegal principle""Cogitationis poenam nemo patitur"" (""Thought does not commit a crime"").It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself—anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced, for example) was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it inNewspeak: FACECRIME, it was called.[93]One is how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, (...) The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor, studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions, gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; (...)[94]We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about.[95]Critical reception[edit]When it was first published,Nineteen Eighty-Fourreceived critical acclaim.V. S. Pritchett, reviewing it for theNew Statesman, wrote: ""I do not think I have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing; and yet, such are the originality, the suspense, the speed of writing and withering indignation that it is impossible to put the book down.""[96]P. H. Newby, reviewingNineteen Eighty-FourforThe Listenermagazine, described it as ""the most arresting political novel written by an Englishman sinceRex Warner'sThe Aerodrome.""[97]Nineteen Eighty-Fourwas also praised byBertrand Russell,E. M. ForsterandHarold Nicolson.[97]On the other hand,Edward Shanks, reviewingNineteen Eighty-FourforThe Sunday Times, was dismissive, sayingNineteen Eighty-Four""breaks all records for gloomy vaticination"".[97]C. S. Lewiswas also critical of the novel, claiming that the relationship of Julia and Winston, and especially the Party's view on sex, lacked credibility, and that the setting was ""odious rather than tragic"".[98]The historianIsaac Deutscherwas far more critical of Orwell from aMarxistperspective, and characterised him as a “simple mindedanarchist”. Deutscher argued that Orwell had struggled to comprehend the dialectical philosophy of Marxism, demonstrated personal ambivalence towardsother strands of socialism, and thatNineteen Eighty-Fourhad been appropriated for the purpose of anti-communistCold Warpropaganda.[99][100]Upon its publication many American reviewers interpreted it as a statement on the socialist policies of theBritish prime minister,Clement Attlee, or the policies of Joseph Stalin.[101]Serving as prime ministerfrom 1945 to 1951, Attlee implemented wide-ranging social reforms and changes in the British economy following the Second World War. The American trade union leader Francis A. Hanson wanted to recommend the book to his members, but was concerned with some of the reviews it had received, so Orwell wrote a letter to him.[102][101]In it he described his novel as a satire, and said:I do not believe that the kind of society I describe will necessarily arrive, but I believe (allowing, of course, for the fact that the book is a satire) that something resembling it could arrive...[it is] a show...[of the] perversions to which a centralised economy is liable and which have already been partly realisable in communism and fascism.—George Orwell, Letter to Francis A. HansonThroughout its publication historyNineteen Eighty-Fourhas beenbannedand legally challenged as subversive or ideologically corrupting, like the dystopian novelsWe(1924) byYevgeny Zamyatin,Brave New World(1932) byAldous Huxley,Darkness at Noon(1940) byArthur Koestler,Kallocain(1940) byKarin BoyeandFahrenheit 451(1953) byRay Bradbury.[103]On 5 November 2019 the BBC namedNineteen Eighty-Fouron its list of the100 most influential novels.[104]According toCzesław Miłosz, adefectorfromStalinist Poland, the book also made an impression behind theIron Curtain. Writing inThe Captive Mind, he stated ""[a] few have become acquainted with Orwell's1984; because it is both difficult to obtain and dangerous to possess, it is known only to certain members of the Inner Party. Orwell fascinates them through his insight into details they know well ... Even those who know Orwell only by hearsay are amazed that a writer who never lived in Russia should have so keen a perception into its life.""[105][106]The writerChristopher Hitchenshas called this ""one of the greatest compliments that one writer has ever bestowed upon another ... Only one or two years after Orwell's death, in other words, his book about a secret book circulated only within the Inner Party was itself a secret book circulated only within the Inner Party.""[105]: 54–55Adaptations in other media[edit]Main article:Adaptations of Nineteen Eighty-FourIn the same year as the novel's publishing, a one-hour radio adaptation was aired on the United States'NBCradio network as part of theNBC University Theatreseries. Thefirst television adaptationappeared as part ofCBS'sStudio Oneseries in September 1953.[107]BBC Televisionbroadcastan adaptationbyNigel Knealein December 1954. The first feature film adaptation,1984, was released in 1956. A second feature-length adaptation,Nineteen Eighty-Four,followed in 1984, a reasonably faithful adaptation. The story has been adapted several other times to radio, television and film; other media adaptations include theatre (a musical[108]anda play),an operaand ballet.[109]An audio dramatisation was released in 2024 to critical acclaim, starringAndrew Garfieldas Winston.Translations[edit]Nineteen Eighty-FourRussian version published in theSoviet Unionin 1984. A limited edition, only for members of theCentral Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.The novel was banned in the Soviet Union until 1988, when the first publicly available Russian version in the country, translated by Vyacheslav Nedoshivin, was published inKodry, a literary journal of Soviet Moldavia. In 1989 another Russian version, translated byViktor Golyshev, was also published. Outside the Soviet Union, the first Russian version was serialised in the emigre magazineGraniin the mid-1950s, then published as a book in 1957 in Frankfurt. Another Russian version, translated by Sergei Tolstoy from a French version, was published in Rome in 1966. These translations were smuggled into the Soviet Union and became quite popular among dissidents.[110]Some underground published translations also appeared in the Soviet Union. The Soviet philosopherEvald Ilyenkovtranslated it from German into Russian.[111]For the Soviet elite, as early as 1959, according to the order of the Ideological Department of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, the Foreign Literature Publishers secretly issued a Russian version of the novel, for the senior officers of the Communist Party.[112]In thePeople's Republic of Chinathe firstSimplified Chineseversion, translated byDong Leshan, was serialised in the periodicalSelected Translations from Foreign Literaturein 1979, for senior officials and intellectuals deemed politically reliable enough. In 1985 the Chinese version was published by Huacheng Publishing House, as a restricted publication. It was first available to the general public in 1988, by the same publisher.[113]Amy Hawkins and Jeffrey Wasserstrom ofThe Atlanticstated in 2019 that the book is widely available in mainland China for several reasons: the general public largely no longer read books; because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway; and because the Communist Party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as a liability. The authors stated, ""It was—and remains—as easy to buy1984andAnimal FarminShenzhenor Shanghai as it is in London or Los Angeles.""[114]They also stated that ""The assumption is not that Chinese people can't figure out the meaning of1984, but that the small number of people who will bother to read it won't pose much of a threat.""[114]The journalistMichael Rankargued that it is only because the novel is set in London and written by a foreigner that the Chinese authorities believe it has nothing to do with China.[113]By 1989Nineteen Eighty-Fourhad been translated into 65 languages, more than any other novel in English at that time.[115]The amateur translator Tsiu Ing-sing'sTaiwanese Hokkientranslation, which usesromanisationalongside Chinese characters, was published in 2025.[116]Cultural impact[edit]""Happy 1984"" (in Spanish or Portuguese) stencilgraffition a standing piece of theBerlin Wall, 2005The effect ofNineteen Eighty-Fouron the English language is extensive; the concepts ofBig Brother,Room 101, theThought Police,thoughtcrime,unperson,memory hole(oblivion),doublethink(simultaneously holding and believing contradictory beliefs) andNewspeak(ideological language) have become common phrases for denoting totalitarian authority.Doublespeakandgroupthinkare both deliberate elaborations ofdoublethink, and the adjective ""Orwellian"" means similar to Orwell's writings, especiallyNineteen Eighty-Four. The practice of ending words with""-speak""(such asmediaspeak) is drawn from the novel.[117]Orwell is perpetually associated with 1984; in July 1984an asteroidwas discovered byAntonín Mrkosand named after Orwell.References to the themes, concepts and plot ofNineteen Eighty-Fourhave appeared frequently in other works, especially in popular music and video entertainment. An example is the worldwide hit reality television showBig Brother, in which a group of people live together in a large house, isolated from the outside world but continuously watched by television cameras.Noam Chomskyadapted Orwell'sneologism""unpeople"" to describe those whom the state deems ""unfit to enter history"" and whom the state strips of the right to live in order to advance the state's sovereignty.[118]: 313In November 2012 theUnited States federal governmentargued before theUS Supreme Courtthat it could continue touse GPS tracking of individualswithout first seeking a warrant. In response, JusticeStephen Breyerquestioned what that means for a democratic society by referencingNineteen Eighty-Four, stating ""If you win this case, then there is nothing to prevent the police or the government from monitoring 24 hours a day the public movement of every citizen of the United States. So if you win, you suddenly produce what sounds like1984...""[119]The book touches on the invasion of privacy and ubiquitous surveillance. From mid-2013 it was publicised that the AmericanNational Security Agencyhas been secretly monitoring and storing global internet traffic, including the bulk data collection of email and phone call data. Sales ofNineteen Eighty-Fourincreased by up to seven times within the first week of the2013 mass surveillance leaks.[120][121][122]The book again topped theAmazon.comsales charts in 2017 after a controversy involvingKellyanne Conwayusing the phrase ""alternative facts"" to explain discrepancies with the media.[123][124][125][126]Nineteen Eighty-Fourwas number three on the list of ""Top Check Outs of All Time"" by theNew York Public Library.[127]Nineteen Eighty-Fourenteredthe public domain on 1 January 2021, 70 years after Orwell's death, in most of the world. It is still under copyright in the US until 95 years after publication, or 2044.[128][129]Brave New Worldcomparisons[edit]Further information:Brave New World § Comparisons with George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-FourIn October 1949, after readingNineteen Eighty-Four, Huxley sent a letter to Orwell in which he argued that it would be more efficient for rulers to stay in power by the softer touch by allowing citizens to seek pleasure to control them rather than use brute force. He wrote:Whether in actual fact the policy of the boot-on-the-face can go on indefinitely seems doubtful. My own belief is that the ruling oligarchy will find less arduous and wasteful ways of governing and of satisfying its lust for power, and these ways will resemble those which I described in Brave New World....Within the next generation I believe that the world's rulers will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging and kicking them into obedience.[130]In the decades since the publication ofNineteen Eighty-Four, there have been numerous comparisons to Huxley'sBrave New World, which had been published 17 years earlier, in 1932.[131][132][133][134]They are both predictions of societies dominated by a central government and are both based on extensions of the trends of their times. However, members of the ruling class ofNineteen Eighty-Fouruse brutal force, torture and harshmind controlto keep individuals in line, while rulers inBrave New Worldkeep the citizens in line by drugs, hypnosis, genetic conditioning and pleasurable distractions. Regarding censorship, inNineteen Eighty-Fourthe government tightly controls information to keep the population in line, but in Huxley's world, so much information is published that readers are easily distracted and overlook the information that is relevant.[135]Elements of both novels can be seen in modern-day societies, with Huxley's vision being more dominant in the West and Orwell's vision more prevalent with dictatorships, including those in communist countries (such as in modern-dayChinaandNorth Korea), as is pointed out in essays that compare the two novels, including Huxley's ownBrave New World Revisited.[136][137][138][126]Comparisons with later dystopian novels likeThe Handmaid's Tale,Virtual Light,The Private EyeandThe Children of Menhave also been drawn.[139][140]In popular culture[edit]Main article:Nineteen Eighty-Four in popular mediaIn 1955 an episode of BBC'sThe Goon Show,1985, was broadcast, written bySpike MilliganandEric Sykesand based onNigel Kneale'stelevision adaptation. It was re-recorded about a month later with the same script but a slightly different cast.[141]1985parodies many of the main scenes in Orwell's novel.In 1970 the American rock groupSpiritreleased the song ""1984"" based on Orwell's novel.In 1973 the ex–Soft MachinebassistHugh Hopperreleased an album called1984on the Columbia label (UK), consisting of instrumentals with Orwellian titles such as ""Miniluv"", ""Minipax"", ""Minitrue"" and so forth.In 1974David Bowiereleased the albumDiamond Dogs, which is thought to be loosely based onNineteen Eighty-Four. It includes the tracks ""We Are the Dead"", ""1984"" and ""Big Brother"". Before the album was made, Bowie's management (MainMan) had planned for Bowie and Tony Ingrassia (MainMan's creative consultant) to co-write and direct a musical production of Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four, but Orwell's widow refused to give MainMan the rights.[142][143]In 1977 the British rock bandthe Jamreleased the albumThis Is the Modern World, which includes the track ""Standards"" byPaul Weller. This track concludes with the lyrics ""...and ignorance is strength, we have God on our side, look, you know what happened to Winston.""[144]In 1984Ridley Scottdirected a television commercial, ""1984"", to launchApple'sMacintoshcomputer.[145]The advertisement stated, ""1984 won't be like1984"", suggesting that the Apple Mac would be freedom from Big Brother, i.e., the IBM PC.[146]Rage Against the Machine's 2000 single, ""Testify"", from their albumThe Battle of Los Angeles, features the use of ""The Party"" slogan, ""Who controls the past(now), controls the future. Who controls the present(now), controls the past.""[144]An episode ofDoctor Who, ""The God Complex"", depicts an alien ship disguised as a hotel containing Room 101-like spaces, and also, like the novel, quotes the nursery rhyme ""Oranges and Lemons"".[147]The two-part episodeChain of CommandonStar Trek: The Next Generationbears some resemblances to the novel.[148]Radiohead's 2003 single ""2 + 2 = 5"", from their albumHail to the Thief, is Orwellian by title and content.Thom Yorkestates, ""I was listening to a lot of political programs onBBC Radio 4. I found myself writing down little nonsense phrases, those Orwellian euphemisms that [the British and American governments] are so fond of. They became the background of the record.""[144]In September 2009 the English rock bandMusereleasedThe Resistance, which included songs influenced byNineteen Eighty-Four.[149]InMarilyn Manson's autobiographyThe Long Hard Road Out of Hell, he states: ""I was thoroughly terrified by the idea of the end of the world and the Antichrist. So I became obsessed with it... reading prophetic books like... 1984 by George Orwell...""[150]The English bandBastillereference the novel in their song ""Back to the Future"", the fifth track on their 2022 albumGive Me the Future, in the opening lyrics: ""Feels like we danced into a nightmare/We're living 1984/If doublethink's no longer fiction/We'll dream of Huxley's Island shores.""[151]Released in 2004, KAKU P-Model/Susumu Hirasawa's song ""Big Brother"" directly references1984, and the album itself is about a fictional dystopia in a distant future.The Usedreleased a song by the same name, ""1984"", on their 2020 albumHeartwork.[152]See also[edit]United Kingdom portalNovels portalSpeculative fiction portalPolitics portalAuthoritarian personalityBrainwashingClosed-circuit television(CCTV)Culture of fearFahrenheit 451, a similar novel revolving around censorshipIdeocracyLanguage and thoughtList of stories set in a future now in the pastMass surveillanceNew World Order (conspiracy theory)Psychological projectionScapegoatingTotalitarianismUtopian and dystopian fictionV for Vendetta, a similar graphic novel andfilmWe, a similar novelReferences[edit]Citations[edit]^""Nineteen Eighty-Four"".knowthyshelf.com. 13 August 2015.

His wife lacks an inheritance, so his family faces becoming poor upon his death. Thus, it is imperative that at least one of the daughters marry well to support the others, which is a primary motivation driving the plot.Pride and Prejudicehas consistently appeared near the top of lists of ""most-loved books"" among literary scholars and the reading public. It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, with over 20 million copies sold, and has inspired many derivatives in modern literature.[1][2]For more than a century, dramatic adaptations, reprints, unofficial sequels, films, and TV versions ofPride and Prejudicehave portrayed the memorable characters and themes of the novel, reaching mass audiences.[3]Plot summary[edit]Mr. Darcy says Elizabeth is ""not handsome enough to tempt him"" to dance. (Artist:C.E. Brock, 1895)In the early 19th century, theBennet familylives at their Longbourn estate, situated near the village of Meryton inHertfordshire, England. Mrs. Bennet's greatest desire is to marry off her five daughters to secure their futures.The arrival of Mr. Bingley, a rich bachelor who rents the neighbouring Netherfield estate, gives her hope that one of her daughters might contract a marriage to the advantage, because, as stated in the novel'sopening sentence, ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife"". At a ball, the family is introduced to the Netherfield party, including Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, Caroline, who is unmarried, and Louisa, who is married to Mr. Hurst, and his closest friendMr. Darcy. Mr. Bingley's friendly and cheerful manner earns him popularity among the guests. He appears interested in Jane, the eldest Bennet daughter. Mr. Darcy, reputed to be twice as wealthy as Mr. Bingley, is haughty and aloof, causing a decided dislike of him. He declines to dance withElizabeth, the second-eldest Bennet daughter, as she is ""not handsome enough"". Although she jokes about it with her friend, Elizabeth is deeply offended. Despite this first impression, Mr. Darcy secretly begins to find himself drawn to Elizabeth as they continue to encounter each other at social events, appreciating her wit and frankness.Mr. Collins, the heir to the Longbourn estate, visits the Bennet family with the intention of finding a wife among the five girls under the advice of his patronessLady Catherine de Bourgh, also revealed to be Mr. Darcy's aunt. He decides to pursue Elizabeth. The Bennet family meets the charming army officerGeorge Wickham, who tells Elizabeth in confidence that Mr. Darcy had treated him unpleasantly in the past. Elizabeth's prejudice toward Mr. Darcy leads her to believe Wickham. Elizabeth dances with Mr. Darcy at a ball where Mrs. Bennet hints loudly that she expects Jane and Bingley to become engaged. Elizabeth rejects Mr. Collins' marriage proposal, to her mother's fury and her father's relief. Mr. Collins subsequently proposes to Charlotte Lucas, a friend of Elizabeth's, and is accepted. Having heard Mrs. Bennet's words at the ball, and disapproving of the marriage, Mr. Darcy joins Mr. Bingley in a trip to London and, with the help of his sisters, persuades him not to return to Netherfield. A heartbroken Jane visits her Aunt and Uncle Gardiner in London to raise her spirits, while Elizabeth's hatred for Mr. Darcy grows, as she suspects he was responsible for Mr. Bingley's departure.In the spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte and Mr. Collins inKent. Elizabeth and her hosts are invited to Rosings Park, Lady Catherine's home. Mr. Darcy and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, are also visiting Rosings Park. Fitzwilliam tells Elizabeth how Mr. Darcy recently saved a friend, presumably Bingley, from an undesirable match. Elizabeth realises that the prevented engagement was to Jane. Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, declaring his love for her despite her low social connections. She is shocked, as she was unaware of Mr. Darcy's interest, and rejects him angrily, saying that he is the last person she would ever marry and that she could never love a man who caused her sister such unhappiness; she further accuses him of treating Wickham unjustly. Mr. Darcy brags about his success in separating Bingley and Jane and sarcastically dismisses the accusation regarding Wickham without addressing it. The next day, Mr. Darcy gives Elizabeth a letter explaining that Wickham, the son of his late father's steward, had refused the ""living"" his father had arranged for him and was instead given money for it. Wickham quickly squandered the money and tried to elope with Darcy's 15-year-old sister, Georgiana, for her considerabledowry. Mr. Darcy also writes that he separated Jane and Bingley because he believed her to be indifferent to Bingley and because of the lack of propriety displayed by her family. Elizabeth is ashamed by her family's behaviour and her own prejudice against Mr. Darcy.Elizabeth tells her father that Darcy united Lydia and Wickham – one of the two earliest illustrations ofPride and Prejudice.[4]The fashions reflect the engraving date (1830s), not the period of the novel.Months later, Elizabeth accompanies the Gardiners on a tour ofDerbyshire. They persuade Elizabeth to visitPemberley, Darcy's estate, noting that he is unlikely to be at home. When Mr. Darcy returns unexpectedly, he is exceedingly gracious with Elizabeth and the Gardiners. Elizabeth is surprised by Darcy's behaviour and grows fond of him, even coming to regret rejecting his proposal. She receives news that her sister Lydia has run off with Wickham. She tells Mr. Darcy; both depart in haste. After an agonising interim, Wickham agrees to marry Lydia; all assume that Gardiner has paid Wickham. Lydia and Wickham visit the Bennet family at Longbourn; Lydia tells Elizabeth that Mr. Darcy was at her wedding. Though Mr. Darcy had sworn everyone involved to secrecy, Mrs. Gardiner now feels obliged to inform Elizabeth that he secured the match, at great expense and trouble to himself.Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy return to Netherfield. Jane accepts Mr. Bingley's proposal. Lady Catherine, having heard rumours that Elizabeth intends to marry Mr. Darcy, visits her and demands she promise never to accept Mr. Darcy's proposal, as she and Darcy's late mother had already planned his marriage to her daughter Anne. Elizabeth refuses and asks the outraged Lady Catherine to leave. Darcy, heartened by his aunt's indignant relaying of Elizabeth's response, again proposes to her and is accepted.Characters[edit]Character genealogyMr. HurstMrs. Louisa HurstMr. PhilipsCaroline BingleyMrs. PhilipsMr. Charles BingleyMrs. GardinerJane BennetMr. Edward GardinerElizabeth BennetMrs. BennetMary BennetMr. BennetCatherine ""Kitty"" BennetMr. William CollinsLydia BennetCharlotte LucasMr. George Wickham(Old) Mr. DarcyMr.Fitzwilliam DarcyLady Anne DarcyGeorgiana DarcyLady Catherine de BourghAnne de Bourgh(Fitzwilliam Darcy)Colonel FitzwilliamScenes fromPride and Prejudice, byC. E. Brock(c. 1885)Elizabeth and Mr Darcy byHugh Thomson, 1894Elizabeth Bennet– the second-eldest of the Bennet daughters, she is attractive, witty and intelligent – but with a tendency to form tenacious and prejudiced first impressions. As the story progresses, so does her tumultuous relationship with Mr. Darcy. The course of Elizabeth and Darcy's relationship is ultimately decided when Darcy overcomes his pride, and Elizabeth overcomes her prejudice, leading them both to surrender to their love for each other.Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy– Mr. Bingley's friend and the wealthy owner of the estate ofPemberleyin Derbyshire, said to be worth at least £10,000 a year. Although he is handsome, tall, and intelligent, Darcy lacks ease andsocial graces, so others frequently mistake his initially haughty reserve as proof of excessive pride. A new visitor to the Meryton setting of the novel, he is ultimately Elizabeth Bennet's love interest. Though he appears to be proud and is largely disliked by people for this reason, his servants vouch for his kindness and decency.Mr. Bennet– A logical and reasonable late-middle-agedlanded gentlemanof a more modest income of £2,000 per annum, and the dryly sarcastic patriarch of theBennet family, with five unmarried daughters. His estate, Longbourn, isentailedto the male line. His affection for his wife wore off early in their marriage and is now reduced to mere toleration. He is often described as 'indolent' in the novel.Mrs. Bennet(néeGardiner)– the middle-aged wife of Mr. Bennet, and the mother of their five daughters. Mrs. Bennet is ahypochondriacwho imagines herself susceptible to attacks of tremors and palpitations (her ""poor nerves"") whenever things are not going her way. She is silly, frivolous, and tactless, and is given to embarrassing her husband and older daughters. Her main ambition in life is to marry her daughters off to wealthy men. Whether or not any such matches will give her daughters happiness is of little concern to her. She was settled adowryof £4,000 from her father.In a letter to Cassandra dated May 1813, Jane Austen describes a picture she saw at a gallery which was a good likeness of ""Mrs. Bingley"" – Jane Bennet. Deirdre Le Faye inThe World of Her Novelssuggests that ""Portrait of Mrs Q"" is the picture Austen was referring to. (pp. 201–203)Jane Bennet– the eldest Bennet sister. She is considered the most beautiful young lady in the neighbourhood and is inclined to see only the good in others (but can be persuaded otherwise on sufficient evidence). She falls in love with Charles Bingley, a rich young man recently moved to Hertfordshire and a close friend of Mr. Darcy.Mary Bennet– the middle Bennet sister, and the plainest of her siblings. Mary has a serious disposition and mostly reads and plays music, although she is often impatient to display her accomplishments and is rather vain about them. She frequently moralises to her family. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh'sA Memoir of Jane Austen, Mary ended up marrying one of her Uncle Philips' law clerks and moving into Meryton with him.Catherine ""Kitty"" Bennet– the fourth Bennet daughter. Though older than Lydia, she is her shadow and follows her in her pursuit of the officers of the militia. She is often portrayed as envious of Lydia and is described as a ""silly"" young woman. However, it is said that she improved when removed from Lydia's influence. According to James Edward Austen-Leigh'sA Memoir of Jane Austen, Kitty later married a clergyman who lived near Pemberley.Lydia Bennet– the youngest Bennet sister. She is frivolous, headstrong, irresponsible, and spoiled, and is her mother's favorite. Her main activity in life is socialising, especially flirting with the officers of the militia. This leads to her running off with George Wickham, although he has no intention of marrying her. Lydia shows no regard for the moral code of her society; as Ashley Tauchert says, she ""feels without reasoning"".[5]Charles Bingley– a handsome, amiable, and wealthy young man who leases Netherfield Park with hopes of purchasing it. Though genial and well-mannered, he is easily influenced by his friend Mr. Darcy and his sisters' opinion, which leads to the disruption of his romance with Jane Bennet. He inherited a fortune of £100,000.[6]Caroline Bingley– the snobbish sister of Charles Bingley, with a fortune of £20,000. She harbours designs on Mr. Darcy and is jealous of his growing attachment to Elizabeth. She also disapproves of her brother's admiration for Jane Bennet and is disdainful of Meryton society, driven by her vanity and desire for social elevation.George Wickham– Wickham is a charming but reprehensible cad. He has been acquainted with Mr. Darcy since infancy, being the son of Mr. Darcy's father's steward. An officer in the militia, he is superficially charming and rapidly forms an attachment with Elizabeth Bennet. He later runs off with Lydia with no intention of marriage, which would have resulted in her and her family's complete disgrace, but for Darcy's intervention to bribe Wickham to marry her by paying off his immediate debts.Mr. William Collins– Mr. Collins is Mr. Bennet's distant second cousin, a clergyman, and the current heir presumptive to his estate of Longbourn House. He is an obsequious and pompous man, prone to making long and tedious speeches, who is excessively devoted to his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh.Lady Catherine de Bourgh– the overbearing aunt of Mr. Darcy. Lady Catherine is the wealthy owner of Rosings Park, where she resides with her daughter Anne and is fawned upon by her rector, Mr. Collins. She is haughty, pompous, domineering, and condescending and has long planned to marry off her sickly daughter to Darcy to 'unite their two great estates', claiming it to be the dearest wish of both her and her late sister, Lady Anne Darcy (née Fitzwilliam).Mr. Edward Gardiner and Mrs. Gardiner– Edward Gardiner is Mrs. Bennet's brother and a successful tradesman of sensible and gentlemanly character. Aunt Gardiner is genteel and elegant and is close to her nieces Jane and Elizabeth. The Gardiners are the parents of four children. They are instrumental in bringing about the marriage between Darcy and Elizabeth.Georgiana Darcy– Georgiana is Mr. Darcy's quiet, amiable and shy younger sister, with a dowry of £30,000, and is 16 when the story begins. When still 15, Miss Darcy almost eloped with Mr. Wickham but was saved by her brother, whom she idolises. Thanks to years of tutelage under masters, she is accomplished at the piano, singing, playing the harp, drawing, and modern languages and is therefore described as Caroline Bingley's idea of an ""accomplished woman"".Charlotte Lucas– Elizabeth's 27-year-old friend. She marries Mr. Collins for financial security, fearing becoming a burden to her family. Austen uses Charlotte's decision to illustrate how women of the time often married out of convenience rather than love, without condemning her choice.[7]Charlotte is the daughter of Sir William Lucas and Lady Lucas, neighbours of the Bennet family.Colonel Fitzwilliam– Colonel Fitzwilliam is the younger son of an earl and the nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy; this makes him the cousin of Anne de Bourgh and the Darcy siblings, Fitzwilliam and Georgiana. He is about 30 years old at the beginning of the novel. He is the coguardian of Miss Georgiana Darcy, along with his cousin, Mr. Darcy. According to Colonel Fitzwilliam, as a younger son, he cannot marry without thought to his prospective bride's dowry.Diagram showing relationships among the principal characters ofPride and PrejudiceMajor themes[edit]Many critics take the title as the start when analysing the themes ofPride and Prejudicebut Robert Fox cautions against reading too much into the title (which was initiallyFirst Impressions), because commercial factors may have played a role in its selection. ""After the success ofSense and Sensibility, nothing would have seemed more natural than to bring out another novel of the same author using again the formula of antithesis and alliteration for the title.""The qualities of the title are not exclusively assigned to one or the other of the protagonists; both Elizabeth and Darcy display pride and prejudice.""[8]The phrase ""pride and prejudice"" had been used over the preceding two centuries byJoseph Hall,Jeremy Taylor,Joseph AddisonandSamuel Johnson.[9][10]Austen is thought to have taken her title from a passage inFanny Burney'sCecilia(1782), a novel she is known to have admired:""The whole of this unfortunate business,"" said Dr. Lyster, ""has been the result of PRIDE and PREJUDICE. ... if to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to PRIDE and PREJUDICE you will also owe their termination.""[10][11](capitalisation as in the original)A theme in much of Austen's work is the importance of environment and upbringing in developing young people's character and morality.[12]Social standing and wealth are not necessarily advantages in her works, and a further theme common to Austen's work is ineffectual parents. InPride and Prejudice, the failure of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as parents is blamed for Lydia's lack of moral judgment. Darcy has been taught to be principled and scrupulously honourable but he is also proud and overbearing.[12]Kitty, rescued from Lydia's bad influence and spending more time with her older sisters after they marry, is said to improve greatly in their superior society.[13]The American novelistAnna Quindlenobserved in an introduction to an edition of Austen's novel in 1995:Pride and Prejudiceis also about that thing that all great novels consider, the search for self. And it is the first great novel that teaches us this search is as surely undertaken in thedrawing roommakingsmall talkas in the pursuit of agreat white whaleor thepublic punishment of adultery.[14]Marriage[edit]Main article:Marriage in the works of Jane AustenThe opening line of the novel announces: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""[15]This sets marriage as amotifand a central idea in the novel. Readers are poised to question whether or not these single men need a wife, or if the need is dictated by the ""neighbourhood"" families and their daughters who require a ""good fortune"". According toAmerican Book Reviewthe opening line of Pride and Prejudice is considered second on their list of top 100 greatest opening lines in English literature afterMoby Dick's  ""Call me Ishmael"".[16]Marriage is a complex social activity that takes political and financial economy into account. In the case of Charlotte Lucas, the seeming success of her marriage lies in the comfortable financial circumstances of their household, while the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet serves to illustrate bad marriages based on an initial attraction and surface over substance (economic and psychological).The Bennets' marriage is an example that the youngest Bennet, Lydia, re-enacts with Wickham and the results are far from felicitous. Although the central characters, Elizabeth and Darcy, begin the novel as hostile acquaintances and unlikely friends, they eventually work toward a better understanding of themselves and each other, which frees them to truly fall in love. This does not eliminate the challenges of the real differences in their technically equivalent social status as gentry and their female relations. It does however provide them with a better understanding of each other's point of view from the different ends of the rather wide scale of differences within that category.When Elizabeth rejects Darcy's first proposal, the argument of marrying for love is introduced. Elizabeth accepts Darcy's proposal only when she is certain she loves him and her feelings are reciprocated.[17]Austen's complex sketching of different marriages ultimately allows readers to question what forms of alliance are desirable especially when it comes to privileging economic, sexual, or companionate attraction.[18]Wealth[edit]Money plays a fundamental role in the marriage market, for the young ladies seeking a well-off husband and for men who wish to marry a woman of means. George Wickham tries to elope with Georgiana Darcy, and Colonel Fitzwilliam states that he will marry someone with wealth.Marrying a woman of a rich family also ensured a linkage to a higher-class family, as is visible in the desires of Bingley's sisters to have their brother married to Georgiana Darcy. Mrs. Bennet is frequently seen encouraging her daughters to marry a wealthy man of high social class. In chapter 1, when Mr. Bingley arrives, she declares ""I am thinking of his marrying one of them"".[19]Inheritance was by descent but could be further restricted byentailment, which in the case of the Longbourn estate restricted inheritance to male heirs only. In the case of the Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death in the absence of any closer male heirs, and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her security; but she refuses his offer.Inheritance laws benefited males because married women did not have independent legal rights until the second half of the 19th century. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and the children she was to have.[20]The irony of the opening line is that generally within this society it would be a woman who would be looking for a wealthy husband to have a prosperous life.[21]Class[edit]Lady Catherine and Elizabeth byC. E. Brock, 1895Lady Catherine confronts Elizabeth aboutDarcy, on the title page of the first illustrated edition. This is the other of the first two illustrations of the novel.Austen might be known now for her ""romances"" but the marriages in her novels engage with economics and class distinction.Pride and Prejudiceis hardly the exception.When Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, he cites their economic and social differences as an obstacle his excessive love has had to overcome, though he still anxiously harps on the problems it poses for him within his social circle. His aunt, Lady Catherine, later characterises these differences in particularly harsh terms when she conveys what Elizabeth's marriage to Darcy will become, ""Will the shades of Pemberley be thus polluted?"" Although Elizabeth responds to Lady Catherine's accusations that hers is a potentially contaminating economic and social position (Elizabeth even insists she and Darcy, as gentleman's daughter and gentleman, are ""equals""), Lady Catherine refuses to accept the possibility of Darcy's marriage to Elizabeth. However, as the novel closes, ""...through curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself"", Lady Catherine condescends to visit them at Pemberley.[22]The Bingleys present a particular problem for navigating class. Though Caroline Bingley and Mrs. Hurst behave and speak of others as if they have always belonged in the upper echelons of society, Austen makes it clear that the Bingley fortunes stem from trade. The fact that Bingley rents Netherfield Hall – it is, after all, ""to let"" – distinguishes him significantly from Darcy, whose estate belonged to his father's family and who through his mother is the grandson and nephew of anearl. Bingley, unlike Darcy, does not own his property but has portable and growing wealth that makes him a good catch on the marriage market for poorer daughters of the gentry, like Jane Bennet, or of ambitious merchants. Class plays a central role in the evolution of the characters and Jane Austen's radical approach to class is seen as the plot unfolds.[23]An undercurrent of the oldAnglo-Normanupper class is hinted at in the story, as suggested by the names of Fitzwilliam Darcy and his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh;Fitzwilliam,D'Arcy,de Bourgh(Burke), and evenBennet, are traditional Norman surnames.[24]Self-knowledge[edit]Through their interactions and their critiques of each other, Darcy and Elizabeth come to recognise their faults and work to correct them. Elizabeth meditates on her own mistakes thoroughly in chapter 36:""How despicably have I acted!"" she cried; ""I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust. How humiliating is this discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.""[25]Other characters rarely exhibit this depth of understanding or at least are not given the space within the novel for this sort of development.Tanner writes that Mrs. Bennet in particular, ""has a very limited view of the requirements of that performance; lacking any introspective tendencies she is incapable of appreciating the feelings of others and is only aware of material objects"".[26]Mrs Bennet's behaviour reflects the society in which she lives, as she knows that her daughters will not succeed if they do not get married. ""The business of her life was to get her daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.""[27]This shows that Mrs. Bennet is only aware of ""material objects"" and not of her feelings and emotions.[28]A notable exception is Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth Bennet's close friend and confidant. She accepts Mr. Collins's proposal of marriage once Lizzie rejects him, not out of sentiment but acute awareness of her circumstances as ""one of a large family"". Charlotte's decision is reflective of her prudent nature and awareness.Style[edit]Pride and Prejudice, like most of Austen's works, employs the narrative technique offree indirect speech, which has been defined as ""the free representation of a character's speech, by which one means, not words actually spoken by a character, but the words that typify the character's thoughts, or the way the character would think or speak, if she thought or spoke"".[29]Austen creates her characters with fully developed personalities and unique voices. Though Darcy and Elizabeth are very alike, they are also considerably different.[30]By using narrative that adopts the tone and vocabulary of a particular character (in this case, Elizabeth), Austen invites the reader to follow events from Elizabeth's viewpoint, sharing her prejudices and misapprehensions. ""The learning curve, while undergone by both protagonists, is disclosed to us solely through Elizabeth's point of view and her free indirect speech is essential ... for it is through it that we remain caught, if not stuck, within Elizabeth's misprisions.""[29]The few times the reader is allowed to gain further knowledge of another character's feelings, is through the letters exchanged in this novel. Darcy's first letter to Elizabeth is an example of this as through his letter, the reader and Elizabeth are both given knowledge of Wickham's true character.Austen is known to use irony throughout the novel especially from viewpoint of the character of Elizabeth Bennet. She conveys the ""oppressive rules of femininity that actually dominate her life and work, and are covered by her beautifully carved trojan horse of ironic distance.""[5]Beginning with a historical investigation of the development of a particular literary form and then transitioning into empirical verifications, it reveals free indirect discourse as a tool that emerged over time as practical means for addressing the physical distinctness of minds. Seen in this way, free indirect discourse is a distinctly literary response to an environmental concern, providing a scientific justification that does not reduce literature to a mechanical extension of biology, but takes its value to be its own original form.[31]Development of the novel[edit]Page 2 of a letter fromJane Austento her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first mentionsPride and Prejudice, using its working titleFirst Impressions.Austen began writing the novel after staying atGoodnestone Parkin Kent with her brother Edward and his wife in 1796.[32]It was originally titledFirst Impressions, and was written between October 1796 and August 1797.[33]On 1 November 1797 Austen's father sent a letter to London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask if he had any interest in seeing the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return post.[34]The militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several times.[35]: 57The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment leaves in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August 1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and 1795.[35]: 56–57Austen made significant revisions to the manuscript forFirst Impressionsbetween 1811 and 1812.[33]As nothing remains of the original manuscript, study of the first drafts of the novel is reduced to conjecture. From the large number of letters in the final novel, it is assumed thatFirst Impressionswas anepistolary novel.[36]She later renamed the storyPride and Prejudicearound 1811/1812, when she sold the rights to publish the manuscript toThomas Egertonfor £110[37](equivalent to £9,300 in 2023). In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in mind the ""sufferings and oppositions"" summarised in the final chapter ofFanny Burney'sCecilia, called ""Pride and Prejudice"", where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.[12]It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works. In the years between the completion ofFirst Impressionsand its revision intoPride and Prejudice, two other works had been published under that name: a novel byMargaret Holfordand a comedy byHorace Smith.[34]Publication history[edit]Title page of a 1907 edition illustrated byC. E. BrockAusten sold the copyright for the novel to Thomas Egerton from the Military Library, Whitehall in exchange for £110 (Austen had asked for £150).[38]This proved a costly decision. Austen had publishedSense and Sensibilityon acommissionbasis, whereby sheindemnifiedthe publisher against any losses and received any profits, less costs and the publisher's commission. Unaware thatSense and Sensibilitywould sell out its edition, making her £140,[34]she passed the copyright to Egerton for a one-off payment, meaning that all the risk (and all the profits) would be his. Jan Fergus has calculated that Egerton subsequently made around £450 from just the first two editions of the book.[39]Egerton published the first edition ofPride and Prejudicein three hardcover volumes on 28 January 1813.[40]It was advertised inThe Morning Chronicle, priced at 18s.[33]Favourable reviews saw this edition sold out, with a second edition published in October that year. A third edition was published in 1817.[38]Foreign language translations first appeared in 1813 in French; subsequent translations were published in German, Danish, and Swedish.[41]Pride and Prejudicewas first published in the United States in August 1832 asElizabeth Bennet or, Pride and Prejudice.[38]The novel was also included inRichard Bentley's Standard Novel series in 1833. R. W. Chapman's scholarly edition ofPride and Prejudice, first published in 1923, has become the standard edition on which many modern published versions of the novel are based.[38]The novel was originally published anonymously, as were all of Austen's novels. However, whereas her first published novel,Sense and Sensibilitywas presented as being written ""by a Lady,""Pride and Prejudicewas attributed to ""the Author ofSense and Sensibility"". This began to consolidate a conception of Austen as an author, albeit anonymously. Her subsequent novels were similarly attributed to the anonymous author of all her then-published works.Reception[edit]Main article:Reception history of Jane Austen19th century[edit]The novel was well received, with three favourable reviews in the first months following publication.[39]Anne Isabella Milbanke, later to be the wife ofLord Byron, called it ""the fashionable novel"".[39]Noted critic and reviewerGeorge Henry Lewesdeclared that he ""would rather have writtenPride and Prejudice, orTom Jones, than any of theWaverley Novels"".[42]Throughout the 19th century, not all reviews of the work were positive.Charlotte Brontë, in a letter to Lewes, wrote thatPride and Prejudicewas a disappointment, ""a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but [...] no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck"".[42][43]Along with her,Mark Twainwas overwhelmingly negative of the work. He stated, ""Everytime I readPride and PrejudiceI want to dig [Austen] up and beat her over the skull with her own shin-bone.""[44]Austen for her part thought the ""playfulness and epigrammaticism"" ofPride and Prejudicewas excessive, complaining in a letter to her sister Cassandra in 1813 that the novel lacked ""shade"" and should have had a chapter ""of solemn specious nonsense, about something unconnected with the story; an essay on writing, a critique on Walter Scott or the history of Buonaparté"".[45]Walter Scottwrote in his journal, ""Read again and for the third time at least, Miss Austen's very finely written novel ofPride and Prejudice.""[46]20th century[edit]You could not shock her more than she shocks me,Beside herJoyceseems innocent as grass.It makes me most uncomfortable to seeAn English spinster of the middle classDescribe the amorous effects of 'brass',Reveal so frankly and with such sobrietyThe economic basis of society.W. H. Auden(1937) on Austen[42]The American scholarClaudia L. Johnsondefended the novel from the criticism that it has an unrealistic fairy-tale quality.[47]One critic,Mary Poovey, wrote that the ""romantic conclusion"" ofPride and Prejudiceis an attempt to hedge the conflict between the ""individualistic perspective inherent in the bourgeois value systemandthe authoritarian hierarchy retained from traditional, paternalistic society"".[47]Johnson wrote that Austen's view of a power structure capable of reformation was not an ""escape"" from conflict.[47]Johnson wrote the ""outrageous unconventionality"" of Elizabeth Bennet was in Austen's own time very daring, especially given the strict censorship that was imposed in Britain by the Prime Minister, William Pitt, in the 1790s when Austen wrotePride and Prejudice.[47]In the early twentieth century, the term ""Collins,"" named for Austen'sWilliam Collins, came into use as slang for a thank-you note to a host.[48][49]21st century[edit]In 2003 the BBC conducted a poll for the ""UK's Best-Loved Book"" in whichPride and Prejudicecame second, behindThe Lord of the Rings.[50]In a 2008 survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers,Pride and Prejudicecame first in a list of the 101 best books ever written.[51]The 200th anniversary ofPride and Prejudiceon 28 January 2013 was celebrated around the globe by media networks such as theHuffington Post,The New York Times, andThe Daily Telegraph, among others.[52][53][54][55][56][57][58]Adaptations[edit]Film, television and theatre[edit]See also:Jane Austen in popular culture – Pride and PrejudiceNumerous screen adaptations have contributed in popularisingPride and Prejudice.[59]The first television adaptation of the novel, written byMichael Barry, was produced in 1938 by theBBC.

Books,The_Great_Gatsby,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Gatsby,The Great Gatsby,"1925 novel by F. Scott FitzgeraldThis article is about the novel. For other uses, seeThe Great Gatsby (disambiguation).The Great GatsbyThe front dust jacket art of the first edition, known asCelestial EyesAuthorF. Scott FitzgeraldCover artistFrancis CugatLanguageEnglishGenreTragedyPublishedApril 10, 1925PublisherCharles Scribner's SonsPublication placeUnited StatesMedia typePrint (hardcover&paperback)Preceded byThe Beautiful and Damned(1922)Followed byTender Is the Night(1934)TextThe Great GatsbyatWikisourceThe Great Gatsby(/ɡætsbiː/ⓘ) is a 1925novelby American writerF. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in theJazz AgeonLong Island, near New York City, the novel depictsfirst-personnarratorNick Carraway's interactions withJay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire obsessed with reuniting with his former lover,Daisy Buchanan.The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had withsocialiteGinevra Kingand the riotous parties he attended on Long Island'sNorth Shorein 1922. Following a move to theFrench Riviera, Fitzgerald completed a rough draft of the novel in 1924. He submitted it to editorMaxwell Perkins, who persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. After making revisions, Fitzgerald was satisfied with the text but remained ambivalent about the book's title and considered several alternatives. PainterFrancis Cugat's dust jacket art, namedCelestial Eyes, greatly impressed Fitzgerald, and he incorporated its imagery into the novel.After its publication byScribner'sin April 1925,The Great Gatsbyreceived generally favorable reviews, though some literary critics believed it did not equal Fitzgerald's previous efforts. Compared to his earlier novels,This Side of Paradise(1920) andThe Beautiful and Damned(1922), the novel was a commercial disappointment. It sold fewer than 20,000 copies by October, and Fitzgerald's hopes of a monetary windfall from the novel were unrealized. When the author died in 1940, he believed himself to be a failure and his work forgotten.DuringWorld War II, the novel experienced an abrupt surge in popularity when theCouncil on Books in Wartimedistributed free copies to American soldiers serving overseas. This new-found popularity launched a critical and scholarly re-examination, and the work soon became a core part of most American high school curricula and a part of American popular culture. Numerous stage and film adaptations followed in the subsequent decades.Gatsbycontinues to attract popular and scholarly attention. Scholars emphasize the novel's treatment ofsocial class,inheritedversusself-made wealth,gender,race, andenvironmentalism, as well as its cynical attitude towards theAmerican Dream.The Great Gatsbyis widely considered to be a literarymasterworkand a contender for the title of theGreat American Novel.Historical and biographical context[edit]Further information:Jazz AgeandProhibition in the United StatesF. Scott Fitzgerald's romance and life-long obsession with socialiteGinevra Kinginformed the plot of the novel. King was fêted in the press as amongChicago's most desirable debutantesand inspired the character of Daisy Buchanan.Set on the prosperous Long Island of 1922,The Great Gatsbyprovides a critical social history ofProhibition-era Americaduring the Jazz Age.[a]F. Scott Fitzgerald's fictional narrative fully renders that period—known for itsjazzmusic,[2]economic prosperity,[3]flapperculture,[4]libertinemores,[3]rebellious youth,[5]and ubiquitousspeakeasies. Fitzgerald uses many of these 1920s societal developments to tell his story, from simple details likepettingin automobiles to broader themes such asbootleggingas the illicit source of Gatsby's fortune.[6][7]Fitzgerald conveys thehedonismof Jazz Age society by following a down-to-earth narrator as a spectator of the flashiest and most raucous era in American history.[3][8]In Fitzgerald's eyes, the era represented a morally permissive time when Americans of all ages became disillusioned with prevailingsocial normsand obsessed with pleasure-seeking.[9]Fitzgerald himself had a certain ambivalence towards the Jazz Age, an era whose themes he would later regard as reflective of events in his own life.[10]The Great Gatsbyreflects various events in Fitzgerald's youth.[11]He was a young Midwesterner fromMinnesota. Like the novel's narrator who went toYale, he was educated at anIvy Leagueschool,Princeton.[12]There the 18-year-old Fitzgerald metGinevra King, a 16-year-old socialite with whom he fell deeply in love.[13][14]Although Ginevra was madly in love with him,[15]her upper-class family openly discouraged his courtship of their daughter because of his lower-class status, and her father purportedly told him that ""poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls"".[16]Rejected by Ginevra's family as a suitor because of his lack of financial prospects, a suicidal Fitzgerald enlisted in theUnited States ArmyamidWorld War Iand was commissioned as asecond lieutenant.[17][18]While awaiting deployment to theWestern frontwhere he hoped to die in combat,[18]he was stationed atCamp SheridaninMontgomery, Alabama, where he metZelda Sayre, a vivacious 17-year-oldSouthern belle.[19]After learning that Ginevra had married wealthy Chicago businessman William ""Bill"" Mitchell, Fitzgerald asked Zelda to marry him.[20]Zelda agreed but postponed their marriage until he became financially successful.[21][22]Fitzgerald is thus similar to Jay Gatsby in that he became engaged while a military officer stationed far from home and then sought immense wealth in order to provide for the lifestyle to which his fiancée had become accustomed.[b][26][27]After his success as a short-story writer and as a novelist, Fitzgerald married Zelda in New York City, and the newly-wed couple soon relocated to Long Island.[28]Despite enjoying the exclusive Long Island milieu, Fitzgerald quietly disapproved of the extravagant parties,[29]and the wealthy persons he encountered often disappointed him.[30]While striving to emulate the rich, he found their privileged lifestyle to be morally disquieting.[31][32]Although Fitzgerald—like Gatsby—had always admired the rich, he nonetheless possessed a smoldering resentment towards them.[32]Plot summary[edit]George Wilson and his wife Myrtle live in the ""valley of ashes"", arefuse dump(shown in the above photograph) historically located in New York City during the 1920s. Today, the area isFlushing Meadows–Corona Park.In spring 1922,Nick Carraway—a Yale alumnus from theMidwestand a World War I veteran—journeys toNew York Cityto obtain employment as abond salesman. He rents abungalowin theLong Islandvillage of West Egg, next to a luxurious estate inhabited byJay Gatsby, an enigmatic multi-millionaire who hosts dazzling soirées yet does not partake in them.One evening, Nick dines with a distant cousin,Daisy Buchanan, in the old money town of East Egg. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, formerly a Yale football star whom Nick knew during his college days. The couple has recently relocated fromChicagoto a mansion directly across the bay from Gatsby's estate. There, Nick encounters Jordan Baker, an insolent flapper and golf champion who is a childhood friend of Daisy's. Jordan confides to Nick that Tom keeps a mistress, who brazenly telephones him at his home and lives in the ""valley of ashes"", a sprawling refuse dump.[33]That evening, Nick sees Gatsby standing alone on his lawn, staring at a green light across the bay.The confrontation between Gatsby and Tom occurs in the twenty-storyPlaza Hotel, achâteau-like edifice with an architectural style inspired by theFrench Renaissance.Days later, Nick reluctantly accompanies a drunken and agitated Tom to New York City by train. En route, they stop at a garage inhabited by mechanic George Wilson and his wife—and Tom's mistress—Myrtle. Myrtle joins them, and the trio proceeds to a small New York apartment that Tom has rented for trysts with her. Guests arrive and a party ensues, which ends with Tom slapping Myrtle and breaking her nose after she mentions Daisy.One morning, Nick receives a formal invitation to a party at Gatsby's mansion. Once there, Nick is embarrassed that he recognizes no one and begins drinking heavily until he encounters Jordan. While chatting with her, he is approached by a man who introduces himself as Jay Gatsby and insists that both he and Nick served in the3rd Infantry Division[c]during the war. Gatsby attempts to ingratiate himself with Nick and when Nick leaves the party, he notices Gatsby watching him.In late July, Nick and Gatsby have lunch at aspeakeasy. Gatsby tries impressing Nick with tales of his war heroism and hisOxforddays. Afterward, Nick meets Jordan again at thePlaza Hotel.

Gatsby uses Nick to stage a reunion with Daisy, and the two embark upon an affair.In September, Tom discovers the affair when Daisy carelessly addresses Gatsby with unabashed intimacy in front of him. Later, at a Plaza Hotel suite, Gatsby and Tom argue about the affair. Gatsby insists Daisy declare that she never loved Tom. Daisy claims she loves Tom and Gatsby, upsetting both. Tom reveals Gatsby is a swindler whose money comes from bootlegging alcohol. Upon hearing this, Daisy chooses to stay with Tom. Tom scornfully tells Gatsby to drive her home, knowing that Daisy will never leave him.While returning to East Egg, Gatsby and Daisy drive by Wilson's garage and their car strikes Myrtle, killing her instantly. Later Gatsby reveals to Nick that Daisy was driving the car, but that he intends to take the blame for the accident to protect her. Nick urges Gatsby to flee to avoid prosecution, but he refuses. After Tom tells George that Gatsby owns the car that struck Myrtle, a distraught George assumes the owner of the vehicle must be Myrtle's lover. George fatally shoots Gatsby in his mansion's swimming pool, then kills himself.Several days after Gatsby's murder, his father Henry Gatz arrives for the sparsely attended funeral. After Gatsby's death, Nick comes to hate New York and decides that Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and he were all Midwesterners unsuited toEastern life.[d]Nick encounters Tom and initially refuses to shake his hand. Tom admits he was the one who told George that Gatsby owned the vehicle that killed Myrtle. Before returning to the Midwest, Nick returns to Gatsby's mansion and stares across the bay at the green light emanating from the end of Daisy's dock.Major characters[edit]Edith Cummings, a premieramateur golfer, inspired the character of Jordan Baker. A friend of Ginevra King, she was one ofChicago's famous debutantesin the Jazz Age.Nick Carraway– a Yale University alumnus from the Midwest, a WorldWar Iveteran, and a newly arrived resident of West Egg, age 29 (later 30) who serves as thefirst-person narrator. He is Gatsby's neighbor and a bond salesman. Nick is easy-going and optimistic, although this latter quality fades as the novel progresses. He ultimately returns to the Midwest after despairing of the decadence and indifference of the eastern United States.[35]Jay Gatsby(originallyJames ""Jimmy"" Gatz) – a young, mysterious millionaire with shady business connections (later revealed to be a bootlegger), originally fromNorth Dakota. During WorldWar I, when he was a youngmilitary officerstationed at the United States Army'sCamp Taylorin Louisville, Kentucky, Gatsby encountered the love of his life, thedebutanteDaisy Buchanan. Later, after the war, he studied briefly atTrinity College, Oxford, in England.[36]According to Fitzgerald's wife Zelda, he partly based Gatsby on their enigmatic Long Island neighbor,Max Gerlach.[37]A military veteran, Gerlach became a self-made millionaire due to his bootlegging endeavors and was fond of using the phrase ""old sport"" in his letters to Fitzgerald.[38]Daisy Buchanan– a shallow, self-absorbed, and young debutante andsocialitefromLouisville, Kentucky, identified as a flapper.[39]She is Nick's second cousin, once removed, and the wife of Tom Buchanan. Before marrying Tom, Daisy had a romantic relationship with Gatsby. Her choice between Gatsby and Tom is one of the novel's central conflicts. Fitzgerald's romance and life-long obsession withGinevra Kinginspired the character of Daisy.[13][40][41]Thomas ""Tom"" Buchanan– Daisy's husband, a millionaire who lives in East Egg. Tom is an imposing man of muscular build with a gruff voice and contemptuous demeanor.[42]He was a football star at Yale and is awhite supremacist.[43]Among other literary models,[e]Tom has certain parallels with William ""Bill"" Mitchell, the Chicago businessman who married Ginevra King.[45]Tom and Mitchell were both Chicagoans with an interest inpolo.[45]Also, like Ginevra's father Charles King, whom Fitzgerald resented, Tom is an imperious Yale man and polo player fromLake Forest, Illinois.[46]Jordan Baker– an amateur golfer with a sarcastic streak and an aloof attitude, and Daisy's long-time friend. She is Nick Carraway's girlfriend for most of the novel, though they grow apart towards the end. She has a shady reputation because of rumors that she had cheated in a tournament, which harmed her reputation both socially and as a golfer. Fitzgerald based Jordan on Ginevra's friendEdith Cummings,[47]a premier amateur golfer known in the press as ""The Fairway Flapper"".[48]Unlike Jordan Baker, Cummings was never suspected of cheating.[49]The character's name is a play on two popular automobile brands, theJordan Motor Car Companyand theBaker Motor Vehicle, both ofCleveland, Ohio,[50]alluding to Jordan's ""fast"" reputation and the new freedom presented to American women, especially flappers, in the 1920s.[51][52][53]Myrtle Wilson– George B. Wilson's wife and Tom Buchanan's mistress. Myrtle, who possesses a fierce vitality,[54]is desperate to find refuge from her disappointing marriage.[55]She is accidentally killed by Gatsby's car, as she mistakenly thinks Tom is still driving it and runs after it.[56]George B. Wilson– a mechanic and owner of a garage. He is disliked by both his wife, Myrtle, and Tom Buchanan, who describes him as ""so dumb he doesn't know he's alive"".[57]At the end of the novel, George shoots Gatsby dead, wrongly believing he had been driving the car that killed Myrtle, and then kills himself.[58]Writing and production[edit]The now-demolishedBeacon Towerspartly served as an inspiration for Gatsby's home.Oheka Castlewas another North Shore inspiration for the novel's setting.Fitzgerald began outlining his third novel in June 1922.[7]He longed to produce an exquisite work that was beautiful and intricately patterned,[59]but the troubled production of hisstage playThe Vegetablerepeatedly interrupted his progress.[60]The play flopped, and Fitzgerald wrote magazine stories that winter to pay debts incurred by its production.[61]He viewed these stories as all worthless,[60]although included among them was ""Winter Dreams"", which Fitzgerald described as his first attempt at the Gatsby idea.[62]""The whole idea of Gatsby"", he later explained to a friend, ""is the unfairness of a poor young man not being able to marry a girl with money. This theme comes up again and again because I lived it"".[63]In October 1922, after the birth of their only child,Frances Scott ""Scottie"" Fitzgerald, the Fitzgeralds moved toGreat Neck, New York, on Long Island.[64]Their neighbors in Great Neck included such newly wealthy personages as writerRing Lardner, actorLew Fieldsand comedianEd Wynn.[7]These figures were all considered to benouveau riche, unlike those who came fromManhasset Neck, which sat across the bay from Great Neck—places that were home to many of New York's wealthiest established families.[65]This real-life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for ""West Egg"" and ""East Egg"". In the novel, Great Neck (Kings Point) became the ""new money"" peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington (Sands Point) became the ""old money"" East Egg.[65]SeveralGold Coast mansionsin the area served as inspiration for Gatsby's estate including Land's End,[66]Oheka Castle,[67]and the since-demolishedBeacon Towers.[68]While living on Long Island, the Fitzgeralds' enigmatic neighbor wasMax Gerlach.[f][37][72]Purportedly born in America to a German immigrant family,[g]Gerlach had been a major in the American Expeditionary Forces during WorldWar I, and he later became a gentleman bootlegger who lived like a millionaire in New York.[74]Flaunting his new wealth,[h]Gerlach threw lavish parties,[76]never wore the same shirt twice,[77]used the phrase ""old sport"",[78]and fostered myths about himself including that he was a relation of theGerman Kaiser.[79]These details about Gerlach inspired Fitzgerald in his creation ofJay Gatsby.[80]During this same time period, the daily newspapers sensationalized theHall–Mills murder caseover many months, and the highly publicized case likely influenced the plot of Fitzgerald's novel.[81]The case involved the double-murder of a man and his lover on September 14, 1922, mere weeks before Fitzgerald arrived in Great Neck. Scholars have speculated that Fitzgerald based certain aspects of the ending ofThe Great Gatsbyand various characterizations on this factual incident.[82]Inspired by the Halls–Mills case, the mysterious persona of Gerlach and the riotous parties he attended on Long Island, Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel by mid-1923 but discarded most of his new story as a false start.[83]Some of this early draft resurfaced in the 1924 short story ""Absolution"".[84]In earlier drafts,[i]Daisy was originally named Ada and Nick was Dud,[86]and the two characters had shared a previous romance prior to their reunion on Long Island.[87]These earlier drafts were written from the viewpoint of an omniscient narrator as opposed to Nick's perspective.[88]A key difference in earlier drafts is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream.[89]Another difference is that the argument between Tom Buchanan and Gatsby is more balanced, although Daisy still returns to Tom.[89]Work onThe Great Gatsbyresumed in earnest in April 1924.[90]Fitzgerald decided to depart from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that he was intent on creating an artistic achievement.[91]He wished to eschew the realism of his previous two novels and to compose a creative work of sustained imagination.[92]To this end, he consciously imitated the literary styles ofJoseph ConradandWilla Cather.[93]He was particularly influenced by Cather's 1923 work,A Lost Lady,[94]which features a wealthy married socialite pursued by a variety of romantic suitors and who symbolically embodies the American dream.[95][96]He later wrote a letter to Cather apologizing for any unintentional plagiarism.[94]During this period of revisions, Scott saw and was influenced by early sketches for the book's dust jacket art.[97][98]Soon after this burst of effort, work slowed while the Fitzgeralds moved to the Villa Marie in Saint-Raphaël on theFrench Riviera, where a marital crisis soon developed.[j]Despite his ongoing marital tension, Fitzgerald continued to write steadily and submitted a near-final version of the manuscript to his editor,Maxwell Perkins, on October 27.[100]Perkins informed him in a November letter that Gatsby was too vague as a character and that his wealth and business, respectively, needed a convincing explanation.[101]Fitzgerald thanked Perkins for his detailed criticisms and claimed that such feedback would enable him to perfect the manuscript.[102]Having relocated with his wife to Rome,[103]Fitzgerald made revisions to the manuscript throughout the winter.[101]Content after a few rounds of revision, Fitzgerald submitted the final version in February 1925.[104]Fitzgerald's alterations included extensive revisions of the sixth and eighth chapters.[105]He declined an offer of $10,000 for theserial rightsto the book so that it could be published sooner.[106]He received a $3,939 advance in 1923 and would receive $1,981.25 upon publication.[107]Alternative titles[edit]Fitzgerald's editor,Maxwell Perkins, convinced the author to abandon his original title ofTrimalchio in West Eggin favor ofThe Great Gatsby.Fitzgerald had difficulty choosing a title for his novel and entertained many choices before reluctantly deciding onThe Great Gatsby,[108]a title inspired byAlain-Fournier'sLe Grand Meaulnes.[109]Previously he had shifted betweenAmong Ash Heaps and Millionaires,[108]Trimalchio,[108]Trimalchio in West Egg,[110]On the Road to West Egg,[110]Under the Red, White, and Blue,[108]The Gold-Hatted Gatsby,[110]andThe High-Bouncing Lover.[110]The titlesThe Gold-Hatted GatsbyandThe High-Bouncing Lovercame from Fitzgerald'sepigraphfor the novel, one which he wrote himself under the pen name ofThomas Parke D'Invilliers.[111]Fitzgerald initially preferred titles referencingTrimalchio,[k]the crude upstart inPetronius'sSatyricon, and even refers to Gatsby as Trimalchio once in the novel.[113]Unlike Gatsby's spectacular parties, Trimalchio participated in the orgies he hosted but, according to literary criticTony Tanner, there are subtle similarities between the two characters.[114]By November 1924, Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins that he had settled upon the title ofTrimalchio in West Egg.[115]Disliking Fitzgerald's chosen title ofTrimalchio in West Egg, editor Max Perkins persuaded him that the reference was too obscure and that people would be unable to pronounce it.[116]Zelda and Perkins both expressed their preference forThe Great Gatsby, and the next month Fitzgerald agreed.[117]A month before publication, after a final review of the proofs, he asked if it would be possible to re-title itTrimalchioorGold-Hatted Gatsby, but Perkins advised against it. On March 19, 1925,[118]Fitzgerald expressed enthusiasm for the titleUnder the Red, White, and Blue, but it was too late to change it at that stage.[119][120]The novel was published asThe Great Gatsbyon April 10, 1925.[121]Fitzgerald believed the book's final title to be merely acceptable and often expressed his ambivalence with the name.[122]Dust jacket art[edit]Further information:Celestial EyesDrafts of the dust jacket by artistFrancis Cugatjuxtaposed with the final version. In one draft (first), a single eye loomed overLong Island Sound. In a subsequent draft (second), Cugat expanded upon this concept to feature two eyes gazing over the New York cityscape. In the final draft (third), the shadowy cityscape was replaced by carnival lights evokingConey Island.The artwork for the first edition ofThe Great Gatsby,known asCelestial Eyes,is among the most celebrated in American literature and represents a unique instance in literary history in which a novel's commissioned artwork directly influenced the composition of the text.[123]Rendered in anArt Decovisual style,[124]the artwork depicts the disembodied face of a Jazz Age flapper with celestial eyes and rouged mouth over a dark blue skyline.[125]A little-knownBarcelonanpainter namedFrancis Cugat—born Francisco Coradal-Cougat—was commissioned by an unknown individual in Scribner's art department to illustrate the cover while Fitzgerald was composing the novel.[126]In a preliminary sketch, Cugat drew a concept of a dismal gray landscape inspired by Fitzgerald's original title for the novel,Among Ash Heaps and Millionaires.[127]Discarding this gloomy concept, Cugat next drew a divergent study which became the prefiguration to the final cover: A pencil and crayon drawing of a flapper's half-hidden visage over Long Island Sound with scarlet lips, one celestial eye, and a single diagonal tear.[128]Expanding upon this study, his subsequent drawing featured two bright eyes looming over a shadowy New York cityscape.[129]In later iterations, Cugat replaced the shadowy cityscape with dazzling carnival lights evoking aFerris wheeland likely referencing the glittering amusement park at New York'sConey Island.[130]Cugat affixed reclining nudes within the flapper's irises and added a green tint to the streaming tear.[131]Cugat's final cover,[l]which Max Perkins hailed as a masterpiece, was the only work he completed for Scribner's and the only book cover he ever designed.[133]Although Fitzgerald likely never saw the finalgouachepainting prior to the novel's publication,[134]Cugat's preparatory drafts influenced his writing.[97][124]Upon viewing Cugat's drafts before sailing for France in April–May 1924,[97][98]Fitzgerald was so enamored that he later told editor Max Perkins that he had incorporated Cugat's imagery into the novel.[135]This statement has led many to analyze interrelations between Cugat's art and Fitzgerald's text.[135]One popular interpretation is that the celestial eyes are reminiscent of those of optometrist T. J. Eckleburg depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop.[136]AuthorErnest Hemingwaysupported this latter interpretation and claimed that Fitzgerald had told him the cover referred to a billboard in the valley of the ashes.[137]Although this passage has some resemblance to the imagery, a closer explanation can be found in Fitzgerald's explicit description of Daisy Buchanan as the ""girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs"".[126]Critical reception[edit]Initial reviews[edit]Charles Scribner's SonspublishedThe Great Gatsbyon April 10, 1925.[138]Fitzgerald cabled Perkins the day after publication to monitor reviews: ""Any news?""[138]""Sales situation doubtful [but] excellent reviews"", read a telegram from Perkins on April 20.[139]Fitzgerald responded on April 24, saying the cable dispirited him, closing the letter with ""Yours in great depression"".[139]Fitzgerald soon received letters from contemporariesWilla Cather,Edith Wharton, and poetT. S. Eliotpraising the novel.[140]Although gratified by such correspondence, Fitzgerald sought public acclaim from professional critics.[141]Although he praised the novel's style,H. L. Menckencriticized the plot as highly improbable—a criticism that Fitzgerald particularly resented.The Great Gatsbyreceived generally favorable reviews from literary critics of the day.[142]Edwin Clark ofThe New York Timesfelt the novel was a mystical and glamorous tale of the Jazz Age.[143]Similarly, Lillian C. Ford of theLos Angeles Timeshailed the novel as a revelatory work of art that ""leaves the reader in a mood of chastened wonder"".[144]TheNew York Postdescribed Fitzgerald's prose style as scintillating and genuinely brilliant.[145]TheNew York Herald Tribunewas less impressed, referring toThe Great Gatsbyas ""a literary lemon meringue"" that nonetheless ""contains some of the nicest little touches of contemporary observation you could imagine—so light, so delicate, so sharp"".[146]InThe Chicago Daily Tribune,H. L. Menckenjudged the work's plot to be highly improbable, although he praised the writing as elegant and the ""careful and brilliant finish"".[147]Several reviewers felt the novel left much to be desired following Fitzgerald's previous works and criticized him accordingly. Harvey Eagleton ofThe Dallas Morning Newspredicted that the novel signaled the end of Fitzgerald's artistic success.[148]Ralph Coghlan of theSt. Louis Post-Dispatchdismissed the work as an inconsequential performance by a once-promising author who had grown bored and cynical.[149]Ruth Snyder ofNew York Evening Worldlambasted the book's style as painfully forced and declared the editors of her newspaper were ""quite convinced after readingThe Great Gatsbythat Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of today"".[150]John McClure ofThe Times-Picayuneinsisted the plot was implausible and the book itself seemed raw in its construction.[151]After reading these reviews, Fitzgerald believed that many critics misunderstood the novel.[91]He despaired that ""of all the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about"".[152]In particular, Fitzgerald resented criticisms of the novel's plot as implausible since he had never intended for the story to be realistic.[91]Instead, he crafted the work to be a romanticized depiction that was largely scenic and symbolic.[153]According to his friendJohn Peale Bishop, Fitzgerald further resented the fact that critics failed to perceive the many parallels between the author's life and the character of Jay Gatsby; in particular, that both created a mythical version of themselves and attempted to live up to this legend.[154]Dispirited by critics failing to understand the novel, Fitzgerald remained hopeful that the novel would at least be a commercial success, perhaps selling as many as 75,000 copies.[155]To Fitzgerald's great disappointment,Gatsbywas a commercial failure in comparison with his previous efforts,This Side of Paradise(1920) andThe Beautiful and Damned(1922). By October, the book had sold fewer than 20,000 copies.[60]Although the novel went through two initial printings, many copies remained unsold years later.[156]Fitzgerald attributed the poor sales to the fact that women tended to be the primary audience for novels during this time, andGatsbydid not contain an admirable female character.[156]According to his ledger, he earned only $2,000 from the book.[157]AlthoughOwen Davis' 1926 stage adaptation and theParamount-issuedsilent film versionbrought in money for the author, Fitzgerald lamented that the novel fell far short of the success he had hoped for and would not bring him recognition as a serious novelist in the public eye.[60]With the onset of theGreat Depression,The Great Gatsbywas regarded as little more than a nostalgic period piece.[60]By the time Fitzgerald died in 1940, the novel had fallen into near obscurity.[158]Revival and reassessment[edit]Fitzgerald's friendEdmund Wilsonhelped revive the author's posthumous reputation.In 1940, Fitzgerald suffered a third and fatal heart attack and died believing his work forgotten.[159]His obituary inThe New York Timeshailed him as a brilliant novelist and citedGatsbyas his greatest work.[160]In the wake of Fitzgerald's death, a strong appreciation for the book gradually developed in writers' circles. Future authorsBudd SchulbergandEdward Newhousewere deeply affected by it, andJohn O'Haraacknowledged its influence on his work.[161]By the time thatGatsbywas republished inEdmund Wilson's edition ofThe Last Tycoonin 1941, the prevailing opinion in writers' circles deemed the novel to be an enduring work of fiction.[60]In the spring of 1942, mere months after the United States' entrance intoWorld War II, an association of publishing executives created theCouncil on Books in Wartimewith the stated purpose of distributing paperbackArmed Services Editionsbooks tocombat troops.The Great Gatsbywas one of them.[162]Within the next several years, 155,000 copies ofGatsbywere distributed to U.S. soldiers overseas,[163]and the book proved popular among beleaguered troops, according to theSaturday Evening Post's 1945 report.[164]By 1944, a full-scale Fitzgerald revival had occurred.[165]Full-length scholarly articles on Fitzgerald's works were being published inperiodicalsand, by the following year, the earlier consensus among professional critics thatThe Great Gatsbywas merely a sensational story or a nostalgicperiod piecehad effectively vanished.[166]The tireless promotional efforts of literary critic Edmund Wilson, who was Fitzgerald's Princeton classmate and his close friend, led this Fitzgerald revival.[167]In 1951, three years afterZelda's deathin a hospital fire, ProfessorArthur MizenerofCornell UniversitypublishedThe Far Side of Paradise, the first biography of Fitzgerald.[168]Mizener's bestselling biography emphasizedThe Great Gatsby's positive reception by literary critics, which may have further influenced public opinion and renewed interest in it.[169]By 1960—thirty-five years after the novel's original publication—the book was steadily selling 100,000 copies per year.[170]Renewed interest in it ledThe New York Timeseditorialist Mizener to proclaim the novel was amasterworkof 20th-centuryAmerican literature.[60]By 1974,The Great Gatsbyhad attained its status as a literary masterwork and was deemed a contender for the title of the ""Great American Novel"".[171]By the mid-2000s, many literary critics consideredThe Great Gatsbyto be one of the greatest novels ever written,[172]and the work was part of the assigned curricula in the near majority of U.S. high schools.[158]As of early 2020,The Great Gatsbyhad sold almost 30 million copies worldwide and continues to sell an additional 500,000 copies annually.[173]Numerous foreign editions of the novel have been published,[174]and the text has been translated into 42 different languages.[175]The work is Scribner's most popular title; in 2013, thee-bookalone sold 185,000 copies.[175]TheAmerican Library Associationlists the book as among the most challenged classics in U.S. literature.[176]The novel's U.S. copyright expired on January 1, 2021, when all works published in 1925 entered thepublic domain.[177]Since then, numerous altered and incomplete reprints have flooded the market.[178]Critical analysis[edit]Major themes[edit]The American Dream[edit]TheAmerican Dream, often represented by theStatue of Libertysignifying new opportunities in life, is a central theme underlying the novel.Following the novel's revival, later critical writings onThe Great Gatsbyfocused on Fitzgerald's disillusionment with theAmerican Dreamin the hedonistic Jazz Age,[179]a name for the era which Fitzgerald claimed to have coined.[180]In 1970, scholarRoger L. Pearsonasserted that Fitzgerald's work—more so than other twentieth century novels—is especially linked with this conceptualization of the American dream.[181]Pearson traced the literary origins of this dream toColonial America. The dream is the belief that every individual, regardless of their origins, may seek and achieve their desired goals, ""be they political, monetary, or social. It is the literary expression of the concept of America: The land of opportunity"".[181]However, Pearson noted that Fitzgerald's particular treatment of this theme is devoid of the discernible optimism in the writings of earlier American authors.[181]He suggests Gatsby serves as a false prophet of the American dream, and pursuing the dream only results in dissatisfaction for those who chase it, owing to its unattainability.[182]In this analytical context, the green light on the Buchanans' dock (visible acrossLong Island Soundfrom Gatsby's house) is frequently interpreted as a symbol of Gatsby's unrealizable goal to win Daisy and, consequently, to achieve the American Dream.[158][183]Also, scholarSarah Churchwellpoints out that adultery in the novel is linked to the loss of faith and broken promises, which symbolizes the corruption of the American Dream.[184]Class permanence[edit]Scholars and writers commonly ascribe Gatsby's inability to achieve the American Dream to entrenched class disparities in American society.[185]The novel underscores the limits of the American lower class to transcend theirstation of birth.[119]Scholar Sarah Churchwell contends that Fitzgerald's novel is a tale ofclass warfarein a status-obsessed country that refuses to acknowledge publicly it even has a class system.[119]Although scholars posit different explanations for the continuation ofclass differencesin the United States, there is a consensus regarding the novel's message in conveying its underlying permanence.[186]AlthoughGatsby's fundamental conflict occurs between entrenched sources of socio-economic power and upstarts like Gatsby who threaten their interests,[187]Fitzgerald's novel shows that a class permanence persists despite the country's capitalist economy that prizes innovation and adaptability.[187]Dianne Bechtel argues Fitzgerald plotted the novel to illustrate that class transcends wealth in America. Even if the poorer Americans become rich, they remain inferior to those Americans with ""old money"".[188]Consequently, Gatsby and other characters in the novel are trapped in a rigid American class system.[189]Gender relations[edit]An idealized depiction of aflapperas illustrated byEllen Pylefor the cover ofThe Saturday Evening Post(1922)Besides exploring the difficulties of achieving the American dream,The Great Gatsbyexploressocietal gender expectationsduring the Jazz Age.[190]The character of Daisy Buchanan has been identified specifically as personifying the emerging culturalarchetypeof the flapper.[39]Flappers were typically young,modern womenwhobobbed their hairand wore short skirts.[191][192]They also drank alcohol and hadpremarital sex.[193][6]Despite the newfound societal freedoms attained by flappers in the 1920s,[194]Fitzgerald's work critically examines the continued limitations upon women'sagencyduring this period.[195]In this context, although early critics viewed the character of Daisy to be a ""monster ofbitchery"",[196]later scholars such as Leland S. Person Jr. asserted that Daisy's character exemplifies the marginalization of women in the elite social environment that Fitzgerald depicts.[197]Writing in 1978, Person noted Daisy is more of a hapless victim than a manipulative victimizer.[198]She is the target first of Tom's callous domination and next of Gatsby's dehumanizing adoration.[198]She involuntarily becomes theholy grailat the center of Gatsby's unrealistic quest to be steadfast to a youthful concept of himself.[198]The ensuing contest of wills between Tom and Gatsby reduces Daisy to atrophy wifewhose sole existence is to augment her possessor's socio-economic success.[199]As anupper-classwhite woman living in East Egg during this time period, Daisy must adhere to societal expectations andgender normssuch as actively fulfilling the roles of dutiful wife, nurturing mother, and charmingsocialite.[195]Many of Daisy's choices—ultimately culminating in the fatal car crash and misery for all those involved—can be partly attributed to her prescribed role as a ""beautiful little fool"" who is reliant on her husband for financial and societal security.[m][201]Her decision to remain with her husband, despite her feelings for Gatsby, is because of the security that her marriage to Tom Buchanan provides.[196]Race and displacement[edit]Fitzgerald's novel references a fictional book, Goddard'sThe Rise of the Colored Empires, which is a parody ofThe Rising Tide of Color(1920) byLothrop Stoddard.Many scholars have analyzed the novel's treatment of race and displacement; in particular, a perceived threat posed by newer immigrants to older Americans, triggering concerns over a loss ofsocio-economic status.[202]In one instance, Tom Buchanan—the novel's antagonist—claims that he, Nick, and Jordan areracially superior Nordics. Tom decriesimmigrationand advocateswhite supremacy.[203]A fictional book alluded to by Tom is Goddard'sThe Rise of the Colored Empires, which is a parody by Fitzgerald ofLothrop Stoddard'sThe Rising Tide of Color,a 1920sbestseller.[204]Stoddard warned that immigration would alter America's racial composition and destroy the country.[205]Analyzing these elements,literary theoristWalter Benn Michaelscontends that Fitzgerald's novel reflects a historical period in American literature characterized by fears over the influx ofSouthernandEastern Europeanimmigrants whose ""otherness"" challenged Americans' sense ofnational identity.[206]Such anxieties were more salient in national discourse than the societal consequences of World War I,[207][208]and the defining question of the period was who constituted ""a real American"".[209]In this context of immigration and displacement, Tom's hostility towards Gatsby, who is the embodiment of ""latest America"",[210]has been interpreted as partly embodyingstatus anxietiesof the time involving anti-immigrant sentiment.[210]Gatsby—whom Tom belittles as ""Mr. Nobody from Nowhere""[211]—functions as a cipher because of his obscure origins, his unclear ethno-religious identity and his indeterminate class status.[212]Although his ethnicity is vague, his last name Gatz and his father's adherence to theLutheranreligion indicate his family are recent German immigrants.[213]This would preclude them from the coveted status ofOld Stock Americans.[213]Consequently, Gatsby's socio-economic ascent is deemed a threat not only due to his status asnouveau riche, but because he is perceived as an outsider.[214]Because of such themes,The Great Gatsbycaptures the perennial American experience as it is a story about change and those who resist it—whether such change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants, thenouveau riche, or successful minorities.[187]Since Americans living in the 1920s to the present are largely defined by their fluctuating socio-economic circumstances and must navigate a society with entrenched racial and ethnic prejudices, Fitzgerald's depiction of resultant status anxieties and social conflict has been highlighted by scholars as still enduringly relevant nearly a hundred years after the novel's publication.[187][215]Sexuality and identity[edit]Photo of Fitzgerald dressed as a woman circa 1915Questions regarding the sexuality of characters have been raised for decades and—augmented by biographical details about the author—have given rise toqueer readings.[216]During his lifetime, Fitzgerald's sexuality became a subject of debate among his friends and acquaintances.[217][218][219]As a youth, Fitzgerald had a close relationship with Father Sigourney Fay,[220]a possiblygayCatholic priest,[221][222]and Fitzgerald later used his last name for the idealized romantic character of Daisy Fay.[223]After college, Fitzgeraldcross-dressedduring outings in Minnesota.[224]Years later, while draftingThe Great Gatsby, rumors dogged Fitzgerald among the American expat community in Paris that he was gay.[218]Soon after, Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Fitzgerald likewise doubted his heterosexuality and asserted that he was acloseted homosexual.[225]She publicly belittled him withhomophobic slurs,[226]and she alleged that Fitzgerald and fellow writerErnest Hemingwayengaged in homosexual relations.[227][228]These incidents strained the Fitzgeralds' marriage at the time of the novel's publication.[225]Although Fitzgerald's sexuality is a subject of scholarly debate,[n]such biographical details lent credence to critical interpretations that his fictional characters are either gay or bisexual surrogates.[o][233][231]As early as 1945, critics such asLionel Trillingnoted that characters inThe Great Gatsby, such as Jordan Baker, were implied to be ""vaguely homosexual"",[234][235]and, in 1960, writerOtto Friedrichcommented upon the ease of examining the thwarted relations depicted in Fitzgerald's fiction through a queer lens.[236]In recent decades, scholarship has focused sharply on the sexuality of Nick Carraway.[237]In one instance in the novel, Carraway departs a drunken orgy with a ""pale, feminine"" man named Mr. McKee and—following suggestive ellipses—Nick next finds himself standing beside a bed while McKee sits between the sheets clad only in his underwear.[238][239]Such scenes have led scholars to describe Nick as possessing an overt queerness and prompted analyses about his emotional attachment to Jay Gatsby.[240]For these reasons, the novel has been described as an exploration of sexual identity during a historical era typified by the societal transition towardsmodernity.[241][242]Technology and environment[edit]Technological and environmental criticisms ofGatsbyseek to place the novel and its characters in a broader historical context.[243]In 1964,Leo Marxargued inThe Machine in the Gardenthat Fitzgerald's work evinces a tension between a complexpastoral idealof a bygone America and the societal transformations caused byindustrializationandmachine technology.[244]Specifically, the valley of the ashes, in between East and West Egg, represents a man-made wasteland which is a byproduct of the industrialization that has made Gatsby's booming lifestyle, including his automobile, possible.[245]Marx argues that Fitzgerald, via Nick, expresses a pastoral longing typical of other 1920s American writers likeWilliam Faulknerand Ernest Hemingway.[246]Although such writers cherish the pastoral ideal, they accept that technological progress has deprived this ideal of nearly all meaning.[247]In this context, Nick's repudiation of the eastern United States represents a futile attempt to withdraw into nature.[247]Yet, as Fitzgerald's work shows, any technological demarcation between the eastern and western United States has vanished,[d]and one cannot escape into a pastoral past.[247]In 2018, scholar Kyle Keeler argued that the voracious pursuit of wealth as criticized in Fitzgerald's novel offers a warning about the perils ofenvironmental destructionin pursuit ofself-interest.[250]According to Kyle Keeler, Gatsby's quest for greater status manifests as self-centered,anthropocentricresource acquisition.[250]Inspired by the predatorymining practicesof his fictional mentor Dan Cody, Gatsby participates in extensivedeforestationamid World War I and then undertakes bootlegging activities reliant upon exploitingSouth American agriculture.[250]Gatsby conveniently ignores the wasteful devastation of the valley of ashes to pursue aconsumerist lifestyleand exacerbates thewealth gapthat became increasingly salient in 1920s America.[250]For these reasons, Keeler argues that—while Gatsby's socioeconomic ascent and self-transformation depend upon these very factors—each one is nonetheless partially responsible for the ongoingecological crisis.[250]Antisemitism[edit]Fitzgerald based the character of Meyer Wolfsheim onJazz AgeracketeerArnold Rothstein(pictured above) who was murdered in 1928.The Great Gatsbyhas been accused ofantisemitismbecause of its use ofJewish stereotypes.[251]One of the novel's supporting characters is Meyer Wolfsheim,[p]aJewishfriend and mentor of Gatsby. A corrupt profiteer who assists Gatsby's bootlegging operations and whofixed the 1919 World Series, he appears only twice in the novel, the second time refusing to attend Gatsby's funeral. Fitzgerald describes Wolfsheim as ""a small, flat-nosed Jew"", with ""tiny eyes"" and ""two fine growths of hair"" in his nostrils.[254]Evoking ethnic stereotypes regarding theJewish nose, he describes Wolfsheim's nose as ""expressive"", ""tragic"", and able to ""flash... indignantly"".[254]The fictional character of Wolfsheim is an allusion to real-life Jewish gamblerArnold Rothstein,[255]a notorious New Yorkcrime kingpinwhom Fitzgerald met once in undetermined circumstances.[256]Rothstein was blamed for match fixing in theBlack Sox Scandalthat tainted the1919 World Series.[257]Wolfsheim has been interpreted as representing theJewish miser stereotype.Richard Levy, author ofAntisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution, claims that Wolfsheim serves to link Jewishness with corruption.[254]In a 1947 article forCommentary, Milton Hindus, an assistant professor of humanities at theUniversity of Chicago, stated that while he believed the book was a superb literary achievement, Wolfsheim was its most abrasive character, and the work contains an antisemitic undertone.[258]However, Hindus argued the Jewish stereotypes displayed by Wolfsheim were typical of the time when the novel was written and set and that its antisemitism was of the ""habitual, customary, 'harmless,' unpolitical variety"".[259]A 2015 article by essayistArthur Krystalagreed with Hindus' assessment that Fitzgerald's use of Jewish caricatures was not driven by malice and merely reflected commonly held beliefs of his time. He notes the accounts ofFrances Kroll, a Jewish woman and secretary to Fitzgerald, who claimed that Fitzgerald was hurt by accusations of antisemitism and responded to critiques of Wolfsheim by claiming he merely ""fulfilled a function in the story and had nothing to do with race or religion"".[251]Adaptations[edit]Further information:Adaptations of The Great GatsbyPlays[edit]Florence Eldridge as Daisy and James Rennie as Gatsby in the first stage adaptation ofThe Great Gatsby, 1926.The first stage adaptation was produced byWilliam Brady, a veteran theatrical impresario and promoter of prize fights, who acquired the rights only a few days after first reading the novel in the spring of 1925. The script was written by the American dramatistOwen Davis, who had won a Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for his play,Icebound.[260]Davis dramatically altered the structure of the novel, rearranging the action in chronological order, eliminating prominent elements such as the valley of ashes and the scene in the Plaza Hotel, and inventing minor characters.[261]The play, directed byGeorge Cukorand starringJames Rennieas Gatsby andFlorence Eldridgeas Daisy, opened onBroadwayon February 2, 1926. It was well received by critics and the public, and the run was extended past the originally scheduled closing date, finally ending on May 22, after 112 performances.[262]The production, with some changes in the cast, then moved to Chicago, where it opened on August 1. Its popularity again led to an extension of the run, which came to an end in late September.[263]A brief one-week return engagement at New York'sShubert Theaterbegan on October 4, after which a road production traveled to several other cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Denver, and Minneapolis.[264]In July 2006, a stage adaptation written bySimon Levyand directed byDavid Esbjornsonpremiered at theGuthrie Theaterin Minneapolis to celebrate the opening of its new building.[265]In 2010, criticBen BrantleyofThe New York Timeshighly praised the debut ofGatz, anOff-Broadwaystaging of the novel's full text byElevator Repair Service.[266]TheNew York Metropolitan OperacommissionedJohn Harbisonto compose anoperatictreatment of the novel to commemorate the 25th anniversary ofJames Levine's debut. The work, calledThe Great Gatsby, premiered on December 20, 1999.[267]The novel has also been adapted for ballet performances. In 2009,BalletMetpremiered a version at the Capitol Theatre inColumbus, Ohio.[268]In 2010,The Washington Balletpremiered a version at theKennedy Center. The show received an encore run the following year.[269]Film[edit]Alobby cardfor the lost1926 film adaptationThe 1926 film trailer—the only extant footageThe first film version of the novelappeared in 1926. A version of Owen Davis's Broadway play of the same year, it was directed byHerbert Brenonand starredWarner Baxter,Lois WilsonandWilliam Powell. It is a famous example of alost film. Reviews suggest it may have been the most faithful adaptation of the novel, but a trailer of the film at theNational Archivesis all that is known to exist.[270]Reportedly, Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda loathed the silent version. Zelda wrote to an acquaintance that the film was ""rotten"". She and Scott left the cinema midway through the film.[271]Following the 1926 film was 1949'sThe Great Gatsby, directed byElliott Nugentand starringAlan Ladd,Betty FieldandMacdonald Carey.[272]Twenty-five years later in 1974,The Great Gatsbyappeared onscreen again. It was directed byJack Claytonand starredRobert Redfordas Gatsby,Mia Farrowas Daisy, andSam Waterstonas Nick Carraway.[272]Most recently,The Great Gatsbywas directed byBaz Luhrmannin 2013 and starredLeonardo DiCaprioas Gatsby,Carey Mulliganas Daisy, andTobey Maguireas Nick.[271]In 2021, visual effects companyDNEG Animationannounced they would be producing an animated film adaptation of the novel directed byWilliam Joyceand written byBrian Selznick.[273]Television[edit]Gatsbyhas been retold as a short-form television movie multiple times. The first was in 1955 as anNBCepisode forRobert Montgomery PresentsstarringRobert Montgomery,Phyllis Kirk, andLee Bowman. The episode was directed by Alvin Sapinsley.[274]In 1958,CBSfilmed another adaptation as an episode ofPlayhouse 90, also titledThe Great Gatsby,which was directed byFranklin J. Schaffnerand starredRobert Ryan,Jeanne CrainandRod Taylor.[275]Most recently, the novel was adapted as anA&E moviein 2000.The Great Gatsbywas directed byRobert Markowitzand starredToby Stephensas Gatsby,Mira Sorvinoas Daisy, andPaul Ruddas Nick.[276][275]Musicals[edit]TheYale Dramatic Associationperformed the first musical production ofThe Great Gatsbyin Summer 1956.[277][278]For the production, Aubrey L. Goodman adapted Fitzgerald's novel and wrote the lyrics for 14 songs by composer Robert E. Morgan. The show was performed in theUniversity TheatreatYale Universityto sold-out performances.[279]After the Yale production, a number of musical adaptations followed.A second musical adaptation debuted in Spring 1998, undertaken by Stage One, with Colin Stevens as Gatsby and Ann Marcuson as Jordan Baker.[280]Directed by Phil Smith with an original score by Thomas Johnson, this jazz adaptation premiered at the Pavilion Theatre inRhyl, Wales.

Scott Fitzgerald as thepoet laureateof theJazz Age, ""the most raucous, gaudy era in U.S. history"".[1]^As a Southern belle, Zelda Sayre's wealthy family employed half-a-dozen domestic servants, many of whom were African-American.[23]She was unaccustomed to domestic labor of any kind and delegated all tasks to her servants.[24][25]^In the original 1925 edition, Fitzgerald wrote that Gatsby and Nick served in the First Division. Fitzgerald revised the text in later editions to be the Third Division.[34]^abThroughout the novel, Fitzgerald identifies his native region of theMidwest—those ""towns beyondthe Ohio""—with the perceived virtuousness and rustic simplicity of theAmerican Westand as culturally distinct from the decadent values of theeastern United States.[248][249]^Another possible model for Tom Buchanan was Southern polo champion and aviatorTommy Hitchcock Jr., whom Fitzgerald met at Long Island parties while in New York.[44]^Primary sources such as Zelda Fitzgerald and F. Scott Fitzgerald's friend Edmund Wilson both stated that Max Gerlach was a neighbor.[37][69]Scholars have yet to find surviving property records for a Long Island residence with Gerlach's name.[70]However, there are likely ""gaps in the record of his addresses"",[70]and an accurate reconstruction of Gerlach's life and whereabouts is greatly hindered ""by the imperfect state of relevant documentation"".[71]^In a 2009 book, scholar Horst Kruse asserts that Max Gerlach was born in or near Berlin, Germany, and, as a young boy, he immigrated with his German parents to America.[73]^With the end of prohibition and the onset of theGreat Depression, Max Gerlach lost his wealth. Living in poverty, he attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head in 1939.[75]^Only two pages of the first draft ofThe Great Gatsbysurvive. Fitzgerald enclosed them with a letter toWilla Catherin 1925. They are now in the Fitzgerald Papers atPrinceton University.[85]^While Fitzgerald worked on the novel, his wife Zelda was romanced by French naval aviator Edouard Jozan and asked for a divorce.[99]^In 2002, over six decades after Fitzgerald's death, his earlier draft of the now-famous novel was published under the titleTrimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby.[112]^Many years afterThe Great Gatsby's publication, Francis Cugat's original painting for the book cover was presumed forever lost until it was found in a trash can at Scribner's and donated to the Princeton University Libraries for its Graphic Arts Collection.[132]^Daisy's statement that she hopes her daughter will be a ""beautiful little fool"" was said byZelda Fitzgeraldwhen their daughter Scottie was born on October 26, 1921, in a St. Paul hospital.[200]^Fessenden (2005) argues that Fitzgerald struggled with his sexual orientation.[229]In contrast, Bruccoli (2002) insists that ""anyone can be called a latent homosexual, but there is no evidence that Fitzgerald was ever involved in a homosexual attachment"".[230]^Scholars have focused on Fitzgerald's statement in a letter that his mind was ""half feminine"".[231]In 1935, Fitzgerald wrote to Laura Guthrie: ""I don't know what it is in me or that comes to me when I start to write. I am half feminine—at least my mind is"".[232]^The spelling ""Wolfshiem"" appears throughout Fitzgerald's original manuscript, while ""Wolfsheim"" was introduced by editorEdmund Wilsonin the second edition.[252]This appears in later Scribner's editions.[253]References[edit]Citations[edit]^Donahue 2013a.^Fitzgerald 1945, p. 16, ""Echoes of the Jazz Age"".^abcFitzgerald 1945, p. 18, ""Echoes of the Jazz Age"".^Fitzgerald 1945, p. 15, ""Echoes of the Jazz Age"": ""Scarcely had the staider citizens of the republic caught their breaths when the wildest of all generations, the generation which had been adolescent during the confusion of the [Great] War, brusquely shouldered my contemporaries out of the way and danced into the limelight.

The book is centered on the sailorIshmael's narrative of the maniacal quest ofAhab, captain of thewhaling shipPequod, for vengeance againstMoby Dick, the giant whitesperm whalethat bit off his leg on the ship's previous voyage. A contribution to the literature of theAmerican Renaissance,Moby-Dickwas published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the author's death in 1891. Its reputation as aGreat American Novelwas established only in the 20th century, after the 1919 centennial of its author's birth.William Faulknersaid he wished he had written the book himself,[1]andD. H. Lawrencecalled it ""one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world"" and ""the greatest book of the sea ever written"".[2]Itsopening sentence, ""Call me Ishmael"", is among world literature's most famous.[3]Melville began writingMoby-Dickin February 1850 and finished 18 months later, a year after he had anticipated. Melville drew on his experience as a common sailor from 1841 to 1844, including on whalers, and on wide reading in whaling literature. The white whale is modeled on a notoriously hard-to-catch albino whaleMocha Dick, and the book's ending is based on the sinking of the whaleshipEssexin 1820. The detailed and realistic descriptions ofsailing,whale huntingand of extractingwhale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration ofclassandsocial status, good and evil, and theexistence of God.The book's literary influences includeShakespeare,Thomas Carlyle,Sir Thomas Browneand theBible. In addition tonarrativeprose, Melville uses styles andliterary devicesranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to Shakespeareanstage directions,soliloquies, andasides. In August 1850, with the manuscript perhaps half finished, he metNathaniel Hawthorneand was deeply impressed by hisMosses from an Old Manse, which hecompared to Shakespearein its cosmic ambitions. This encounter may have inspired him to revise and deepenMoby-Dick, which is dedicated to Hawthorne, ""in token of my admiration for his genius"".The book was first published (in three volumes) asThe Whalein London in October 1851, and under its definitive title,Moby-Dick; or, The Whale, in a single-volume edition in New York in November. The London publisher,Richard Bentley, censored or changed sensitive passages; Melville made revisions as well, including a last-minute change of the title for the New York edition. The whale, however, appears in the text of both editions as ""Moby Dick"", without the hyphen.[4]Reviewers in Britain were largely favorable,[5]though some objected that the tale seemed to be told by a narrator who perished with the ship, as the British edition lacked the epilogue recounting Ishmael's survival. American reviewers were more hostile.[6]PlotThis article's plot summarymay betoo long or excessively detailed.Pleasehelp improve itby removing unnecessary details and making it more concise.(February 2025)(Learn how and when to remove this message)See also:List of Moby-Dick charactersMoby Dickattacking awhalingboatThe illustration ofQueequegin a 1902 editionMoby Dick in a 1902 editionIshmaelnarrates his December travels fromManhattan IslandtoNew Bedford, Massachusetts, with plans to sign up for a whaling voyage as agreen hand. Theinnwhere he arrives is overcrowded, so he must share a bed with a tattooed cannibalPolynesiannamedQueequeg, a harpooneer whose father was king of the fictional island ofRokovoko. The next morning, Ishmael and Queequeg attendFather Mapple's sermon onJonah, then head forNantucket. Ishmael signs up with the Quaker ship-ownersBildadandPelegfor a voyage on their whalerPequod. Peleg describesCaptain Ahab: ""He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man"" who nevertheless ""has his humanities"". They hire Queequeg the following morning and a man namedElijahprophesies a dire fate should Ishmael and Queequeg join Ahab. Shadowy figures board the ship while provisions are loaded, and on a cold Christmas Day, thePequoddeparts the harbor.Ishmael begins the journey with an extensive discussion ofcetology, his system for the zoological classification and natural history of the whale. He then introduces each of the crew members — the chief mate 30-year-oldStarbuck, a NantucketQuakerand realist; his harpooneer Queequeg; second mateStubb, a cheerful man fromCape Cod; Stubb's proud harpooneerTashtego, apure-blooded IndianfromGay Head; the third mateFlaskfromMartha's Vineyard; and Flask's harpooneerDaggoo, a tall African.When Ahab finally appears on thequarterdeck, he announces he seeks revenge on the white whale that took his leg from the knee down, leaving him with aprosthesisfashioned from a whale'sjawbone. Ahab will give the first man to sight Moby Dick adoubloon, which he nails to the mast. Starbuck objects that he has not come for vengeance but for profit, but Ahab's purpose exercises a mysterious spell on Ishmael: ""Ahab's quenchless feud seemed mine.""Traveling fromNantucketto theAzores, Ahab then turns southwest and sails along the coast of South America. But instead of roundingCape Hornat its tip, he heads northeast towards theequatorialPacific Oceanto sail around theCape of Good Hopein southern Africa and into theIndian Ocean.As the ship is en route to Africa,Tashtegosights asperm whaleon the horizon. The five shadowy figures from earlier appear on deck and are revealed as a special crew specially selected by Ahab. Their leader is aParseenamedFedallahwho serves as Ahab's harpooneer. A pursuit of the whale ensues but is unsuccessful.Southeast of theCape of Good Hope, thePequodmakes the first of nine sea-encounters, or ""gams"", with other ships: Ahab hails theGoney(Albatross) to ask whether they have seen the White Whale, but the trumpet through which her captain tries to speak falls into the sea before he can answer. Ishmael explains that because of Ahab's absorption with Moby Dick, he sails on without the customary ""gam"", which Ishmael defines as a ""social meeting of two (or more) Whale-ships"", in which the two captains remain on one ship and the chief mates on the other. In the second gam off the Cape of Good Hope with theTown-Ho, the concealed story of a ""judgment of God"" is revealed, but only to the crew: a defiant sailor who struck an oppressive officer was flogged, and when the punishing officer later led the chase for Moby Dick, he fell from the boat and was killed by the whale.Ishmael digresses on pictures of whales,brit, squid and—after four boats are lowered in vain because Daggoo mistook agiant squidfor the white whale—whale-lines. The next day, in theIndian Ocean, Stubb kills a sperm whale, and that night Fleece, thePequod's black cook, prepares him a rare whale steak. Fleece, at Stubb's request, delivers a sermon to the sharks that fight each other to feast on the whale's carcass, tied to the ship, saying that their nature is to be voracious, but they must overcome it. The whale is prepared, beheaded, and barrels of oil are tried out. Standing at the head of the whale, Ahab begs it to speak of the depths of the sea. ThePequodnext encounters theJeroboam, which not only lost its chief mate to Moby Dick, but also is now plagued by anendemicinfection.The whale carcass still lies in the water. Queequeg mounts it, tied to Ishmael's belt by a monkey-rope as if they wereSiamese twins. Stubb and Flask later kill aright whalewhose head is fastened to ayardarmopposite the sperm whale's head. Ishmael compares the two heads in a philosophical way: the right whale isLockean,stoic, and the sperm whale isKantean,platonic. Tashtego cuts into the head of the sperm whale and retrieves buckets ofspermaceti. He falls into the head, which in turn falls off the yardarm into the sea. Queequeg dives after him and frees Tashtego with his sword.ThePequodnext gams with theJungfraufrom Bremen. Both ships sight whales simultaneously, with thePequodwinning the contest. The three harpooneers dart their harpoons, and Flask delivers the mortal strike with a lance. The carcass sinks, and Queequeg barely manages to escape. ThePequod's next gam is with the French whalerBouton de Rose, whose crew is ignorant of theambergrisin the gut of the diseased whale in their possession. Stubb talks them out of continuing, but Ahab orders him away. Days later,Pip, a little African American cabin-boy, jumps in panic from Stubb's whale boat and the whale must be cut loose because Pip is entangled in the line; a few days later Pip again jumps in panic, is left alone in the sea, and has goneinsaneby the time they find him.The crew spends time processing various harvested whale parts — liquifyingcongealedspermaceti, boilingblubber, decanting warm oil into casks, stowing them incargo, and scrubbing thedecks.Ishmael discusses the symbolism in the coin hammered to the main mast, which shows threeAndessummits: one with a flame, another a tower, the third a crowing cock. Ahab looks at the doubloon and interprets the mountains as his volcanic energy, firmness, and victory; Starbuck takes the high peaks as theTrinity; Stubb focuses on the zodiacal arch over the mountains; and Flask sees no meaning. The Manxman mutters in front of the mast, and Pip declines when he is told to look.ThePequodnext gams with theSamuel Enderbyof London, captained by Boomer, who lost his right arm to the whale but still carries it no ill will. His ship's surgeon, Dr. Bunger, describes the animal not as malicious, but awkward. Ahab puts an end to the gam by rushing back to his ship.Ishmael then discusses theevolutionof whales, specifically discussing agleninTranqueof theArsacides Islandsfull of carved whale bones and fossilized whales where one can see the decreasing size of their skeletons over time, and he considers the possibility of whaleextinction.Leaving theSamuel Enderby, Ahab wrenches his ivory leg and orders the carpenter to fashion him another. Meanwhile Queequeg, sweating all day below deck, develops a chill and severe fever. The carpenter makes a coffin for the Polynesian, anticipating aburial at sea. Queequeg tries it for size as Pip sobs and beats his tambourine, standing by and calling himself a coward while he praises his companion. Queequeg suddenly rallies and returns to good health and uses his coffin as a spare seachest.ThePequodsails northeast towardFormosaand into the Pacific Ocean. Ahab, with one nostril, smells the musk from theBasheeisles, and with the other, the salt of the waters where Moby Dick swims. Ahab goes to Perth, the blacksmith, with a bag of racehorse shoenail stubs to be forged into the shank of a special harpoon, and with hisrazorsfor Perth to melt and fashion into aharpoonbarb. Ahab tempers the barb in blood from Queequeg, Tashtego, and Daggoo.ThePequodgams next with theBachelor, a Nantucket ship heading home full of sperm oil. Every now and then, thePequodlowers for whales with success. On one of those nights in the whaleboat, Fedallah prophesies that neitherhearsenor coffin can be Ahab's, that before he dies, Ahab must see two hearses — one not made by mortal hands and the other made of American wood — that Fedallah will precede his captain in death, and finally that onlyhempcan kill Ahab.As thePequodapproaches the equator, Ahab scolds his quadrant for telling him only where he is and not where he will be, and dashes it to the deck. That evening, atyphoonattacks the ship and lightning strikes the mast, setting the doubloon and Ahab's harpoon aglow. Ahab delivers a speech on the fire, seeing the lightning as a portent of Moby Dick. Starbuck sees the lightning as awarning, and feels tempted to shoot the sleeping Ahab with hismusket. The next morning, when he finds that the lightning disoriented the compass, Ahab makes a new one out of a lance, a maul, and a sailmaker's needle. He orders thelogbe heaved, but the weathered line snaps, leaving the ship with no way to fix its location.ThePequodis now heading southeast toward Moby Dick. A man falls overboard from the mast. The life buoy is thrown, but both sink. Queequeg now proposes that his coffin be used as a newbuoyand Starbuck has it sealed and waterproofed. The next morning, the ship meets in another truncated gam with theRachel, commanded by Captain Gardiner from Nantucket. TheRachelis seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick. Among the missing is Gardiner's young son, but Ahab refuses to join the search.Ahab now spends twenty-four hours a day on deck while Fedallah shadows him. One day, a sea hawk grabs Ahab's slouched hat and flies off with it. Next, thePequod, in a ninth and final gam, meets theDelight, badly damaged and with five of her crew left dead by Moby Dick. Her captain shouts that the harpoon which can kill the white whale has yet to be forged, to which Ahab flourishes his special lance and once more orders the ship forward. Ahab speaks to Starbuck about his wife and child, calling himself a fool for spending 40 years whaling, and says he can see his own child in Starbuck. Starbuck tries to persuade Ahab to return to Nantucket to meet their families, but Ahab refuses.On the first day of the chase, Ahab smells the whale, climbs the mast, and sights Moby Dick. He claims the doubloon for himself, and orders all boats to lower except for Starbuck's. The whale bites Ahab's boat in two, tosses the captain into the sea and scatters his crew. On the second day of the chase, Ahab leaves Starbuck in charge of thePequod. Moby Dick smashes the three boats hunting him to splinters. Ahab is rescued, but his ivory leg and Fedallah are lost. Starbuck begs Ahab to stop, but the captain vows revenge.On the third and final day of the chase, Ahab sights Moby Dick at noon as sharks appear between the ship and the whale in anticipation of the ensuing carnage. Ahab lowers his boat for the final time, leaving Starbuck again on board. Moby Dick breaches and destroys two boats. Fedallah's corpse, still entangled in the fouled lines, is lashed to the whale's back, making Moby Dick the ""hearse not made by human hands"" Fedallah had prophesied earlier.Ahab plants his harpoon in the whale's flank and Moby Dick destroys thePequod, tossing its men into the sea. Ishmael is unable to return to the boat and is left behind in the water. Ahab then realizes the destroyed ship is the second hearse of American wood from Fedallah's prophecy.Moby Dick returns within a few yards of Ahab's boat and a harpoon is darted from the ship but its line tangles. As Ahab stoops to free it, the line loops around his neck, ensnaring him against his nemesis and completing Fedallah's augury. As the mortally stricken whale swims away, the captain is drawn with him out of sight. Queequeg's coffin comes to the surface as the only thing to escape the vortex when thePequodsinks. Ishmael floats on it for a day and a night until theRachel, still looking for its lost seamen, rescues him.StructurePoint of viewIshmael is the narrator, shaping his story with the use of many different genres including sermons, stage plays, soliloquies, and emblematical readings.[7]Repeatedly, Ishmael refers to his writing of the book: ""But how can I hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself? I must, else all these chapters might be naught.""[8]Scholar John Bryant calls him the novel's ""central consciousness and narrative voice"".[9]Walter Bezansonfirst distinguishes Ishmael as narrator from Ishmael as character, whom he calls ""forecastle Ishmael"", the younger Ishmael of some years ago. Narrator Ishmael, then, is ""merely young Ishmael grown older"".[7]A second distinction is between either or both Ishmaels with the author Herman Melville. Bezanson warns readers to ""resist any one-to-one equation of Melville and Ishmael"".[10]Chapter structureAccording to critic Walter Bezanson, the chapter structure can be divided into ""chapter sequences"", ""chapter clusters"", and ""balancing chapters"". The simplest sequences are of narrative progression, then sequences of theme such as the three chapters on whale painting, and sequences of structural similarity, such as the five dramatic chapters beginning with ""The Quarter-Deck"" or the four chapters beginning with ""The Candles"". Chapter clusters are the chapters on the significance of the color white, and those on the meaning of fire. Balancing chapters are chapters of opposites, such as ""Loomings"" versus the ""Epilogue"", or similars, such as ""The Quarter-Deck"" and ""The Candles"".[11]ScholarLawrence Buelldescribes the arrangement of the non-narrative chapters[note 1]as structured around three patterns: first, the nine meetings of thePequodwith ships that have encountered Moby Dick. Each has been more and more severely damaged, foreshadowing thePequod's own fate. Second, the increasingly impressive encounters with whales. In the early encounters, the whaleboats hardly make contact; later there are false alarms and routine chases; finally, the massive assembling of whales at the edges of the China Sea in ""The Grand Armada"". A typhoon near Japan sets the stage for Ahab's confrontation with Moby Dick.[12]The third pattern is the cetological documentation, so lavish that it can be divided into two subpatterns. These chapters start with the ancient history of whaling and a bibliographical classification of whales, getting closer with second-hand stories of the evil of whales in general and of Moby Dick in particular, a chronologically ordered commentary on pictures of whales. The climax to this section is chapter 57, ""Of whales in paint etc."", which begins with the humble (a beggar in London) and ends with the sublime (the constellation Cetus). The next chapter (""Brit""), thus the other half of this pattern, begins with the book's first description of live whales, and next the anatomy of the sperm whale is studied, more or less from front to rear and from outer to inner parts, all the way down to the skeleton. Two concluding chapters set forth the whale's evolution as a species and claim its eternal nature.[12]Some ""ten or more"" of the chapters on whale killings, beginning at two-fifths of the book, are developed enough to be called ""events"". As Bezanson writes, ""in each case a killing provokes either a chapter sequence or a chapter cluster of cetological lore growing out of the circumstance of the particular killing,"" thus these killings are ""structural occasions for ordering the whaling essays and sermons"".[13]Buell observes that the ""narrative architecture"" is an ""idiosyncratic variant of the bipolar observer/hero narrative"", that is, the novel is structured around the two main characters, Ahab and Ishmael, who are intertwined and contrasted with each other, with Ishmael the observer and narrator.[14]As the story of Ishmael, remarks Robert Milder, it is a ""narrative of education"".[15]Bryant and Springer find that the book is structured around the two consciousnesses of Ahab and Ishmael, with Ahab as a force of linearity and Ishmael a force of digression.[16]While both have an angry sense of being orphaned, they try to come to terms with this hole in their beings in different ways: Ahab with violence, Ishmael with meditation. And while the plot inMoby-Dickmay be driven by Ahab's anger, Ishmael's desire to get a hold of the ""ungraspable"" accounts for the novel's lyricism.[17]Buell sees a double quest in the book: Ahab's is to hunt Moby Dick, Ishmael's is ""to understand what to make of both whale and hunt"".[14]One of the most distinctive features of the book is the variety of genres. Bezanson mentions sermons, dreams, travel account, autobiography, Elizabethan plays, and epic poetry.[18]He calls Ishmael's explanatory footnotes to establish the documentary genre ""a Nabokovian touch"".[19]Nine meetings with other shipsA significant structural device is the series of nine meetings between thePequodand other ships. These meetings are important in three ways. First, their placement in the narrative: the initial two meetings and the last two are both close to each other. The central group of five gams are separated by about 12 chapters. This pattern provides a structural element, remarks Bezanson, as if the encounters were ""bones to the book's flesh"". Second, Ahab's developing responses to the meetings plot the ""rising curve of his passion"" and of his monomania. Third, in contrast to Ahab, Ishmael interprets the significance of each ship individually: ""each ship is a scroll which the narrator unrolls and reads"".[13]Bezanson sees no single way to account for the meaning of all of these ships. Instead, they may be interpreted as ""a group of metaphysical parables, a series of biblical analogues, a masque of the situation confronting man, a pageant of the humors within men, a parade of the nations, and so forth, as well as concrete and symbolic ways of thinking about the White Whale"".[20]Scholar Nathalia Wright sees the meetings and the significance of the vessels along other lines. She singles out the four vessels which have already encountered Moby Dick. The first, theJeroboam, is named after the predecessor of the biblical KingAhab. Her ""prophetic"" fate is ""a message of warning to all who follow, articulated by Gabriel and vindicated by theSamuel Enderby, theRachel, theDelight, and at last thePequod"". None of the other ships has been completely destroyed because none of their captains shared Ahab'smonomania; the fate of theJeroboamreinforces the structural parallel between Ahab and his biblical namesake: ""Ahab did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him"" (I Kings16:33).[21]ThemesAn early enthusiast for the Melville Revival, British authorE. M. Forsterremarked in 1927: ""Moby-Dickis full of meanings: its meaning is a different problem.""[22]Yet he saw as ""the essential"" in the book ""its prophetic song"", which flows ""like an undercurrent"" beneath the surface action and morality.[23]The hunt for the whale can be seen as a metaphor for anepistemologicalquest—in the words of biographer Laurie Robertson-Lorant, ""man's search for meaning in a world of deceptive appearances and fatal delusions"".[24]Ishmael's taxonomy of whales merely demonstrates ""the limitations of scientific knowledge and the impossibility of achieving certainty"". She also contrasts Ishmael's and Ahab's attitudes toward life, with Ishmael's open-minded and meditative, ""polypositional stance"" as antithetical to Ahab'smonomania, adhering to dogmatic rigidity.[25]Melville biographerAndrew Delbancocites race as an example of this search for truth beneath surface differences, noting that all races are represented among the crew members of thePequod. Although Ishmael initially is afraid of Queequeg as a tattooed possiblecannibal, he soon decides that he would ""Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.""[26]While it may be rare for a mid-19th century American book to feature Black characters in a nonslavery context, slavery is frequently mentioned. The theme of race is carried primarily by Pip, the diminutive Black cabin boy.[27]When Pip has almost drowned, and Ahab, genuinely touched by Pip's suffering, questions him gently, Pip ""can only parrot the language of an advertisement for the return of a fugitive slave: 'Pip! Reward for Pip!'"".[28]Editors Bryant and Springer suggest that perception is a central theme—the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. Ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: ""All visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks""—and Ahab is determined to ""strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach outside, except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is that wall"" (Ch. 36, ""The Quarter-Deck""). This theme pervades the novel, perhaps never so emphatically as in ""The Doubloon"" (Ch. 99), where each crewmember perceives the coin in a way shaped by his own personality. Later, the American edition has Ahab ""discover no sign"" (Ch. 133) of the whale when he is staring into the deep. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. In the British edition, Melville changed the word ""discover"" to ""perceive"", and with good reason, for ""discovery"" means finding what is already there, but ""perceiving"", or better still, perception, is ""a matter of shaping what exists by the way in which we see it"".[29]The point is not that Ahab would discover the whale as an object, but that he would perceive it as a symbol of his making.[29]Yet Melville does not offer easy solutions. Ishmael and Queequeg's sensual friendship initiates a kind of racial harmony that is shattered when the crew's dancing erupts into racial conflict in ""Midnight, Forecastle"" (Ch. 40).[16]Fifty chapters later, Pip suffers mental disintegration after he is reminded that as a slave he would be worth less money than a whale. Commodified and brutalized, ""Pip becomes the ship's conscience"".[30]His views of property are another example of wrestling with moral choice. In Chapter 89, ""Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish"", Ishmael expounds the legal concept ""fast-fish and loose-fish"", which gives right of ownership to those who take possession of an abandoned fish or ship; he compares the concept to events in history, such as theEuropean colonization of the Americas, thepartitions of Poland, and theMexican–American War.[31]The novel has also been read as critical of the contemporary literary and philosophical movementTranscendentalism, attacking the thought of leading Transcendentalist[32]Ralph Waldo Emersonin particular.[33]The life and death of Ahab has been read as an attack on Emerson's philosophy ofself-reliance, for one, in its destructive potential and potential justification foregoism. Richard Chase writes that for Melville, ""Death—spiritual, emotional, physical—is the price of self-reliance when it is pushed to the point ofsolipsism, where the world has no existence apart from the all-sufficient self.""[34]In that regard, Chase sees Melville's art as antithetical to that of Emerson's thought, in that Melville ""[points] up the dangers of an exaggerated self-regard, rather than, as ... Emerson loved to do, [suggested] the vital possibilities of the self"".[34]Newton Arvin further suggests that self-reliance was, for Melville, really the ""[masquerade in kingly weeds of] a wild egoism, anarchic, irresponsible, and destructive"".[35]Style""Above all"", say the scholars Bryant and Springer,Moby-Dickis language: ""nautical,biblical,Homeric,Shakespearean,Miltonic,cetological,alliterative, fanciful,colloquial, archaic and unceasinglyallusive"". Melville stretches grammar, quotes well-known or obscure sources, or swings from calm prose to high rhetoric, technical exposition, seaman's slang, mystic speculation, or wild prophetic archaism.[36]Melville coined words, criticNewton Arvinrecognizes, as if the English vocabulary were too limited for the complex things he had to express. Perhaps the most striking example is the use of verbal nouns, mostly plural, such asallurings,coincidings, andleewardings. Equally abundant are unfamiliar adjectives and adverbs, including participial adjectives such asofficered,omnitooled, anduncatastrophied; participial adverbs such asintermixingly,postponedly, anduninterpenetratingly; rarities such as the adjectivesunsmoothable,spermy, andleviathanic, and adverbs such assultanically,Spanishly, andVenetianly; and adjectival compounds ranging from odd to magnificent, such as ""themessage-carryingair"", ""thecircus-runningsun"", and ""teeth-tieredsharks"".[37]It is rarer for Melville to create his own verbs from nouns, but he does this with what Arvin calls ""irresistible effect"", such as in ""who didstthunderhim higher than a throne"", and ""my fingers ... began ... toserpentineandspiralize"".[38]For Arvin, the essence of the writing style ofMoby-Dicklies inthe manner in which the parts of speech are 'intermixingly' assorted in Melville's style—so that the distinction between verbs and nouns, substantives and modifiers, becomes a half unreal one—this is the prime characteristic of his language. No feature of it could express more tellingly the awareness that lies below and behindMoby-Dick—the awareness that action and condition, movement and stasis, object and idea, are but surface aspects of one underlying reality.[39]Later critics have expanded Arvin's categories. The superabundant vocabulary can be broken down into strategies used individually and in combination. First, the original modification of words as ""Leviathanism""[40]and the exaggerated repetition of modified words, as in the series ""pitiable"", ""pity"", ""pitied"" and ""piteous"" (Ch. 81, ""The Pequod Meets the Virgin"").[41]Second, the use of existing words in new ways, as when the whale ""heaps"" and ""tasks"".[40]Third, words lifted from specialized fields, as ""fossiliferous"".[40]Fourth, the use of unusual adjective-noun combinations, as in ""concentrating brow"" and ""immaculate manliness"" (Ch. 26, ""Knights and Squires"").[42]Fifth, using the participial modifier to emphasize and to reinforce the already established expectations of the reader, as the words ""preluding"" and ""foreshadowing"" (""so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene ...""; ""In this foreshadowing interval ..."").[41]Other characteristic stylistic elements are the echoes and overtones, both imitation of distinct styles and habitual use of sources to shape his own work. His three most important sources, in order, are the Bible, Shakespeare, and Milton.[43]The novel uses several levels of rhetoric. The simplest is ""a relatively straightforwardexpositorystyle"", such as in the cetological chapters, though they are ""rarely sustained, and serve chiefly as transitions"" between more sophisticated levels. A second level is the ""poetic"", such as in Ahab's quarterdeck monologue, to the point that it can be set asblank verse.[44]Set over a metrical pattern, the rhythms are ""evenly controlled—too evenly perhaps for prose"", Bezanson suggests.[45]A third level is theidiomatic, and just as the poetic it hardly is present in pure form. Examples of this are ""the consistently excellent idiom"" of Stubb, such as in the way he encourages the rowing crew in a rhythm of speech that suggests ""the beat of the oars takes the place of the metronomic meter"". The fourth and final level of rhetoric is thecomposite, ""a magnificent blending"" of the first three and possible other elements:The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.Thereis his home;therelies his business, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.(""Nantucket"", Ch. 14).Bezanson calls this chapter a comical ""prose poem"" that blends ""high and low with a relaxed assurance"". Similar passages include the ""marvelous hymn to spiritual democracy"" in the middle of ""Knights and Squires"".[46]The elaborate use of theHomeric similemay not have been learned from Homer himself, yet Matthiessen finds the writing ""more consistently alive"" on the Homeric than on the Shakespearean level, especially during the final chase the ""controlled accumulation"" of such similes emphasizes Ahab'shubristhrough a succession of land-images, for instance: ""The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a cannon-ball, missent, becomes a ploughshare and turns up the level field"" (""The Chase – Second Day"", Ch. 134).[47]A paragraph-long simile describes how the 30 men of the crew became a single unit:For as the one ship that held them all; though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.(""The Chase – Second Day"", Ch. 134).The final phrase fuses the two halves of the comparison; the men become identical with the ship, which follows Ahab's direction. The concentration only gives way to more imagery: the ""mastheads, like the tops of tall palms, were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs"". All these images contribute their ""startling energy"" to the advance of the narrative. When the boats are lowered, the imagery serves to dwarf everything but Ahab's will in the presence of Moby Dick.[47]These similes, with their astonishing ""imaginative abundance,"" not only create dramatic movement, Matthiessen observes: ""They are no less notable for breadth; and the more sustained among them, for an heroic dignity.""[48]Assimilation of ShakespeareF. O. Matthiessen, in 1941, declared that Melville's ""possession by Shakespeare went far beyond all other influences"" in that it made Melville discover his own full strength ""through the challenge of the most abundant imagination in history"".[49]This insight was then reinforced by the study of Melville's annotatations in his reading copy of Shakespeare, which show that he immersed himself in Shakespeare when he was preparing forMoby-Dick, especiallyKing LearandMacbeth.[50]Reading Shakespeare, Matthiessen observes, was ""a catalytic agent"", one that transformed his writing ""from limited reporting to the expression of profound natural forces"".[51]The creation of Ahab, Melville biographer Leon Howard discovered, followed an observation by Coleridge in his lecture onHamlet: ""one of Shakespeare's modes of creating characters is to conceive any one intellectual or moral faculty inmorbidexcess, and then to place himself. ... thusmutilatedordiseased, under given circumstances"".[52]Coleridge's vocabulary is echoed in some phrases that describe Ahab. Ahab seemed to have ""what seems a half-wilfulover-ruling morbidnessat the bottom of his nature"", and ""all men tragically great"", Melville added, ""are made so through a certainmorbidness; ""all mortal greatness is butdisease"". In addition to this, in Howard's view, the self-references of Ishmael as a ""tragic dramatist"", and his defense of his choice of a hero who lacked ""all outward majestical trappings"" is evidence that Melville ""consciously thought of his protagonist as a tragic hero of the sort found inHamletandKing Lear"".[52]Matthiessen demonstrates the extent to which Melville was in full possession of his powers in the description of Ahab, which ends in languagethat suggests Shakespeare's but is not an imitation of it: 'Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it must needs be plucked from the skies and dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!' The imaginative richness of the final phrase seems particularly Shakespearean, ""but its two key words appear only once each in the plays ... and to neither of these usages is Melville indebted for his fresh combination"".[53]Melville's assimilation of Shakespeare, Matthiessen concludes, gaveMoby-Dick""a kind of diction that depended upon no source"",[54]and that could, as D.H. Lawrence put it, convey something ""almost superhuman or inhuman, bigger than life"".[55]The prose is not based on anybody else's verse but on ""a sense of speech rhythm"".[56]Matthiessen finds debts to Shakespeare, whether hard or easy to recognize, on almost every page. He points out that the phrase ""mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing"" at the end of ""Cetology"" (Ch.32) echoes the famous phrase inMacbeth: ""Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.""[49]Matthiessen shows that Ahab's first extended speech to the crew, in the ""Quarter-Deck"" (Ch.36), is ""virtually blank verse, and can be printed as such"":[49]But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat,That thing unsays itself. There are menFrom whom warm words are small indignity.I mean not to incense thee. Let it go.Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—Living, breathing pictures painted by the sun.The pagan leopards—the unrecking andUnworshipping things, that live; and seek and giveNo reason for the torrid life they feel![57]In addition to this sense of rhythm, Matthiessen shows that Melville ""now mastered Shakespeare's mature secret of how to make language itself dramatic"".[56]He had learned three essential things, Matthiessen sums up:To rely on verbs of action, ""which lend their dynamic pressure to both movement and meaning"".[56]The effective tension caused by the contrast of ""thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds"" and ""there's that in here that still remains indifferent"" in ""The Candles"" (Ch. 119) makes the last clause lead to a ""compulsion to strike the breast"", which suggests ""how thoroughly the drama has come to inhere in the words"".[58]The Shakespearean energy of verbal compounds was not lost on him (""full-freighted"").Finally: Melville learned how to handle ""the quickened sense of life that comes from making one part of speech act as another—for example, 'earthquake' as an adjective, or the coining of 'placeless', an adjective from a noun"".[59]Thomas CarlyleCritics have seen parallels betweenMoby DickandThomas Carlyle's work, particularlySartor Resartus(1833–34),On Heroes, Hero-Worship, & the Heroic in History(1841) and theCritical and Miscellaneous Essays, which Melville read while writing the novel.[60]James Barbour and biographer Leon Howard write that ""Carlyle's rhetoric is reflected"" in much of the dialogue of Ahab and Ishmael, while Melville usesSartor's philosophical concepts of ""an emblematic universe"" and a ""weaver god"" ""almost in Carlyle's words"".[61]Alexander Welshargues that Carlyle figured ""largely in the undertaking ofMoby Dick"", noting that the ""figure of the sheep in 'The Funeral' ... is taken directly from Carlyle"", specifically the essay ""Boswell's Life of Johnson"" (1832) and that the ""language of herring and whales, fleets and commodores"" may have been borrowed fromSartor.[62]According toPaul Giles,Sartor""furnished Melville with a prototype for his playful iconoclastic style inMoby-Dick"", particularly in its narrative strategy and romantic ironic paradoxes.[63]The ""shared use of the clothing metaphor"" is also inspired bySartor.[64]Jonathan Aracsees inMoby-Dick""a direct appropriation"" of Carlyle's ""Hero"". ""Ahab"", writes Arac, ""is very much a Carlylean hero"", which Carlyle's ""romantic image ofCromwellhelped Melville to create"". Carlyle's portraits ofDante Alighieriand Shakespeare in ""The Hero as Poet"", the third lecture ofOn Heroes, ""offered models that helped Melville to develop as a reader and to achieve the definition of himself as a writer that madeMoby-Dickpossible"".[65]Renaissance humanismDuring the composition ofMoby-DickMelville also read Renaissance Humanists such asThomas Browne,Robert Burton, and Rabelais.Hershel Parkernotes that Melville adopted not only their poetic and conversational prose styles, but also their skeptical attitudes towards religion.[66]Browne's statement ""I love to lose my selfe in a mystery to pursue my reason to anob altitudo""[67]mirrors both in ethos and poetics Ishmael's ""I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it.""[68]Ishmael also mirrors the epistemological uncertainty of Renaissance humanists. For example, Browne argues that ""where there is an obscurity too deepe for our reason ...[reason] becomes more humble and submissive unto the subtilties of faith ... I believe there was already a tree whose fruit our unhappy parents tasted, though in the same chapter, when God forbids it, 'tis positivley said, the plants of the field were not yet growne.""[69]Ishmael similarly embraces paradox when he proclaims ""Doubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye.""[70]Scholars have also called attention to similarities between Melville's style and that of Robert Burton inAnatomy of Melancholy. William Engel notes that Melville had Burton's book at his side, and says ""this encyclopedic work will serve as a conceptual touchstone for analyzing his looking back to an earlier aesthetic practice.""[71]Additionally, Hershel Parker writes that in 1847,Anatomy of Melancholyserved as Melville's ""sonorous textbook on morbid psychology"" and in the following year he bought a set ofMichel de Montaigne's works. In theEssayshe found ""a worldly wise skepticism that braced him against the superficial pieties demanded by his time"". Melville then read Browne'sReligio Mediciwhich he adored, describing Browne to a friend as ""a kind of 'crack'd archangel'"".[72]BackgroundAutobiographical elementsMoby-Dickdraws on Melville's experience on the whalerAcushnet, but is not autobiographical. On December 30, 1840, Melville signed on as a green hand for the maiden voyage of theAcushnet, planned to last for 52 months. Its owner, Melvin O. Bradford, like Bildad, was aQuaker: on several instances when he signed documents, he erased the word ""swear"" and replaced it with ""affirm"". However, the shareholders of theAcushnetwere relatively wealthy, whereas the owners of thePequodincluded poor widows and orphaned children.[73]The model for the Whaleman's Chapel of chapter 7 is theSeamen's Bethelon Johnny Cake Hill. Melville attended a service there shortly before he shipped out on theAcushnet, and he heard a sermon by ReverendEnoch Mudge, who is at least in part the inspiration for Father Mapple. Even the topic ofJonah and the Whalemay be authentic, for Mudge contributed sermons on Jonah toSailor's Magazine.[74]The crew was not as heterogenous or exotic as the crew of thePequod. Five were foreigners, four of them Portuguese, and the others were American either at birth or naturalized. Three black men were in the crew, two seamen and the cook. Fleece, the black cook of thePequod, was probably modeled on this Philadelphia-born William Maiden.[75]Afirst mate, actually called Edward C. Starbuck was discharged atTahitiunder mysterious circumstances.[76]Thesecond mate, John Hall, is identified as Stubb in an annotation in the book's copy of crew member Henry Hubbard, who also identified the model for Pip: John Backus, a little black man added to the crew during the voyage.[77]Hubbard witnessed Pip's fall into the water.[78]Ahab seems to have had no model, though his death may have been based on an actual event. Melville was aboardThe Starin May 1843 with two sailors from theNantucketwho could have told him that they had seen their second mate ""taken out of a whaleboat by a foul line and drowned"".[79]Whaling sourcesSee also:Cetology of Moby-DickMelville's copy ofNatural History of the Sperm Whale, published in 1839A portrait ofMoby-DickauthorHerman MelvilleIn addition to his own experience on the whaling shipAcushnet, two actual events served as the genesis for Melville's tale. One was the sinking of the Nantucket shipEssexin 1820, after a sperm whale rammed her 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the western coast of South America. First mateOwen Chase, one of eight survivors, recorded the events in his 1821Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex.[80]The other event was the alleged killing in the late 1830s of the albino sperm whaleMocha Dick, in the waters off the Chilean island ofMocha. Mocha Dick was rumored to have 20 or so harpoons in his back from other whalers, and appeared to attack ships with premeditated ferocity. One of his battles with a whaler served as subject for an article by explorerJ. N. Reynoldsin the May 1839 issue ofThe Knickerbockeror New-York Monthly Magazine.[81]Melville was familiar with the article, which described:This renowned monster, who had come off victorious in a hundred fights with his pursuers, was an old bull whale, of prodigious size and strength. From the effect of age, or more probably from a freak of nature ... a singular consequence had resulted —he was white as wool![81]Significantly, Reynolds writes afirst-person narrationthat serves as aframefor the story of a whaling captain he meets. The captain resembles Ahab and suggests a similar symbolism and single-minded motivation in hunting this whale, in that when his crew first encounters Mocha Dick and cowers from him, the captain rallies them:As he drew near, with his long curved back looming occasionally above the surface of the billows, we perceived that it was white as the surf around him; and the men stared aghast at each other, as they uttered, in a suppressed tone, the terrible name of MOCHA DICK!
""Mocha Dick or the d----l [devil]', said I, 'this boat never sheers off from any thing that wears the shape of a whale.'""[81]Mocha Dick had over 100 encounters with whalers in the decades between 1810 and the 1830s. He was described as being gigantic and covered in barnacles. Although he was the most famous, Mocha Dick was not the only white whale in the sea, nor the only whale to attack hunters.[82]While an accidental collision with a sperm whale at night accounted for sinking of theUnionin 1807,[83]it was not until August 1851 that the whalerAnn Alexander, while hunting in the Pacific off theGalápagos Islands, became the second vessel since theEssexto be attacked, holed, and sunk by a whale. Melville remarked, ""Ye Gods! What a commentator is thisAnn Alexanderwhale. What he has to say is short & pithy & very much to the point. I wonder if my evil art has raised this monster.""[84]While Melville had already drawn on his different sailing experiences in his previous novels, such asMardi, he had never focused specifically on whaling. The 18 months he spent as an ordinary seaman aboard the whalerAcushnetin 1841–42, and one incident in particular, now served as inspiration. During a mid-ocean ""gam"" (rendezvous at sea between ships), he met Chase's son William, who lent him his father's book. Melville later wrote:I questioned him concerning his father's adventure; ... he went to his chest & handed me a complete copy ... of the Narrative [of theEssexcatastrophe]. This was the first printed account of it I had ever seen. The reading of this wondrous story on the landless sea, and so close to the very latitude of the shipwreck, had a surprising effect upon me.[85]The book was out of print, and rare. Melville let his interest in the book be known to his father-in-law,Lemuel Shaw, whose friend in Nantucket procured an imperfect but clean copy which Shaw gave to Melville in April 1851. Melville read this copy avidly, made copious notes in it, and had it bound, keeping it in his library for the rest of his life.[86]Moby-Dickcontains large sections, most of which are narrated by Ishmael, that seemingly have nothing to do with the plot, but describe aspects of the whaling business. Although a successful earlier novel about Nantucket whalers had been written,Miriam Coffin or The Whale-Fisherman(1835) byJoseph C. Hart,[87]which is credited with influencing elements of Melville's work, most accounts of whaling tended to be sensational tales of bloody mutiny. Melville believed that no book up to that time had portrayed the whaling industry in as fascinating or immediate a way as he had experienced it.Melville found the bulk of his data on whales and whaling in five books, the most important of which was by the English ship's surgeon Thomas Beale,Natural History of the Sperm Whale(1839), a book of reputed authority which Melville bought on July 10, 1850.[88]""In scale and complexity,"" scholar Steven Olsen-Smith writes, ""the significance of [this source] to the composition ofMoby-Dicksurpasses that of any other source book from which Melville is known to have drawn.""[89]According to scholarHoward P. Vincent, the general influence of this source is to supply the arrangement of whaling data in chapter groupings.[90]Melville followed Beale's grouping closely, yet adapted it to what art demanded, and he changed the original's prosaic phrases into graphic figures of speech.[91]The second most important whaling book is Frederick Debell Bennett,A Whaling Voyage Round the Globe, from the Year 1833 to 1836(1840), from which Melville also took the chapter organization, but in a lesser degree than he learned from Beale.[91]The third book was the one Melville reviewed for theLiterary Worldin 1847, J. Ross Browne'sEtchings of a Whaling Cruise(1846), which may have given Melville the first thought for a whaling book, and in any case contains passages embarrassingly similar to passages inMoby-Dick.[92]The fourth book, Reverend Henry T. Cheever'sThe Whale and His Captors(1850), was used for two episodes inMoby-Dickbut probably appeared too late in the writing of the novel to be of much more use.[92]Melville did plunder a fifth book,William ScoresbyJr.,An Account of the Arctic Regions with a History and Description of the Northern Whale Fishery(1820), though—unlike the other four books—its subject is theGreenland whalerather than the sperm whale. Although the book became the standard whaling reference soon after publication, Melville satirized and parodied it on several occasions—for instance in the description of narwhales in the chapter ""Cetology"", where he called Scoresby ""Charley Coffin"" and gave his account ""a humorous twist of fact"": ""Scoresby will help out Melville several times, and on each occasion Melville will satirize him under a pseudonym."" Vincent suggests several reasons for Melville's attitude towards Scoresby, including his dryness and abundance of irrelevant data, but the major reason seems to have been that the Greenland whale was the sperm whale's closest competitor for the public's attention, so Melville felt obliged to dismiss anything dealing with it.[93]In addition to cetological works, Melville also consulted scattered literary works that mention or discuss whales, as the opening ""Extracts"" section of the novel demonstrates. For instance,Thomas Browne's essay ""Of Sperma-Ceti, and the Sperma-Ceti Whale"" from hisPseudodoxia Epidemicais consulted not only in the extracts but also in the chapter titled ""Cetology"".[94]Ishmael notes: ""Many are the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne.""[95]Browne's playful examination of whales, which values philosophical interpretations over scientifically accurate examinations, helped shape the novel's style. Browne's comment on ""the [Sperm-Whale's] eyes but small, the pizell [penis] large, and prominent""[96]likely helped shape the comical chapter concerning whale penises, ""The Cassock"".CompositionArrowhead, the house inPittsfield, Massachusettswhere Melville wrote most ofMoby-Dickover the winter of 1850-1851Scholars have concluded that Melville composedMoby-Dickin two or even three stages.[97]Reasoning from biographical evidence, analysis of the functions of characters, and a series of unexplained but perhaps meaningful inconsistencies in the final version, they hypothesize that reading Shakespeare and his new friendship with Hawthorne, in the words ofLawrence Buell, inspired Melville to rewrite a ""relatively straightforward"" whaling adventure into ""an epic of cosmic encyclopedic proportions"".[98]The earliest surviving mention of what becameMoby-Dickis a letter Melville wrote toRichard Henry Dana Jr.on May 1, 1850:[99]About the ""whaling voyage""—I am half way in the work, & am very glad that your suggestion so jumps with mine. It will be a strange sort of book, tho', I fear; blubber is blubber you know; tho' you may get oil out of it, the poetry runs as hard as sap from a frozen maple tree; — & to cook the thing up, one must needs throw in a little fancy, which from the nature of the thing, must be ungainly as the gambols of the whales themselves. Yet I mean to give the truth of the thing, spite of this.[100]Bezanson objects that the letter contains too many ambiguities to assume ""that Dana's 'suggestion' would obviously be that Melville do for whaling what he had done for life on a man-of-war inWhite-Jacket"".[101]Dana had experienced how incomparable Melville was in dramatic storytelling when he met him in Boston, so perhaps ""his 'suggestion' was that Melville do a book that captured that gift"".[101]And the long sentence in the middle of the above quotation simply acknowledges that Melville is struggling with the problem, not of choosing between fact and fancy but of how to interrelate them. The most positive statements are that it will be a strange sort of a book and that Melville means to give the truth of the thing, but what thing exactly is not clear.[101]Melville may have found the plot before writing or developed it after the writing process was underway. Considering his elaborate use of sources, ""it is safe to say"" that they helped him shape the narrative, its plot included.[102]Scholars John Bryant and Haskell Springer cite the development of the character Ishmael as another factor which prolonged Melville's process of composition and which can be deduced from the structure of the final version of the book. Ishmael, in the early chapters, is simply the narrator, just as the narrators in Melville's earlier sea adventures had been, but in later chapters becomes a mystical stage manager who is central to the tragedy.[103]Less than two months after mentioning the project to Dana, Melville reported in a letter of June 27 to Richard Bentley, his English publisher:My Dear Sir, — In the latter part of the coming autumn I shall have ready a new work; and I write you now to propose its publication in England. The book is aromance of adventure, founded upon certain wild legends in the Southern Sperm Whale Fisheries, and illustrated by the author's own personal experience, of two years & more, as a harpooneer.[104]Nathaniel Hawthorne and his family had moved to a small red farmhouse nearLenox, Massachusetts, at the end of March 1850.[105]He met Melville on August 5, 1850, when the authors met at a picnic hosted by a mutual friend that included, among others,Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.andJames T. Fields.[106]Melville wrote an unsigned review of Hawthorne's short story collectionMosses from an Old Mansetitled ""Hawthorne and His Mosses"", which appeared inThe Literary Worldon August 17 and 24.[107]Bezanson finds the essay ""so deeply related to Melville's imaginative and intellectual world while writingMoby-Dick"" that it could be regarded as a virtual preface and should be ""everybody's prime piece of contextual reading"".[101]In the essay, Melville compares Hawthorne to Shakespeare and Dante, and his ""self-projection"" is evident in the repeats of the word ""genius"", the more than two dozen references to Shakespeare, and in the insistence that Shakespeare's ""unapproachability"" is nonsense for an American.[101]The most intense work on the book was done during the winter of 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm inPittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed finishing the book.[108]During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: ""What I feel most moved to write, that is banned,—it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write theotherway I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches.""[109]This is the stubborn Melville who stood byMardiand talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: ""Three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould.""[110]Buell finds the evidence that Melville changed his ambitions during writing ""on the whole convincing"", since the impact of Shakespeare and Hawthorne was ""surely monumental"",[98]but others challenge the theories of the composition in three ways. The first raises objections on the use of evidence and the evidence itself. Bryant finds ""little concrete evidence, and nothing at all conclusive, to show that Melville radically altered the structure or conception of the book""[111]and scholar Robert Milder sees ""insufficient evidence and doubtful methodology"" at work.[112]A second type of objection is based on assumptions about Melville's intellectual development. Bryant and Springer object to the conclusion that Hawthorne inspired Melville to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book; Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.[103]Bezanson is also not convinced that before he met Hawthorne, ""Melville wasnotready for the kind of bookMoby-Dickbecame"",[101]because in his letters from the time Melville denounces his last two ""straight narratives,RedburnandWhite-Jacket, as two books written just for the money, and he firmly stood byMardias the kind of book he believed in. His language is already ""richly steeped in 17th-century mannerisms"", characteristics ofMoby-Dick. A third type calls upon the literary nature of passages used as evidence. According to Milder, the cetological chapters cannot be leftovers from an earlier stage of composition and any theory that they are ""will eventually founder on the stubborn meaningfulness of these chapters"", because no scholar adhering to the theory has yet explained how these chapters ""can bear intimate thematic relation to a symbolic story not yet conceived"".[113]Buell finds that theories based on a combination of selected passages from letters and what are perceived as ""loose ends"" in the book not only ""tend to dissolve into guesswork"", but he also suggests that these so-called loose ends may be intended by the author: repeatedly the book mentions ""the necessary unfinishedness of immense endeavors"".[98]Publication historyMelville first proposed the British publication in a June 27, 1850, letter toRichard Bentley, London publisher of his earlier works. Textual scholarG. Thomas Tansellesaid that, in these earlier books, American proof sheets had been sent to the British publisher and that publication in the United States did not commence until the work had been set in type and published in England. This procedure was intended to provide the best (though still uncertain) claim for the UK copyright of an American work.[114]In the case ofMoby-Dick, Melville had taken almost a year longer than promised, and could not rely on Harpers to prepare the proofs as they had done for the earlier books. Indeed, Harpers had denied him an advance, and since he was already in debt to them for almost $700, he was forced to borrow money and to arrange for the typesetting and plating himself.[115]John Bryant suggests that he did so ""to reduce the number of hands playing with his text"".[116]The final stages of composition overlapped with the early stages of publication. At the end of May 1851, Melville delivered the bulk of his manuscript to Harper's for plating and printing of proof sheets.[117]In June, he wrote to Hawthorne that he was in New York to ""work and slave on my 'Whale' while it is driving through the press"".[118]He was staying with Allan and Sophia in a small room to correct proofs, and to (re)write the closing pages.[119]By the end of the month, ""wearied with the long delay of printers"", Melville came back to finish work on the book in Pittsfield. Three weeks later, the typesetting was almost done, as he announced to Bentley on July 20: ""I am now passing thro' the press, the closing sheets of my new work"".[118]While Melville was simultaneously writing and proofreading what had been set, the corrected proof would be plated, that is, the type fixed in final form. Since earlier chapters were already plated when he was revising the later ones, Melville must have ""felt restricted in the kinds of revisions that were feasible"".[120]On July 3, 1851, Bentley offered Melville £150 and ""half profits"", that is, half the profits that remained after the expenses of production and advertising. On July 20, Melville accepted, after which Bentley drew up a contract on August 13.[121]Melville signed and returned the contract in early September, and then went to New York with the proof sheets, made from the finished plates, which he sent to London by his brother Allan on September 10. For over a month, these proofs had been in Melville's possession, and because the book would be set anew in London he could devote all his time to correcting and revising them. He still had no American publisher, so the usual hurry about getting the British publication to precede the American was not present.[122]Only on September 12 was the Harper publishing contract signed.[123]Bentley received the proof sheets with Melville's corrections and revisions marked on them on September 24. He published the book less than four weeks later.In the October 1851 issue ofHarper's New Monthly Magazine""The Town Ho's Story"" was published, with a footnote reading: ""From 'The Whale'. The title of a new work by Mr. Melville, in the press of Harper and Brothers, and now publishing in London by Mr. Bentley.""[124]On October 18, the British edition,The Whale, was published in a printing of only 500 copies,[125]fewer than Melville's previous books. Their slow sales had convinced Bentley that a smaller number was more realistic. The LondonMorning Heraldon October 20 printed the earliest known review.[126]On November 14, the American edition,Moby-Dick, was published and the same day reviewed in both the AlbanyArgusand theMorning Courier and New-York Enquirer. On November 19, Washington received the copy to be deposited for copyright purposes. The first American printing of 2,915 copies was almost the same as the first ofMardi, but the first printing of Melville's other three Harper books had been a thousand copies more.[127]Melville's revisions and British editorial revisionsThe whale or Moby Dick (half-title page), Herman Melville, 1851The British edition, set by Bentley's printers from the American page proofs with Melville's revisions and corrections, differs from the American edition in over 700 wordings and thousands of punctuation and spelling changes.[122]Excluding the preliminaries and the one extract, the three volumes of the British edition came to 927 pages[128]and the single American volume to 635 pages.[129]Accordingly, the dedication to Hawthorne in the American edition—""this book is inscribed to""—became ""these volumes are inscribed to"" in the British.[130]The table of contents in the British edition generally follows the actual chapter titles in the American edition, but 19 titles in the American table of contents differ from the titles above the chapters themselves. This list was probably drawn up by Melville himself: the titles of chapters describing encounters of thePequodwith other ships had—apparently to stress the parallelisms between these chapters—been standardized to ""The Pequod meets the ...,"" with the exception of the already published 'The Town-Ho's Story'.[131]For unknown reasons, the ""Etymology"" and ""Extracts"" were moved to the end of the third volume.[132]An epigraph fromParadise Lost, taken from the second of the two quotations from that work in the American edition, appears on the title page of each of the three British volumes. Melville's involvement with this rearrangement is not clear: if it was Bentley's gesture toward accommodating Melville, as Tanselle suggests,[132]its selection put an emphasis on the quotation Melville might not have agreed with.The largest of Melville's revisions is the addition to the British edition of a 139-word footnote in Chapter 87 explaining the word ""gally"". The edition also contains six short phrases and some 60 single words lacking in the American edition.[133]In addition, about 35 changes produce genuine improvements, as opposed to mere corrections: ""Melville may not have made every one of the changes in this category, but it seems certain that he was responsible for the great majority of them.""[134]British censorship and missing ""Epilogue""The British publisher hired one or more revisers who were, in the evaluation of scholar Steven Olsen-Smith, responsible for ""unauthorized changes ranging from typographical errors and omissions to acts of outright censorship"".[135]According to biographer Robertson-Lorant, the result was that the British edition was ""badly mutilated"".[136]The expurgations fall into four categories, ranked according to the apparent priorities of the censor:Sacrilegious passages, more than 1,200 words: Attributing human failures to God was grounds for excision or revision, as was comparing human shortcomings to divine ones. For example, in chapter 28, ""Ahab"", Ahab stands with ""a crucifixion in his face"" was revised to ""an apparently eternal anguish"";[137]Sexual matters, including the sex life of whales and even Ishmael's worried anticipation of the nature of Queequeg's underwear, as well as allusions to fornication or harlots, and ""our hearts' honeymoon"" (in relation to Ishmael and Queequeg).[138]Chapter 95, however, ""The Cassock"", referring to the whale's genital organ, was untouched, perhaps because of Melville's indirect language.Remarks ""belittling royalty or implying a criticism of the British"": This meant the exclusion of the complete chapter 25, a ""Postscript"" on the use of sperm oil at coronations;[139]Perceived grammatical or stylistic anomalies were treated with ""a highly conservative interpretation of rules of 'correctness'"".[140]These expurgations also meant that any corrections or revisions Melville had marked upon these passages are now lost.The final difference in the material not already plated is that the ""Epilogue"", thus Ishmael's miraculous survival, is omitted from the British edition. Obviously, the epilogue was not an afterthought supplied too late for the edition, for it is referred to in ""The Castaway"": ""in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what like abandonment befell myself.""[141]Why the ""Epilogue"" is missing is unknown. Since nothing objectionable was in it, most likely it was somehow lost by Bentley's printer when the ""Etymology"" and ""Extracts"" were moved.[142]Last-minute change of titleAfter the sheets had been sent, Melville changed the title. Probably late in September, Allan sent Bentley two pages of proof with a letter of which only a draft survives which informed him that Melville ""has determined upon a new title & dedication—Enclosed you have proof of both—It is thought here that the new title will be a bettersellingtitle"". After expressing his hope that Bentley would receive this change in time, Allan said that ""Moby-Dick is a legitimate title for the book, being the name given to a particular whale who if I may so express myself is the hero of the volume"".[143]Biographer Hershel Parker suggests that the reason for the change was that Harper's had two years earlier published a book with a similar title,The Whale and His Captors.[144]Changing the title was not a problem for the American edition, since therunning headsthroughout the book only showed the titles of the chapters, and the title page, which would include the publisher's name, could not be printed until a publisher was found. In OctoberHarper's New Monthly Magazineprinted chapter 54, ""The Town-Ho's Story"", with a footnote saying: ""FromThe Whale.The title of a new work by Mr. Melville"".[143]The one surviving leaf of proof, ""a 'trial' page bearing the title 'The Whale' and the Harper imprint,""[145]shows that at this point, after the publisher had been found, the original title still stood. When Allan's letter arrived, no sooner than early October, Bentley had already announcedThe Whalein both theAthenaemand theSpectatorof October 4 and 11.[146]Probably to accommodate Melville, Bentley inserted ahalf-title pagein the first volume only, which reads ""The Whale; or, Moby Dick"".[145]Sales and earningsThe British printing of 500 copies sold fewer than 300 within the first four months. In 1852, some remaining sheets were bound in a cheaper casing, and in 1853, enough sheets were still left to issue a cheap edition in one volume. Bentley recovered only half on the £150 he advanced Melville, whose share from actual sales would have been just £38, and he did not print a new edition.[147]Harper's first printing was 2,915 copies, including the standard 125 review copies. The selling price was $1.50, about a fifth of the price of the British three-volume edition.[129]About 1,500 copies were sold within 11 days, and then sales slowed down to less than 300 the next year. After three years, the first edition was still available, almost 300 copies of which were lost when a fire broke out at the firm in December 1853. In 1855, a second printing of 250 copies was issued, in 1863, a third of 253 copies, and finally in 1871, a fourth printing of 277 copies, which sold so slowly that no new printing was ordered.[147]Moby-Dickwas out of print during the last four years of Melville's life, having sold 2,300 in its first year and a half and on average 27 copies a year for the next 34 years, totaling 3,215 copies.Melville's earnings from the book add up to $1,260: the £150 advance from Bentley was equivalent to $703, and the American printings earned him $556, which was $100 less than he earned from any of his five previous books.[148]Melville's widow received another $81 when the United States Book Company issued the book and sold almost 1,800 copies between 1892 and 1898.[148]ReceptionThe reception ofThe Whalein Britain and ofMoby-Dickin the United States differed in two ways, according to Parker. First, British literary criticism was more sophisticated and developed than in the still-young republic, with British reviewing done by ""cadres of brilliant literary people""[149]who were ""experienced critics and trenchant prose stylists"",[150]while the United States had only ""a handful of reviewers"" capable enough to be called critics, and American editors and reviewers habitually echoed British opinion.[149]American reviewing was mostly delegated to ""newspaper staffers"" or else by ""amateur contributors more noted for religious piety than critical acumen.""[150]Second, the differences between the two editions caused ""two distinct critical receptions.""[151]BritishTwenty-one reviews appeared in London, and later one in Dublin.[150]The British reviewers, according to Parker, mostly regardedThe Whaleas ""a phenomenal literary work, a philosophical, metaphysical, and poetic romance"".[5]TheMorning Advertiserfor October 24 was in awe of Melville's learning, of his ""dramatic ability for producing a prose poem"", and of the whale adventures which were ""powerful in their cumulated horrors.""[152]To its surprise,John Bullfound ""philosophy in whales"" and ""poetry in blubber"", and concluded that few books that claimed to be either philosophical or literary works ""contain as much true philosophy and as much genuine poetry as the tale of thePequod's whaling expedition"", making it a work ""far beyond the level of an ordinary work of fiction"".[153]TheMorning Postfound it ""one of the cleverest, wittiest, and most amusing of modern books"", and predicted that it was a book ""which will do great things for the literary reputation of its author"".[153]Melville himself never saw these reviews, and Parker calls it a ""bitter irony"" that the reception overseas was ""all he could possibly have hoped for, short of a few conspicuous proclamations that the distance between him and Shakespeare was by no means immeasurable.""[154]One of the earliest reviews, by the extremely conservative critic Henry Chorley[136]in the highly regarded LondonAthenaeum, described it as[A]n ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact. The idea of a connected and collected story has obviously visited and abandoned its writer again and again in the course of composition. The style of his tale is in places disfigured by mad (rather than bad) English; and its catastrophe is hastily, weakly, and obscurely managed.According to the LondonLiterary Gazette and Journal of Science and Artfor December 6, 1851, ""Mr. Melville cannot do without savages, so he makes half of hisdramatis personaewild Indians, Malays, and other untamed humanities"", who appeared in ""an odd book, professing to be a novel; wantonly eccentric, outrageously bombastic; in places charmingly and vividly descriptive"".[155]Most critics regretted the extravagant digressions because they distracted from an otherwise interesting and even exciting narrative, but even critics who did not like the book as a whole praised Melville's originality of imagination and expression.[156]Because the English edition omitted the epilogue describing Ishmael's escape, British reviewers read a book with a first-person narrator who apparently did not survive.[5]The reviewer of theLiterary Gazetteasked how Ishmael, ""who appears to have been drowned with the rest, communicated his notes to Mr. Bentley"".[155]The reviewer in theSpectatorobjected that ""nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known: thus, he must not describe the conversation of miners in a pit if theyallperish.""[157]TheDublin University Magazineasked ""how does it happen that the author is alive to tell the story?""[157]A few other reviewers, who did not comment upon the apparent impossibility of Ishmael telling the story, pointed out violations of narrative conventions in other passages.Other reviewers accepted the flaws they perceived.John Bullpraised the author for making literature out of unlikely and even unattractive matter, and theMorning Postfound that delight far outstripped the improbable character of events.[158]Though some reviewers viewed the characters, especially Ahab, as exaggerated, others felt that it took an extraordinary character to undertake the battle with the white whale. Melville's style was often praised, although some found it excessive or too American.[159]AmericanSome sixty reviews appeared in America, the criterion for counting as a review being more than two lines of comment.[160]Only a couple of reviewers expressed themselves early enough not to be influenced by news of the British reception.[149]ThoughMoby-Dickdid contain theEpilogueand so accounted for Ishmael's survival, the British reviews influenced the American reception. The earliest American review, in the BostonPostfor November 20, quoted the LondonAthenaeum's scornful review, not realizing that some of the criticism ofThe Whaledid not pertain toMoby-Dick. This last point, and the authority and influence of British criticism in American reviewing, is clear from the review's opening: ""We have read nearly one half of this book, and are satisfied that the London Athenaeum is right in calling it 'an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact'"".[161]Though thePostquoted the greater portion of the review, it omitted the condensed extract of Melville's prose theAthenaeumhad included to give readers an example of it. ThePostdeemed the price of one dollar and fifty cents far too much: ""'The Whale' is not worth the money asked for it, either as a literary work or as a mass of printed paper"".[162]The New YorkNorth American Miscellanyfor December summarized the verdict in theAthenaeum. The reviewer of the December New YorkEclectic Magazinehad actually readMoby-Dickin full, and was puzzled why theAthenaeumwas so scornful of the ending. The attack onThe Whaleby theSpectatorwas reprinted in the December New YorkInternational Magazine, which inaugurated the influence of another unfavorable review. Rounding off what American readers were told about the British reception, in JanuaryHarper's Monthly Magazineattempted some damage control, and wrote that the book had ""excited a general interest"" among the London magazines.[163]The most influential American review, ranked according to the number of references to it, appeared in the weekly magazineLiterary World, which had printed Melville's ""Mosses"" essay the preceding year. The author of the unsigned review in two installments, on November 15 and 22, was later identified as publisherEvert Duyckinck.[164]The first half of the first installment was devoted to an event of remarkable coincidence: early in the month, between the publishing of the British and the American edition, a whale had sunk the New Bedford whalerAnn Alexandernear Chile.[165]In the second installment, Duyckinck describedMoby-Dickas three books rolled into one: he was pleased with the book as far as it was a thorough account of the sperm whale, less so with it as far as the adventures of thePequodcrew were considered, perceiving the characters as unrealistic and expressing inappropriate opinions on religions, and condemned the essayistic rhapsodizing and moralizing with what he thought was little respect of what ""must be to the world the most sacred associations of life violated and defaced.""[166]The review prompted Hawthorne to take the ""unusually aggressive step of reproving Duyckinck"" by criticizing the review in a letter to Duyckinck of December 1:[167]What a book Melville has written! It gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones. It hardly seemed to me that the review of it, in the Literary World, did justice to its best points.[168]TheTranscendentalsocialistGeorge Ripleypublished a review in the New YorkTribunefor November 22, in which he compared the book favorably toMardi, because the ""occasional touches of the subtle mysticism"" was not carried on to excess but kept within boundaries by the solid realism of the whaling context.[169]Ripley was almost surely also the author of the review inHarper'sfor December, which saw in Ahab's quest the ""slight framework"" for something else: ""Beneath the whole story, the subtle, imaginative reader may perhaps find a pregnant allegory, intended to illustrate the mystery of human life.""[170]Among the handful of other favorable reviews was one in theAlbionon November 22 which saw the book as a blend of truth and satire.[171]Melville's friend Nathaniel Parker Willis, reviewing the book in November 29Home Journal, found it ""a very racy, spirited, curious and entertaining book ... it enlists the curiosity, excites the sympathies, and often charms the fancy"".[170]In December 6Spirit of the Times, editor William T. Porter praised the book, and all of Melville's five earlier works, as the writings ""of a man who is at once philosopher, painter, and poet"".[170]Some other, shorter reviews mixed their praise with genuine reservations about the ""irreverence and profane jesting"", as the New HavenDaily Palladiumfor November 17 phrased it. Many reviewers, Parker observes, had come to the conclusion that Melville was capable of producing enjoyable romances, but they could not see in him the author of great literature.[172]Reviewers who actually did read the book ""found much to praise,"" Robertson-Lorant writes, but conservative reviewers did not like it. A friend of Duyckinck's,William Allen Butler, protested in theNational Intelligenceragainst ""the querulous and cavilling innuendoes"" and the ""irreverent wit,"" while theBoston Postcalled it ""a crazy sort of affair.""[173]Legacy and adaptationsFurther information:Adaptations of Moby-DickWithin a year after Melville's death in 1891,Moby-Dick, along withTypee,Omoo, andMardi, was reprinted byHarper & Brothers, giving it a chance to be rediscovered. However, only New York's literary underground showed interest, just enough to keep Melville's name circulating for the next 25 years in the capital of American publishing. During this time, a few critics were willing to devote time, space, and a modicum of praise to Melville and his works, or at least those that could still be easily obtained or remembered. Other works, especially the poetry, went largely forgotten.[174]In 1917,American authorCarl Van Dorenbecame the first of this period to proselytize about Melville's value in his 1921 study,The American Novel, callingMoby-Dicka pinnacle of American Romanticism.[174]In his 1923Studies in Classic American Literature, novelist, poet, and short story writerD. H. Lawrencecelebrated the originality and value of American authors, among them Melville. Lawrence sawMoby-Dickas a work of the first order despite his using the expurgated original English edition, which lacked the epilogue.[174]TheModern Librarybrought outMoby-Dickin 1926, and theLakeside Pressin Chicago commissionedRockwell Kentto design and illustrate a striking three-volume edition, which appeared in 1930.Random Housethen issued a one-volume trade version of Kent's edition, which in 1943 they reprinted as a less expensive Modern Library Giant.[175]The novel has been adapted or represented in art, film, books, cartoons, television, and more than a dozen versions in comic-book format. The first adaptation was the 1926silent movieThe Sea Beast, starringJohn Barrymore,[176]in which Ahab returns to marry his fiancée after killing the whale.[177]The most famous adaptation was theJohn Huston1956 filmproduced from a screenplay by authorRay Bradbury.[178]The long list of adaptations, as Bryant and Springer put it, demonstrates that ""the iconic image of an angry embittered American slaying a mythic beast seemed to capture the popular imagination."" They conclude that ""different readers in different periods of popular culture have rewrittenMoby-Dick"" to make it a ""true cultural icon"".[177]American artistDavid Klamenhas cited the novel as an important influence on his dark, slow-to-disclose paintings, noting a passage in the book in which a mysterious, undecipherable painting in a bar is gradually revealed to depict a whale.[179]BothMystic Seaportand theNew Bedford Whaling Museumhold annual marathon live readings of Melville's novel in which volunteers read chapters aloud. The Mystic Seaport Marathon Reading is usually held July 31st to August 1st aboard the whaling vesselCharles W. Morganwith an actor portraying Herman Melville reading the first and final chapters, culminating in a celebration of Melville's birthday.[180]The 2025 New Bedford Whaling Museum Marathon was held January 3–5, 2025.[181]American authorRalph Ellisonwrote a tribute to the book in the prologue of his 1952 novelInvisible Man. The narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana and evokes a church service: ""Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most black, brother, most black ... '"" This scene, Ellison biographerArnold Rampersadobserves, ""reprises a moment in the second chapter ofMoby-Dick"", where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford looking for a place to spend the night, and momentarily joins a congregation: ""It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there."" According to Rampersad, it was Melville who ""empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition"" by his example of ""representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text"".[182]Rampersad also believes Ellison's choice of a first-person narrator was inspired above all byMoby-Dick, and the novel even has a similar opening sentence with the narrator introducing himself (""I am an invisible man"").[183]The oration by Ellison's blind preacher Barbee resembles Father Mapple's sermon in that both prepare the reader for what is to come.[184]In 1961, a Japanese author,Kōichirō Uno, won theAkutagawa Prizewith his novelThe Whale God, which was later made into atokusatsufilm byDaiei Filmnext year. Uno'sThe Whale Godwas presumably inspired byMoby-Dickas the former also focuses on vengeful whalers who seek after an unusually large and powerful whale.[185][186][187]External videosNantucket Historical Association Conference on Herman Melville, August 14, 2019,C-SPANAccording to criticCamille PagliainSexual Personae, a book with the whiteness or blankness of nonmeaning as its main symbol should logically propose a depersonalized view of nature, but in this respect the novel is ""amazingly inconsistent"", as Melville ""elevates the masculine principle above the feminine.""[188]To be perfectly consistent, in her view the whale should be ""sexually neuter,"" and its whiteness ""an obliteration of person, gender, and meaning.""[189]British explorerTim Severinwrote in his 1999 bookIn Search of Moby Dick: Quest for the White Whaleabout traveling throughout the Pacific, inquiring among indigenous fishermen and watermen about white whales, in personal experience or local folklore.American songwriterBob Dylan's Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech of 2017 citedMoby-Dickas one of the three books that influenced him most. Dylan's description ends with an acknowledgment: ""That theme, and all that it implies, would work its way into more than a few of my songs.""[190]EditionsMelville, H.,The Whale.

D. Salinger. It was partially published in serial form in 1945–46 before being novelized in 1951. Originally intended for adults, it is often read by adolescents for its themes ofangstandalienation, and as a critique ofsuperficialityin society.[4][5]The novel also deals with themes of innocence, identity, belonging, loss, connection, sex, and depression. The main character,Holden Caulfield, has become an icon for teenage rebellion.[6]Caulfield,nearly of age, gives his opinion on a wide variety of topics as he narrates his recent life events.The Catcher in the Ryehas been translated widely.[7]About one million copies are sold each year, with total sales of more than 65 million books.[8]The novel was included onTime's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923,[9]and it was named byModern Libraryand its readers as one of the100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.[10][11][12]In 2003, it was listed at number 15 on the BBC's survey ""The Big Read"".Plot[edit]Holden Caulfield recalls the events of a long weekend, shortly before the previous year's Christmas. The story begins at Pencey Preparatory Academy, an eliteboarding schoolin the fictional town of Agerstown, Pennsylvania, where he has been expelled after failing all his classes, except English.Later, Holden agrees to write an English composition for his roommate, Ward Stradlater, who is heading out on a date. He is distressed when he learns that Stradlater's date is Jane Gallagher, with whom Holden has been infatuated. When Stradlater returns, hours later, he fails to appreciate the deeply personal composition Holden has written for him about thebaseball gloveof Holden's late brother, Allie, who died fromleukemiayears earlier, and refuses to say whether he had sex with Jane. Enraged, Holden punches and insults him, but Stradlater easily wins the fight. Fed up with the ""phonies"" at Pencey Prep, Holden decides to catch a train to New York, planning to stay away from his home until Wednesday, when his parents will have received notification of his expulsion.Throughout the night, Holden has unpleasant encounters with aprostitutenamed Sunny, and herpimp, Maurice, who ends up in a physical altercation with Holden; a familiar date, Sally Hayes, who Holden invites to run away with him but is rejected; and an old classmate Carl Luce, who Holden unrelentingly questions about his sex life. Holden eventually gets drunk, awkwardly flirts with several adults, calls Sally again, and runs out of money.Nostalgic to see his younger sister Phoebe, Holden sneaks into his parents' apartment while they are out and wakes her. Though happy to see him, Phoebe quickly guesses he has been expelled and chastises him for his general aimlessness and disdain. When she asks if he cares about anything, Holden shares a fantasy (based on amishearingofRobert Burns'sComin' Through the Rye), in which he imagines himself saving children running through a field of rye by catching them before they fall off a nearby cliff. Phoebe points out that the actual poem says, ""when a body meet a body, comin' through the rye."" Holden breaks down in tears, and his sister tries to console him.As his parents return home, he slips out and visits his former English teacher, Mr. Antolini, who expresses concern that Holden is headed for ""a terrible fall"". Mr. Antolini advises him to begin applying himself and provides him with a place to sleep. Holden awakens to find Mr. Antolini patting his head, which he interprets as a sexual advance. He leaves and spends the rest of the night in a train-waiting room atGrand Central Terminal, sinking deeper into despair.In the morning, having lost hope of ever finding meaningful connection in the city, he decides to head outWestto live as a deaf-mute gas station attendant in a log cabin. He arranges to see Phoebe at lunchtime to explain his plan and say goodbye. When they meet up at theMetropolitan Museum of Art, she arrives with a suitcase and asks to go with him. Holden refuses, which upsets Phoebe. He tries to cheer her by allowing her to skip school at theCentral Park Zoo, but she remains angry. They eventually reach the carousel, where they reconcile after he buys her a ticket. The sight of her riding the carousel fills him with happiness.He alludes to encountering his parents that night, ""getting sick,"" and being sent to asanatoriumin California near his older brother, D.B. He also mentions that he will be attending another academy in September. The novel ends with Holden stating that he is reluctant to say more because talk of school has made him miss his former classmates.History[edit]Various older stories by Salinger contain characters similar to those inThe Catcher in the Rye. While atColumbia University, Salinger wrote ashort storycalled ""The Young Folks"" inWhit Burnett's class; one character from this story has been described as a ""thinly penciled prototype of Sally Hayes"". In November 1941 he sold the story ""Slight Rebellion off Madison"", which featured Holden Caulfield, toThe New Yorker, but it was not published until December 21, 1946, due toWorld War II. The story ""I'm Crazy"", which was published in the December 22, 1945 issue ofCollier's, contained material that was later used inThe Catcher in the Rye. In 1946,The New Yorkeraccepted a 90-pagemanuscriptabout Holden Caulfield for publication, but Salinger later withdrew it.[13]The school Holden attends is Pencey Preparatory Academy, aboarding schoolin Pennsylvania that Salinger may have based on theValley Forge Military Academy and College.[14]Writing style[edit]The Catcher in the Ryeis narrated in asubjectivestyle from the point of view of Holden Caulfield,following his exact thought processes. There is flow in the seemingly disjointed ideas and episodes; for example, as Holden sits in a chair in his dorm, minor events, such as picking up a book or looking at a table, unfold into discussions about experiences.Critical reviews affirm that the novel accurately reflected the teenagecolloquialspeech of the time.[15]Words and phrases that appear frequently include:[16]""Flitty"" –homosexual""Give her the time"" –sexual intercourse""Necking"" – kissing, hugging, and caressing passionately""Phony"" – people who are dishonest or fake about who they really are[17]""Prince"" – a fine, generous, helpful fellow (often used in sarcastic fashion)""Rubbernecks"" – people who turn their heads to gaze in curiosity""To shoot the bull"" – To makesmall talkto pass the time""Snowing"" – deceiving, misleading, or winning over by glib talk, flattery, etc.Interpretations[edit]Bruce Brooksheld that Holden's attitude remains unchanged at story's end, implying no maturation, thus differentiating the novel fromyoung adult fiction.[18]In contrast,Louis Menandthought that teachers assign the novel because of the optimistic ending, to teach adolescent readers that ""alienation is just a phase.""[19]While Brooks maintained that Holden acts his age, Menand claimed that Holden thinks as an adult, given his ability to accurately perceive people and their motives. Others highlight the dilemma of Holden's state, in between adolescence and adulthood.[20][21]Holden is quick to become emotional. ""I felt sorry as hell for..."" is a phrase he often uses. It is often said that Holden changes at the end, when he watches Phoebe on the carousel, and he talks about the golden ring and how it's good for kids to try to grab it.[20]Peter Beidler in hisA Reader's Companion to J. D. Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye""identified the movie that the prostitute ""Sunny"" refers to. In chapter 13 she says that in the movie a boy who looked like Holden fell off a boat, and from this detail, Beidler deduced that the movie wasCaptains Courageous(1937), with the boy played by child-actorFreddie Bartholomew.[22]Each Caulfield child has literary talent. D.B. writes screenplays in Hollywood;[23]Holden also reveres D.B. for his writing skill (Holden's own best subject), but he also despises Hollywood industry-based movies, considering them the ultimate in ""phony"" as the writer has no space for his own imagination and describes D.B.'s move to Hollywood to write for films as ""prostituting himself""; Allie wrote poetry on his baseball glove;[24]and Phoebe is a diarist.[25]This ""catcher in the rye"" is an analogy for Holden, who admires in children attributes that he often struggles to find in adults, like innocence, kindness, spontaneity, and generosity. Falling off the cliff could be a progression into the adult world that surrounds him and that he strongly criticizes. Later, Phoebe and Holden exchange roles as the ""catcher"" and the ""fallen""; he gives her his hunting hat, the catcher's symbol, and becomes the fallen as Phoebe becomes the catcher.[26]In theirbiography of Salinger,David ShieldsandShane Salernoargue that: ""The Catcher in the Ryecan best be understood as a disguisedwar novel."" Salinger witnessed the horrors of World War II, but rather than writing a combat novel, Salinger, according to Shields and Salerno, ""took the trauma of war and embedded it within what looked to the naked eye like a coming-of-age novel.""[27]In his bookRebels: Youth and the Cold War Origins of Identity,[28]Professor Leerom Medovoi posits that The Catcher in the Rye’s story is centered on identity, and that Holden Caulfield “epitomizes the triumph of the young rebel as a requisite figure for representing the national identity of America.”[28]Medovoi says that in contrast to the oppressive governance of the 1950s Soviet Union, America thought itself a plucky and rebellious player on the world stage, similar to how Holden felt in contrast with the phony adult world. Like many teens today, Holden struggles to find a balance between the adult world and the world of childhood. His desire to be “the catcher in the rye,” preventing children from falling into the symbolic death that is maturity, reflects his own fear of growing up.Reception[edit]The Catcher in the Ryehas been consistently listed as one of the best novels of the twentieth century. Shortly after its publication, in an article forThe New York Times, Nash K. Burger called it ""an unusually brilliant novel,""[3]while James Stern wrote an admiring review of the book in a voice imitating Holden's.[29]George H. W. Bushcalled it a ""marvelous book,"" listing it among the books that inspired him.[30]In June 2009, theBBC's Finlo Rohrer wrote that, 58 years since publication, the book is still regarded ""as the defining work on what it is like to be a teenager.""[31]Out of all teen demographics over the years, troubled and depressed teens seem to have a greater tendency to relate with Holden. In a 1975 interview with Robert Coles,[32]renowned child psychoanalyst Anne Freud shares her experience treating teens who readThe Catcher in the Ryefor school. “I got to know this Holden Caulfield by hearsay before I met him as a reader. My analytic patients spoke of him sometimes as if they’d actually met him; they used his words, his way of speaking. [...] I began to realize that they had taken him into their minds, and hugged him – they spoke, now, not only his words in the book (quotations from it) but his words become their own words.”[32]Adam Gopnikconsiders it one of the ""three perfect books"" in American literature, along withAdventures of Huckleberry FinnandThe Great Gatsby, and believes that ""no book has ever captured a city better thanCatcher in the Ryecaptured New York in the fifties.""[33]In an appraisal ofThe Catcher in the Ryewritten after the death of J. D. Salinger, Jeff Pruchnic says the novel has retained its appeal for many generations. Pruchnic describes Holden as a ""teenage protagonist frozen midcentury but destined to be discovered by those of a similar age in every generation to come.""[34]Bill Gatessaid thatThe Catcher in the Ryeis one of his favorite books,[35]as hasAaron Sorkin.[36]Not all reception has been positive. The book has had its share of naysayers, including the longtimeWashington Postbook criticJonathan Yardley, who, in 2004, wrote that the experience of rereading the novel after several decades proved to be ""a painful experience: The combination of Salinger'sexecrableprose and Caulfield'sjejunenarcissism produced effects comparable to mainlining castor oil."" Yardley described the novel as among the worst popular books in the annals of American literature. ""Why,"" Yardley asked, ""do English teachers, whose responsibility is to teach good writing, repeatedly and reflexively require students to read a book as badly written as this one?""[37]According to Rohrer, many contemporary readers, as Yardley found, ""just cannot understand what the fuss is about.... many of these readers are disappointed that the novel fails to meet the expectations generated by the mystique it is shrouded in. J. D. Salinger has done his part to enhance this mystique. That is to say, he has done nothing.""[31]Rohrer assessed the reasons behind both the popularity and criticism of the book, saying that it ""captures existential teenage angst"" and has a ""complex central character"" and ""accessible conversational style""; while at the same time some readers may dislike the ""use of 1940s New York vernacular"" and the excessive ""whining"" of the ""self-obsessed character"".Censorship in the United States[edit]In 1960, a teacher inTulsa, Oklahoma, was fired for assigning the novel in class. She was later reinstated.[38]Between 1961 and 1982,The Catcher in the Ryewas the mostcensoredbook in high schools and libraries in the United States.[39]The book was briefly banned in theIssaquah, Washington, high schools in 1978 when three members of the School Board alleged the book was part of an ""overall communist plot"".[40]This ban did not last long, and the offending board members were immediately recalled and removed in a special election.[41]In 1981, it was both the most censored book and the second most taught book in public schools in the United States.[42]According to theAmerican Library Association,The Catcher in the Ryewas the 10th most frequentlychallengedbook from 1990 to 1999.[10]It was one of the ten most challenged books of 2005,[43]and although it had been off the list for three years, it reappeared in the list of most challenged books of 2009.[44]The challenges generally begin with Holden's frequent use of vulgar language;[45][46]other reasons include sexual references,[47]blasphemy, undermining of family values[46]and moral codes,[48]encouragement of rebellion,[49]and promotion of drinking, smoking, lying,promiscuity, and sexual abuse.[48]The book was written for an adult audience, which often forms the foundation of many challengers' arguments against it.[50]Often the challengers have been unfamiliar with the plot itself.[39]Shelley Keller-Gage, a high school teacher who faced objections after assigning the novel in her class, noted that ""the challengers are being just like Holden... They are trying to be catchers in the rye.""[46]Censorship of the book often causes aStreisand effect, as such incidents cause many to put themselves on the waiting list to borrow the novel, where there was no waiting list before.[51][52]Violent reactions[edit]Further information:The Catcher in the Rye in popular culture § ShootingsSeveral shootings have beenassociatedwith Salinger's novel, includingRobert John Bardo's murder ofRebecca SchaefferandJohn Hinckley Jr.'sassassination attemptonRonald Reagan. Additionally, afterfatally shootingJohn Lennon,Mark David Chapmanwas arrested with a copy of the book that he had purchased that same day, inside of which he had written: ""To Holden Caulfield, From Holden Caulfield,Thisis my statement"".[53][54]Commenting on the fascination of Hinckley and Chapman, Harvey Solomon-Brady wrote:Compared to books lauded by other killers –George Orwell's1984byJohn F. Kennedy's assassinLee Harvey Oswald,C.S. Lewis's meditations on Christianity byGianni Versace's murdererAndrew CunananandJoseph Conrad'sThe Secret Agentby UnabomberTed Kaczynski–The Catcher in the Ryestands out in its devastating ability to influence without explicit instruction.[55]Attempted adaptations[edit]In film[edit]Early in his career, Salinger expressed a willingness to have his work adapted for the screen.[56]In 1949, a critically panned film version of his short story ""Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut"" was released; renamedMy Foolish Heart, the film took great liberties with Salinger's plot and is widely considered to be among the reasons that Salinger refused to allow any subsequent film adaptations of his work.[20][57]The enduring success ofThe Catcher in the Rye, however, has resulted in repeated attempts to secure the novel's screen rights.[58]WhenThe Catcher in the Ryewas first released, many offers were made to adapt it for the screen, including one fromSamuel Goldwyn, producer ofMy Foolish Heart.[57]In a letter written in the early 1950s, Salinger spoke of mounting a play in which he would play the role of Holden Caulfield oppositeMargaret O'Brien, and, if he couldn't play the part himself, to ""forget about it."" Almost 50 years later, the writerJoyce Maynarddefinitively concluded, ""The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J. D. Salinger.""[59]Salinger told Maynard in the 1970s thatJerry Lewis""tried for years to get his hands on the part of Holden,""[59]the protagonist in the novel which Lewis had not read until he was in his thirties.[51]Film industry figures includingMarlon Brando,Jack Nicholson,Ralph Bakshi,Tobey MaguireandLeonardo DiCapriohave tried to make a film adaptation.[60]In an interview withPremiere,John Cusackcommented that his one regret about turning 21 was that he had become too old to play Holden Caulfield. Writer-directorBilly Wilderrecounted his abortive attempts to snare the novel's rights:Of course I readThe Catcher in the Rye... Wonderful book. I loved it. I pursued it. I wanted to make a picture out of it. And then one day a young man came to the office ofLeland Hayward, my agent, in New York, and said, ""Please tell Mr. Leland Hayward to lay off. He's very, very insensitive."" And he walked out. That was the entire speech. I never saw him. That was J. D. Salinger and that wasCatcher in the Rye.[61]In 1961, Salinger deniedElia Kazanpermission to direct a stage adaptation ofCatcherforBroadway.[62]Later, Salinger's agents received bids for theCatcherfilm rights fromHarvey WeinsteinandSteven Spielberg, neither of which was even passed on to Salinger for consideration.[63]In 2003, theBBCtelevision programThe Big ReadfeaturedThe Catcher in the Rye, interspersing discussions of the novel with ""a series of short films that featured an actor playing J. D. Salinger's adolescent antihero, Holden Caulfield.""[62]The show defended its unlicensed adaptation of the novel by claiming to be a ""literary review"", and no major charges were filed.In 2008, the rights of Salinger's works were placed in the JD Salinger Literary Trust where Salinger was the sole trustee. Phyllis Westberg, who was Salinger's agent at Harold Ober Associates in New York, declined to say who the trustees are now that the author is dead. After Salinger died in 2010, Westberg stated that nothing had changed in terms of licensing film, television, or stage rights of his works.[64]A letter written by Salinger in 1957 revealed that he was open to an adaptation ofThe Catcher in the Ryereleased after his death. He wrote: ""Firstly, it is possible that one day the rights will be sold. Since there's an ever-looming possibility that I won't die rich, I toy very seriously with the idea of leaving the unsold rights to my wife and daughter as a kind of insurance policy. It pleasures me no end, though, I might quickly add, to know that I won't have to see the results of the transaction."" Salinger also wrote that he believed his novel was not suitable for film treatment, and that translating Holden Caulfield'sfirst-person narrativeintovoice-overand dialogue would be contrived.[65]In 2020,Don Hahnrevealed thatThe Walt Disney Companyhad almost made an animated film titledDufuswhich would have been an adaptation ofThe Catcher in the Rye""withGerman shepherds"", most likely akin toOliver & Company. The idea came from then CEOMichael Eisnerwho loved the book and wanted to do an adaptation. After being told that J. D. Salinger would not agree to sell the film rights, Eisner stated, ""Well, let's just do that kind of story, that kind of growing up, coming of age story.""[66]Banned fan sequel[edit]In 2009, the year before he died, Salinger successfully sued to stop the U.S. publication of a novel that presents Holden Caulfield as an old man.[31][67]The novel's author,Fredrik Colting, commented: ""call me an ignorant Swede, but the last thing I thought possible in the U.S. was that you banned books"".[68]The issue is complicated by the nature of Colting's book,60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye, which has been compared tofan fiction.[69]Although commonly not authorized by writers, no legal action is usually taken against fan fiction, since it is rarely published commercially and thus involves no profit.[70]Legacy and use in popular culture[edit]Main article:The Catcher in the Rye in popular cultureSee also[edit]Book censorship in the United StatesLe Monde's 100 Books of the CenturyReferences[edit]Notes[edit]^""CalArts Remembers Beloved Animation Instructor E.

Books,Lord_of_the_Flies,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies,Lord of the Flies,"1954 novel by William GoldingThis article is about the novel by William Golding. For screen adaptations, seeLord of the Flies(1963 film),Lord of the Flies(1990 film), andLord of the Flies(TV series). For other uses, seeLord of the Flies (disambiguation).Lord of the FliesThe original UKLord of the Fliesbook coverAuthorWilliam GoldingCover artistAnthony Gross[1]GenreAllegoricalnovelPublisherFaber and FaberPublication date17 September 1954Publication placeUnited KingdomPages224[2]OCLC47677622Lord of the Fliesis the 1954 debut novel of British authorWilliam Golding. The plot concerns a group of prepubescent British boys who are stranded on anuninhabited islandand their disastrous attempts to govern themselves that led to a descent into savagery. The novel's themes include morality, leadership, and the tension between civility and chaos.Lord of the Flieswas generally well received and is a popularly assigned book in schools.BackgroundPublished in 1954,Lord of the Flieswas Golding's first novel. Golding got the idea for the plot fromThe Coral Island, a children's adventure novel with a focus on Christianity and the supposed civilising influence ofBritish colonialism. Golding thought that the book was unrealistic and asked his wife whether it would be a good idea if he ""wrote a book about children on an island, children who behave in the way children really would behave?""[3]Golding, who was a philosophy teacher before becoming aRoyal Navylieutenant, experienced war firsthand and commanded a landing craft in theNormandy landings during D-Dayin 1944. After the war ended and Golding returned to England, the world was dominated byCold Warand the threat ofnuclear annihilation, which led Golding to examine the nature of humanity and that went on to inspireLord of the Flies.[4]The draft of the book was entitledStrangers from Within, which was considered ""too abstract and too explicit"".[5]The novel was rejected by many publishers before being accepted byFaber & Faber. An initial rejection labelled the book as ""absurd... Rubbish & dull"".[6]Eventually the title was changed and Golding choseLord of the Flies.[7][8]The title is a literal translation ofBeelzebub, a biblical demon considered the god of pride and warfare.[9]EditorCharles Monteithworked with Golding on several major edits, including removing the entire first section that described an evacuation fromnuclear war.[6][5]The character of Simon also was heavily edited to remove an interaction with a mysterious figure who is implied to be a god.[10]Ultimately, Golding accepted the edits, and wrote that ""I've lost any kind of objectivity I ever had over this novel and can hardly bear to look at it"".[11]The edited manuscripts are available to view at theUniversity of Exeterlibrary.[12]PlotIn the midst of a wartime evacuation, a British aeroplane crashes on an isolated island. The only survivors are boys in their middle childhood orpreadolescence. A fair-haired boy named Ralph and a fat boy nicknamed Piggy find aconchshell, which Ralph uses as a horn to gather the survivors. Ralph immediately commands authority over the other surviving boys using the conch, and is elected their ""chief"". He establishes three goals for the boys: to have fun, to survive, and to constantly maintain asmoke signalthat could alert passing ships. Ralph, a red-haired boy named Jack, and a quiet boy named Simon use Piggy's glasses to create a signal fire.The semblance of order among them deteriorates as the boys grow lazy and ignore Ralph's efforts to improve life on the island. They becomeparanoidabout an imaginary monster called ""the beast"". Ralph fails to convince the boys that no beast exists, while Jack gains popularity by declaring that he will personally hunt and kill the monster. At one point, Jack takes the boys to hunt a wild pig, including the boys who were meant to watch the signal fire. The smoke signal goes out, failing to attract a ship that was passing by the island. Ralph angrily confronts Jack and considers relinquishing his role as leader, but is persuaded not to do so by Piggy.One night, an air battle occurs near the island and the body of afighter pilotdrifts down in a parachute. Twin boys Sam and Eric mistake the corpse for the beast. When Ralph and Jack investigate with another boy, Roger, they flee in terror, believing the imaginary beast is real. Jack tries to turn the others against Ralph, and goes off alone to form his own tribe, with most of the other boys gradually joining him. Jack and his followers set up an offering to the beast in the forest: a pig's head, mounted on a sharpened stick and swarming with flies. Simon, who often ventures into the forest alone, has animaginary dialoguewith the head that he dubs the ""Lord of the Flies"". The head tells Simon that there is no beast on the island, and predicts that the other boys will turn on Simon. That night, Ralph and Piggy visit Jack's tribe, who have begun painting their faces and engaging in primitive ritual dances. When Simon realises that the beast is only a dead pilot, he rushes to tell Jack's tribe, but the frenzied boys (including Ralph and Piggy) mistake Simon for the beast and kill him.Jack and his tribe steal Piggy's glasses, the only means of starting a fire. Ralph goes to Jack's camp with Piggy, Sam, and Eric to confront Jack and retrieve the glasses. Roger drops a boulder that kills Piggy and shatters the conch in the process. Ralph manages to escape, but Sam and Eric are forced to join Jack's tribe. That night, Ralph secretly confronts Sam and Eric, who warn him that Jack plans to hunt for him. The following morning, Jack's tribe sets fire to the forest. Ralph narrowly escapes the boys and the fire, and while fleeing, falls down in front of a uniformed adult – a British naval officer who has landed on the island to investigate the fire. Ralph, Jack, and the other boys erupt into sobs over the ""end of innocence"". The officer then expresses his disappointment at seeing the boys exhibiting such feral, warlike behavior, then turns, ""moved and a little embarrassed"", to stare at hiscruiserwaiting offshore.CharactersPrimaryRalph: The athletic and charismaticprotagonistwho becomes the elected leader of the surviving boys. He is often representative of order, civilisation, and productive leadership. At the beginning of the novel, Ralph sets out to build huts and thinks of ways to improve their chances of being rescued. Ralph's influence over the boys is at first secure, but it declines as the boys defect to Jack and turn to savagery.Jack Merridew: The strong-willedantagonistwho represents savagery, violence, and power. At the beginning of the novel, he is infuriated at losing the leadership election to Ralph. He then leads his tribe, consisting of a group of ex-choir boys, into the deep forest where they hunt pigs and turn into barbarians with painted faces. By the end of the novel, he uses the boys' fear of the imaginary beast to assert control over them.Simon: An innately spiritual boy who is often the voice of reason in the midst of the rivalry between Ralph and Jack.Piggy: Ralph's intellectual and talkative friend who helps Ralph to become leader and is the source of many innovative ideas. He represents the rational side of humanity. Piggy's asthma, weight, and poor eyesight make him a target of scorn and violence. His real name is not given.Roger: An initially quiet boy who eventually becomes violent when Jack rises to power.SecondarySam and Eric: Twins, who are among Ralph's few supporters at the end of the novel. Roger forces them to join Jack's tribe.The officer: An unnamed British naval officer who commands a landing party arriving on the island at the end of the novel. The sudden appearance of an adult authority figure leads the children to instantly revert to their true age and status. However, apparently unaware of any irony, he stares at his own warship while expressing disappointment at the descent into violence by the stranded boys.ThemesThe novel's major themes are morality, civility, leadership, and the potential for rapid degeneration into chaos in society that all explore the duality of human nature.[4]Lord of the Fliesportrays a scenario in which upper-class British children quickly descend into chaos and violence without adult authority, despite attempts by some of them to establish order and co-ordination. This subverts thecolonial narrationfound in many British books of this period; for example,The Coral Island.[4]Lord of the Fliescontains various references toThe Coral Island; for example, the rescuing naval officer describing the misadventures of the boys as a ""jolly good show. Like the Coral Island.""[13]Golding's three central characters, Ralph, Piggy, and Jack, can also be interpreted as caricatures of the protagonists inThe Coral Island.[14]At anallegoricallevel, a central theme is how the desire for civilisation conflicts with thedesire for power.Lord of the Fliesalso portrays the tension betweengroupthinkand individuality, between rational and emotional reactions, and between morality and immorality. These themes have been explored in an essay by American literary criticHarold Bloom.[15]Some examples of symbolism inLord of the Fliesare the signal fire, Piggy's glasses, and the conch shell, which may be read as representing hope, reason, democracy, and unity, among other interpretations.The novel also examines aspects of war, as the story is set during awarthat has begun before the boys arrive on the island.[16]Although the location of the island is never stated, it is sometimes thought to be somewhere in thePacific Ocean, butJohn Sutherlandargues that acoral islandin theIndian Oceanis intended, based on remarks by Jack that the plane had stopped off in ""Gib"" (Gibraltar) and ""Addis"" (Addis Ababa), presumably en route to a refuge inWestern Australia. In fact, an early manuscript, entitledStrangers From Within, explicitly placed the island nearNew GuineaandBorneo.[17]Genre and styleAs a tale of adventure and survival,Lord of the Fliesfits the genre ofromanticism. It also questions human morality, making it a work ofphilosophical fiction. The novel is styled as allegorical fiction, embodying the concepts of inherent human savagery,mob mentality, andtotalitarian leadership.[18]However, Golding deviates from typical allegory in that both the protagonists and the antagonists are fully developed, realistic characters.ReceptionCritical responseIts first print run of 3,000 copies was slow to sell, butLord of the Flieswent on to become very popular, with more than ten million copies sold as of 2015.[5]E. M. ForsterchoseLord of the Fliesas his ""outstanding novel of the year"". It was described in one review as ""not only a first-rate adventure but a parable of our times"".[5]In February 1960,Floyd C. GaleofGalaxy Science FictionratedLord of the Fliesfive stars out of five, stating, ""Golding paints a truly terrifying picture of the decay of a minuscule society... Well on its way to becoming a modern classic"".[19]Marc D. HausercalledLord of the Flies""riveting"" and said that it ""should be standard reading in biology, economics, psychology, and philosophy"".[20]Lord of the Fliespresents a view of humanity unimaginable before the horrors of Nazi Europe, and then plunges into speculations about mankind in thestate of nature. Bleak and specific, but universal, fusing rage and grief,Lord of the Fliesis both a novel of the 1950s, and for all time.—Robert McCrum,The Guardian.[5]Lord of the Flieswas included on theAmerican Library Associationlist of the 100 most frequentlychallengedbooks of 1990–1999, for its controversial stance onhuman natureand individual welfare versus thecommon good.[21]The book has been criticised as cynical for portraying humanity as inherently selfish and violent. It has been linked with the essay ""The Tragedy of the Commons"" byGarrett Hardinand with books byAyn Randand countered by ""Management of the Commons"" byElinor Ostrom.[22]Lord of the Flieshas been contrasted with the historicalTongan castawaysincident from 1965, when a group of schoolboys on a fishing boat fromTongawere marooned on an uninhabited island and considered dead by their relatives. The group not only managed to survive for more than 15 months, but they ""had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens, and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade, and much determination"" according to reports. When the Tongan boys were found by a ship captain,Peter Warner, they were in good health and spirits and had developed an orderly adaptation to their stranding. When writing about the Tongan event, the Dutch historian,Rutger Bregman, said that comparing the incident to Golding's fictional portrayal made him consider theLord of the Fliesas unrealistic.[23]In a 2025PopMattersreappraisal, cultural critic Charles Switzer stated, ""That’s whyLord of the Fliesstill resonates. In an age when young people face constant pressure to conform, perform, and pick sides — whether online or in real-world social hierarchies — the breakdown on Golding’s Island feels painfully familiar. The fear of being cast out, the seduction of belonging at any cost, the ease with which violence becomes a form of power — these aren’t relics of colonial history. They’re part of the emotional architecture that today’s young people still must navigate.""[24]AwardsLord of the Flieswas awarded a place on both lists ofModern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 41 on the editor's list and 25 on the reader's list.[25]In 2003,Lord of the Flieswas listed at number 70 on theBBCsurvey,The Big Read,[26]and in 2005, it was chosen byTimemagazine as one of the 100 bestEnglish-languagenovels since 1923.[27]Timealso included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time.[28]Popular in schools, especially in the English-speaking world, a 2016 UK poll sawLord of the Fliesranked third in the nation's favourite books from school, behindGeorge Orwell'sAnimal FarmandCharles Dickens'Great Expectations.[29]In 2019,BBC NewsincludedLord of the Flieson its list of the100 most inspiring novels.[30]In other mediaFilm and televisionThree film adaptations were based on the book:Lord of the Flies(1963), directed byPeter BrookAlkitrang Dugo(1975), a Filipino film, directed by Lupita A.

It was published under her pen name ""Currer Bell"" on 19 October 1847 bySmith, Elder & Co.of London. The first American edition was published in January 1848 byHarper & Brothersof New York.[2]Jane Eyreis abildungsromanthat follows the experiences of itseponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love forMr Rochester, the brooding master ofThornfield Hall.[3]The novel revolutionisedprose fiction, being the first to focus on the moral and spiritual development of its protagonist through an intimatefirst-person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by a psychological intensity. Charlotte Brontë has been called the ""first historian of the private consciousness"" and the literary ancestor of writers such asMarcel ProustandJames Joyce.[4]The book contains elements ofsocial criticismwith a strong sense ofChristian moralityat its core, and it is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane's individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics ofclass,sexuality,religionandfeminism.[5][6]Jane Eyre, along withJane Austen'sPride and Prejudice, is one of the most famousromance novels.[7]It is considered one of the greatest novels in the English language,[8]and in 2003 was ranked as the tenth best-loved book in Britain by theBBCinThe Big Readpoll.Plot[edit]Jane Eyreis divided into 38 chapters. It was originallypublished in three volumesin the 19th century, consisting of chapters 1 to 15, 16 to 27, and 28 to 38.The second edition was dedicated toWilliam Makepeace Thackeray.The novel is a first-person narrative from the perspective of the title character. Its setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign ofGeorge III(1760–1820).[a]It has five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time asgovernessat Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. Throughout these sections it provides perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.The five stages of Jane's life are as follows:Gateshead Hall[edit]Young Jane argues with her guardian, Mrs Reed of Gateshead, illustration byF. H. TownsendJane Eyre, aged 10, lives at Gateshead Hall with her maternal uncle's family, the Reeds, as a result of her uncle's dying wish. Jane wasorphanedseveral years earlier when her parents died oftyphus. Jane's uncle, Mr Reed, was the only one in the Reed family who was kind to Jane. Jane's aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her and treats her as a burden. Mrs Reed also discourages her three children from associating with Jane. As a result Jane becomes defensive against her cruel judgement. The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane's only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly. Excluded from the family activities, Jane lives an unhappy childhood.
One day, as punishment for defending herself against the bullying of her 14-year-old cousin John, the Reeds' only son, Jane is locked in thered roomin which her late uncle had died; there she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost. The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the ""ambiguous relationship between parents and children"" which plays out in all of Jane's future relationships with male figures throughout the novel.[9]She is subsequently attended to by the kindlyapothecary, Mr Lloyd, to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall. He recommends to Mrs Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea Mrs Reed happily supports.Mrs Reed then enlists the aid of the harsh Mr Brocklehurst, the director of Lowood Institution, acharity schoolfor girls, to enroll Jane. Mrs Reed cautions Mr Brocklehurst that Jane has a ""tendency to deceit"", which he interprets as Jane being a liar. Before Jane leaves, however, she confronts Mrs Reed and declares that she'll never call her ""aunt"" again. Jane also tells Mrs Reed and her daughters, Georgiana and Eliza, that they are the ones who are deceitful, and that she will tell everyone at Lowood how cruelly the Reeds treated her. Mrs Reed is hurt badly by these words but has neither the courage nor the tenacity to show it.[10]Lowood Institution[edit]At Lowood Institution, a school for poor and orphaned girls, Jane soon finds that life is harsh. She attempts to fit in and befriends an older girl, Helen Burns. During a class session her new friend is criticised for her poor stance and dirty nails and receives a lashing as a result. Later Jane tells Helen that she could not have borne such public humiliation, but Helen philosophically tells her that it would be her duty to do so. Jane then tells Helen how badly she has been treated by Mrs Reed, but Helen tells her that she would be far happier if she did not bear grudges.In due course Mr Brocklehurst visits the school. While Jane is trying to make herself look inconspicuous, she accidentally drops herslate, thereby drawing attention to herself. She is then forced to stand on a stool and is branded a sinner and a liar. Later Miss Temple, the caring superintendent, facilitates Jane's self-defence and publicly clears her of any wrongdoing. Helen and Miss Temple are Jane's two main role models who positively guide her development despite the harsh treatment she has received from many others.The 80 pupils at Lowood are subjected to cold rooms, poor meals and thin clothing. Many students fall ill when atyphusepidemic strikes; Helen dies ofconsumptionin Jane's arms. When Mr Brocklehurst's maltreatment of the pupils is discovered, several benefactors erect a new building and install a sympathetic management committee to moderate Mr Brocklehurst's harsh rule. Conditions at the school then improve dramatically.Thornfield Hall[edit]Main article:Thornfield HallAfter six years as a pupil and two as a teacher at Lowood, Jane decides to leave in pursuit of a new life, growing bored with her life at Lowood. Her friend and confidante, Miss Temple, also leaves after getting married. Jane advertises her services as agovernessin a newspaper. The housekeeper at Thornfield Hall, Alice Fairfax, replies to Jane's advertisement. Jane takes the position, teaching Adèle Varens, a young French girl.One night, while Jane is carrying a letter to the post from Thornfield, a horseman and dog pass her. The horse slips on ice and throws the rider. Despite the rider's surliness, Jane helps him get back onto his horse. Later, back at Thornfield, she learns that this man is Edward Rochester, master of the house. Adèle was left in his care when her mother, a famous dancer, abandoned her. It is not immediately apparent whether Adèle is Rochester's daughter.At Jane's first meeting with Mr Rochester he teases her, accusing her of bewitching his horse to make him fall. Jane stands up to his initially arrogant manner. Despite his strange behaviour, Mr Rochester and Jane soon come to enjoy each other's company and they spend many evenings together.Odd things start to happen at the house, such as a strange laugh being heard, a mysterious fire in Mr Rochester's room (from which Jane saves Rochester by rousing him and throwing water on him) and an attack on a house-guest named Mr Mason.After Jane saves Mr Rochester from the fire, he thanks her tenderly and emotionally, and that night Jane feels strange emotions of her own towards him. The next day, however, he leaves unexpectedly for a distant party and several days later returns with the whole party, including the beautiful and talented Blanche Ingram. Just as she realises that she is in love with Mr Rochester, Jane sees that he and Blanche favour each other and starts to feel jealous, particularly because she also sees that Blanche is snobbish and heartless.Jane then receives word that Mrs Reed has suffered a stroke and is calling for her. Jane returns to Gateshead Hall and remains there for a month to tend to her dying aunt. Mrs Reed confesses to Jane that she wronged her, bringing forth a letter from Jane's paternal uncle, Mr John Eyre, in which he asks for her to live with him and be his heir. Mrs Reed admits to telling Mr Eyre that Jane had died of fever at Lowood. Soon afterward Mrs Reed dies, and Jane helps her cousins after the funeral before returning to Thornfield.Back at Thornfield Jane broods over Mr Rochester's rumoured impending marriage to Blanche Ingram. However one midsummer evening Rochester baits Jane by saying how much he will miss her after getting married and how she will soon forget him. The normally self-controlled Jane reveals her feelings for him. To her surprise, Rochester reciprocates, having courted Blanche only to make Jane jealous, and proposes marriage. Jane is at first sceptical of his sincerity, before accepting his proposal. She then writes to her Uncle John, telling him of her happy news.As she prepares for her wedding Jane's forebodings arise when a strange woman sneaks into her room one night and rips Jane's wedding veil in two. As with the previous mysterious events, Mr Rochester attributes the incident to Grace Poole, one of his servants. During the wedding ceremony, however, Mr Mason and a lawyer declare that Mr Rochester cannot marry because he is already married to Mr Mason's sister, Bertha. Mr Rochester admits this is true but explains that his father tricked him into the marriage for her money. Once they were united he discovered that she was rapidly descending intocongenitalmadness, and so he eventually locked her away in Thornfield, hiring Grace Poole as a nurse to look after her. When Grace gets drunk, Rochester's wife escapes and causes the strange happenings at Thornfield.It turns out that Jane's uncle, Mr John Eyre, is a friend of Mr Mason's and was visited by him soon after Mr Eyre received Jane's letter about her impending marriage. After the marriage ceremony is broken off, Mr Rochester asks Jane to go with him to thesouth of Franceand live with him as husband and wife, even though they cannot be married. Jane is tempted but realises that she will lose herself and her integrity if she allows her passion for a married man to consume her and she must stay true to her Christian values and beliefs. Refusing to go against her principles, and despite her love for Rochester, Jane leaves Thornfield Hall at dawn before anyone else is up.[11]Moor House[edit]St John Rivers admits Jane to Moor House, illustration by F. H. TownsendJane travels as far from Thornfield Hall as she can using the little money she had previously saved. She accidentally leaves her bundle of possessions on thecoachand is forced to sleep on the moor. She unsuccessfully attempts to trade her handkerchief and gloves for food. Exhausted and starving, she eventually makes her way to the home of Diana and Mary Rivers but is turned away by the housekeeper. She collapses on the doorstep, preparing for her death. Clergyman St John Rivers, Diana and Mary's brother, rescues her. After Jane regains her health, St John finds her a teaching position at a nearby village school. Jane becomes good friends with the sisters, but St John remains aloof.The sisters leave for governess jobs, and St John becomes slightly closer to Jane. St John learns Jane's true identity and astounds her by telling her that her uncle, John Eyre, has died and left her his entire fortune of 20,000pounds(equivalent to US $2.24 million in 2022[12]). When Jane questions him further, St John reveals that John Eyre is also his and his sisters' uncle. They had once hoped for a share of the inheritance but were left virtually nothing. Jane, overjoyed by finding that she has living and friendly family members, insists on sharing the money equally with her cousins, and Diana and Mary come back to live at Moor House.Proposals[edit]Thinking that the pious and conscientious Jane will make a suitablemissionary's wife, St John asks her to marry him and to go with him toIndia, not out of love, but out of duty. Jane initially accepts going to India but rejects the marriage proposal, suggesting they travel as brother and sister. As Jane's resolve against marriage to St John begins to weaken, she seems to hear Mr Rochester's voice calling her name. Jane then returns to Thornfield Hall to see if Rochester is all right, only to find blackened ruins. She learns that Rochester sent Mrs Fairfax into retirement and Adèle to school a few months following her departure. Shortly afterwards, his wife set the house on fire and died after jumping from the roof. While saving the servants and attempting to rescue his wife, Rochester lost a hand and his eyesight.Jane reunites with Rochester, and he is overjoyed at her return, but fears that she will be repulsed by his condition. ""Am I hideous, Jane?"", he asks. ""Very, sir; you always were, you know"", she replies. Now a humbled man, Rochester vows to live a purer life, and reveals that he has intensely pined for Jane ever since she left. He had even called out her name in despair one night, the very call that she heard from Moor House, and heard her reply from miles away, signifying the connection between them. Jane asserts herself as a financially independent woman and assures him of her love, declaring that she will never leave him. Rochester proposes again, and they are married. The narrator breaks thefourth walland in a famousmetafictionalmanner directly addresses the reader: ""Reader, I married him.""[13]They live blissfully together in an old house in the woods called Ferndean Manor. The couple stay in touch with Adèle as she grows up, as well as Diana and Mary, who each gain loving husbands of their own. St John moves to India to accomplish his missionary goals, but is implied to have fallen gravely ill there. Rochester regains sight in one eye two years after his and Jane's marriage, enabling him to see their newborn son.Major characters[edit]In order of first line of dialogue:Introduced in first chapter[edit]Jane Eyre:The novel's narrator and protagonist. Orphaned as a baby, Jane struggles through her nearly loveless childhood and becomes a governess at Thornfield Hall. Small and facially plain, Jane is passionate and strongly principled and values freedom and independence. She also has a strong conscience and is a determined Christian. She is ten at the beginning of the novel, and nineteen or twenty at the end of the main narrative. As the final chapter of the novel states that she has been married to Edward Rochester for ten years, she is approximately thirty at its completion.Mrs Sarah Reed(néeGibson):Jane's maternal aunt by marriage, who reluctantly adopted Jane in accordance with her late husband's wishes. According to Mrs Reed, he pitied Jane and often cared for her more than for his own children. Mrs Reed's resentment leads her to abuse and neglect the girl. She lies to Mr Brocklehurst about Jane's tendency to lie, preparing him to be severe with Jane when she arrives at Brocklehurst's Lowood School.John Reed:Jane's fourteen-year-old first cousin who bullies her incessantly and violently, sometimes in his mother's presence. Addicted to food and sweets, causing him ill health and bad complexion. John eventually ruins himself as an adult by drinking and gambling and is rumoured to have committed suicide.Eliza Reed:Jane's thirteen-year-old first cousin. Envious of her more attractive younger sister and a slave to a rigid routine, she self-righteously devotes herself to religion. She leaves for a nunnery near Lisle (France) after her mother's death, determined to estrange herself from her sister.Georgiana Reed:Jane's eleven-year-old first cousin. Although beautiful and indulged, she is insolent and spiteful. Her elder sister Eliza foils Georgiana's marriage to the wealthy Lord Edwin Vere when the couple is about to elope. Georgiana eventually marries a ""wealthy worn-out man of fashion.""Bessie Lee:The nursemaid at Gateshead Hall. She often treats Jane kindly, telling her stories and singing her songs, but she has a quick temper. Later, she marries Robert Leaven with whom she has three children.Miss Martha Abbot:Mrs Reed's maid at Gateshead Hall. She is unkind to Jane and tells Jane she has less right to be at Gateshead than a servant does.Chapters 3–5[edit]Mr Lloyd:A compassionateapothecarywho recommends that Jane be sent to school. Later, he writes a letter to Miss Temple confirming Jane's account of her childhood and thereby clears Jane of Mrs Reed's charge of lying.Mr Brocklehurst:The clergyman, director, and treasurer of Lowood School, whose maltreatment of the pupils is eventually exposed. A religious traditionalist, he advocates for his charges the most harsh, plain, and disciplined possible lifestyle, but, hypocritically, not for himself and his own family. His second daughter, Augusta, exclaimed, ""Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look… they looked at my dress and mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.""Miss Maria Temple:The kind superintendent of Lowood School, who treats the pupils with respect and compassion. She helps clear Jane of Mr Brocklehurst's false accusation of deceit and cares for Helen in her last days. Eventually, she marries Reverend Naysmith.Miss Scatcherd:A sour and strict teacher at Lowood. She constantly punishes Helen Burns for her untidiness but fails to see Helen's substantial good points.Helen Burns:Jane's best friend at Lowood School. She refuses to hate those who abuse her, trusts in God, and prays for peace one day in heaven. She teaches Jane to trust Christianity and dies of consumption in Jane's arms.Elizabeth Gaskell, in her biography of the Brontë sisters, wrote that Helen Burns was 'an exact transcript' ofMaria Brontë, who died of consumption at age 11.[14]Chapters 11–12[edit]Mrs Alice Fairfax:The elderly, kind widow and the housekeeper of Thornfield Hall; distantly related to the Rochesters.Adèle Varens:An excitable French child to whom Jane is a governess at Thornfield Hall. Adèle's mother was a dancer named Céline. She was Mr Rochester's mistress and claimed that Adèle was Mr Rochester's daughter, though he refuses to believe it due to Céline's unfaithfulness and Adèle's apparent lack of resemblance to him. Adèle seems to believe that her mother is dead (she tells Jane in chapter 11, ""I lived long ago with mamma, but she is gone to the Holy Virgin""). Mr Rochester later tells Jane that Céline actually abandoned Adèle and ""ran away to Italy with a musician or singer"" (ch. 15). Adèle and Jane develop a strong liking for one another, and although Mr Rochester places Adèle in a strict school after Jane flees Thornfield Hall, Jane visits Adèle after her return and finds a better, less severe school for her. When Adèle is old enough to leave school, Jane describes her as ""a pleasing and obliging companion—docile, good-tempered and well-principled"", and considers her kindness to Adèle well repaid.Grace Poole:""…a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face…"" Mr Rochester pays her a very high salary to keep his mad wife, Bertha, hidden and quiet. Grace is often used as an explanation for odd happenings at the house such as strange laughter that was heard not long after Jane arrived. She has a weakness for drinking that occasionally allows Bertha to escape.Edward Fairfax Rochester:The master of Thornfield Hall. AByronic hero, he has a face ""dark, strong, and stern."" He married Bertha Mason years before the novel begins.Leah:The housemaid at Thornfield Hall.Chapters 17–21[edit]Blanche Ingram:Youngsocialitewhom Mr Rochester plans to marry. Though possessing great beauty and talent, she treats social inferiors, Jane in particular, with undisguised contempt. Mr Rochester exposes her and her mother's mercenary motivations when he puts out a rumour that he is far less wealthy than they imagine.Richard Mason:An Englishman whose arrival at Thornfield Hall from the West Indies unsettles Mr Rochester. He is the brother of Rochester's first wife, the woman in the attic, and still cares for his sister's well-being. During the wedding ceremony of Jane and Mr Rochester, he exposes the bigamous nature of the marriage.Robert Leaven:The coachman at Gateshead Hall, who brings Jane the news of the death of the dissolute John Reed, an event which has brought on Mrs Reed's stroke. He informs her of Mrs Reed's wish to see Jane before she dies.Chapters 26–32[edit]Bertha Antoinetta Mason:The first wife of Edward Rochester. After their wedding, her mental health began to deteriorate, and she is now violent and in a state of intense derangement, apparently unable to speak or go into society. Mr Rochester, who insists that he was tricked into the marriage by a family who knew Bertha was likely to develop this condition, has kept Bertha locked in the attic at Thornfield Hall for years. She is supervised and cared for by Grace Poole, whose drinking sometimes allows Bertha to escape. After Richard Mason stops Jane and Mr Rochester's wedding, Rochester finally introduces Jane to Bertha: ""In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell… it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face."" Eventually, Bertha sets fire to Thornfield Hall and throws herself to her death from the roof. Bertha is viewed as Jane's ""double"": Jane is pious and just, while Bertha is savage and animalistic.[15]Though her race is never mentioned, it is sometimes conjectured that she was of mixed race. Rochester suggests that Bertha's parents wanted her to marry him, because he was of ""good race"", implying that she was not pure white, while he was. There are also references to her ""dark"" hair and ""discoloured"" and ""black"" face.[16]A number of writers during theVictorian periodsuggested that madness could result from a racially ""impure"" lineage, compounded by growing up in a tropical West Indian climate.[17][18]Diana and Mary Rivers:Sisters in a remote moors house who take Jane in when she is hungry and friendless, having left Thornfield Hall without making any arrangements for herself. Financially poor but intellectually curious, the sisters are deeply engrossed in reading the evening Jane appears at their door. Eventually, they are revealed to be Jane's cousins. They want Jane to marry their stern clergyman brother so that he will stay in England rather than journey to India as a missionary. Diana marries naval Captain Fitzjames, and Mary marries clergyman Mr Wharton. The sisters remain close to Jane and visit her and Rochester every year.Hannah:The kindly housekeeper at the Rivers home; ""…comparable with the Brontës' well-loved servant, Tabitha Aykroyd.""St John Eyre Rivers:A handsome, though severe and serious, clergyman who befriends Jane and turns out to be her cousin. St John is thoroughly practical and suppresses all of his human passions and emotions, particularly his love for the beautiful and cheerful heiress Rosamond Oliver, in favour of good works. He wants Jane to marry him and serve as his assistant on his missionary journey to India. After Jane rejects his proposal, St John goes to India unmarried.Rosamond Oliver:A beautiful, kindly, wealthy, but rather simple young woman, and the patron of the village school where Jane teaches. Rosamond is in love with St John, but he refuses to declare his love for her because she would not be suitable as a missionary's wife. She eventually becomes engaged to the respected and wealthy Mr Granby.Mr Oliver:Rosamond Oliver's wealthy father, who owns a foundry and needle factory in the district. ""…a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret."" He is a kind and charitable man, and he is fond of St John.Context[edit]The Salutation pub inHulme, Manchester, where Brontë began to writeJane Eyre; the pub was a lodge in the 1840s.[19][20]The early sequences, in which Jane is sent to Lowood, a harshboarding school, are derived from the author's own experiences. Helen Burns's death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Brontë's sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as a result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School atCowan Bridge, nearTunstall, Lancashire. Mr Brocklehurst is based on Rev.William Carus Wilson(1791–1859), the Evangelical minister who ran the school. Additionally, John Reed's decline intoalcoholismand dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte's brotherBranwell, who became anopiumand alcohol addict in the years preceding his death. Finally, like Jane, Charlotte became a governess. These facts were revealed to the public inThe Life of Charlotte Brontë(1857) by Charlotte's friend and fellow novelistElizabeth Gaskell.[21]The Gothic manor of Thornfield Hall was probably inspired by North Lees Hall, nearHathersagein thePeak Districtin Derbyshire. This was visited by Charlotte Brontë and her friendEllen Nusseyin the summer of 1845, and is described by the latter in a letter dated 22 July 1845. It was the residence of the Eyre family, and its first owner, Agnes Ashurst, was reputedly confined as a lunatic in a padded second floor room.[21]It has been suggested that theWycoller Hallin Lancashire, close to Haworth, provided the setting for Ferndean Manor to which Mr Rochester retreats after the fire at Thornfield: there are similarities between the owner of Ferndean—Mr Rochester's father—and Henry Cunliffe, who inherited Wycoller in the 1770s and lived there until his death in 1818; one of Cunliffe's relatives was named Elizabeth Eyre (née Cunliffe).[22]The sequence in which Mr Rochester's wife sets fire to the bed curtains was prepared in an August 1830 homemade publication of Brontë'sThe Young Men's Magazine, Number 2.[23]Charlotte Brontë began composingJane Eyrein Manchester, and she likely envisionedManchester Cathedralchurchyard as the burial place for Jane's parents and Manchester as the birthplace of Jane herself.[24]Adaptations and influence[edit]Main article:Adaptations of Jane EyreAdvertisement for a theatre adaptation ofJane Eyre, 1908The novel has been adapted into a number of other forms, including theatre, film, television, and at least three full-length operas. The novel has also been the subject of a number of significant rewritings and related interpretations, notablyJean Rhys's seminal 1966 novelWide Sargasso Sea.[25]A famous line in the book is at the beginning of Chapter 38: ""Reader, I married him."" Many authors have used a variation of this line in their work. For example,Liane Moriartydiscussed and used the line in her 2018 novelNine Perfect Strangers.[26]The bookReader, I Married Him: Stories inspired by Jane Eyre, a 2016 anthology of short stories, edited byTracy Chevalier, was also inspired by this line. It was commissioned to mark the 200th anniversary of Brontë's birth, and is published byThe Borough Press, an imprint ofHarperCollins.[27][28][29][30][31]Thai novelRuk Diow Kong Jenjirawas adapted by Nida in 1993. In 1996, it was made into atelevision dramaonChannel 3starred byWillie McIntoshand Sirilak Pongchoke.[32]The novelThe French Dancer's Bastard, byEmma Tennant, reimagines the back story of Adèle, exploring whether she was Rochester's love child and what her relationship with Jane Eyre is.[33]The most recent film adaptation,Jane Eyre, was released in 2011, directed byCary Joji Fukunaga, and starredMia Wasikowskaas Jane Eyre andMichael Fassbenderas Mr. Rochester. The film, actors, and costume design team were nominated and won various awards from 2011 to 2012.[34][35]Reception[edit]Contemporary reviews[edit]Jane Eyre's initial reception contrasts starkly to its reputation today. In 1848, Elizabeth Rigby (laterElizabeth Eastlake), reviewingJane EyreinThe Quarterly Review, found it ""pre-eminently an anti-Christian composition,""[36]declaring: ""We do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought which has overthrown authority and violated every code human and divine abroad, and fosteredChartismand rebellion at home, is the same which has also writtenJane Eyre.""[36]An anonymous review inThe Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instructionwrites of ""the extraordinary daring of the writer ofJane Eyre""; however, the review is mostly critical, summarising: ""There is not a single natural character throughout the work. Everybody moves on stilts—the opinions are bad—the notions absurd. Religion is stabbed in the dark—our social distinctions attempted to be levelled, and all absurdly moral notions done away with.""[37]There were some who felt more positive about the novel contemporaneously.George Henry Lewessaid, ""It reads like a page out of one's own life; and so do many other pages in the book.""[38]Another critic from theAtlaswrote, ""It is full of youthful vigour, of freshness and originality, of nervous diction and concentrated interest ...It is a book to make the pulses gallop and the heart beat, and to fill the eyes with tears.""[39]A review inThe Erapraised the novel, calling it ""an extraordinary book"", observing that ""there is much to ponder over, rejoice over, and weep over, in its ably-written pages. Much of the heart laid bare, and the mind explored; much of greatness in affliction, and littleness in the ascendant; much of trial and temptation, of fortitude and resignation, of sound sense and Christianity—but no tameness.""[40]The People's Journalcompliments the novel's vigour, stating that ""the reader never tires, never sleeps: the swell and tide of an affluent existence, an irresistible energy, bears him onward, from first to last. It is impossible to deny that the author possesses native power in an uncommon degree—showing itself now in rapid headlong recital, now in stern, fierce, daring dashes in portraiture—anon in subtle, startling mental anatomy—here in a grand illusion, there in an original metaphor—again in a wild gush of genuine poetry.""[41]American publicationThe Nineteenth Centurydefended the novel against accusations of immorality, describing it as ""a work which has produced a decided sensation in this country and in England...Jane Eyrehas made its mark upon the age, and even palsied the talons of mercenary criticism. Yes, critics hired to abuse or panegyrize, at so much per line, have felt a throb of human feeling pervade their veins, at the perusal ofJane Eyre. This is extraordinary—almost preternatural—smacking strongly of the miraculous—and yet it is true... We have seenJane Eyreput down, as a work of gross immorality, and its author described as the very incarnation of sensualism. To any one, who has read the work, this may look ridiculous, and yet it is true.""[42]The Indicator, concerning speculation regarding the gender of the author, wrote, ""We doubt not it will soon cease to be a secret; but on one assertion we are willing to risk our critical reputation—and that is, that no woman wrote it. This was our decided conviction at the first perusal, and a somewhat careful study of the work has strengthened it. No woman in all the annals of feminine celebrity ever wrote such a style, terse yet eloquent, and filled with energy bordering sometimes almost on rudeness: no woman ever conceived such masculine characters as those portrayed here.""[43]Twentieth century[edit]Literary critic Jerome Beaty believed the close first-person perspective leaves the reader ""too uncritically accepting of her worldview"", and often leads reading and conversation about the novel towards supporting Jane, regardless of how irregular her ideas or perspectives are.[44]In 2003, the novel was ranked number 10 in theBBC's surveyThe Big Read.[45]Genres[edit]Romance[edit]Further information:Romance (literary fiction)Before theVictorian era,Jane Austenwroteliterary fictionthat influenced laterpopular fiction, as did the work of theBrontë sistersproduced in the 1840s. Brontë's loveromanceincorporates elements of both thegothic novelandElizabethan drama, and ""demonstrate[s] the flexibility of the romance novel form.""[46]Gothic[edit]Bertha Mason, illustrated byEdmund H. GarrettTheGothic genreuses a combination of supernatural features, intense emotions, and a blend of reality and fantasy to create a dark, mysterious atmosphere and experience for characters and readers. Jane Eyre is a homodiegetic narrator, which allows her to exist both as a character and narrator in the story world, and her narration establishes an emotional connection and response for the reader.[47]This intentional, narrative technique works in tandem with Gothic features and conventions. Jane and the reader are unaware of the cause behind the ""demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep"" or ""a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall,"" though the reason comes from Bertha Mason. The element of the unknown works in conjunction to the possibility of the supernatural. The intensity of emotions and reactions to Gothic conventions can solely exist in the protagonist's imagination. Instances that a protagonist interprets to be their imagination turns into reality. Jane's experience in the red room represents an aspect of Gothic conventions as Jane feels fear towards being punished in the red room because she believes and imagines that her dead uncle haunts the room.The Gothic genre uses theGothic double: a literary motif, which is described as the protagonist having a double, alter ego, ordoppelgängerinterpreted between Jane Eyre and Bertha Mason, where Bertha represents the other side of Jane and vice versa.[48]The commonly used Gothic literary device,foreshadowing, creates an environment filled with tension, ominousity, and dread. After Jane agrees to marry Rochester, a horse-chestnut tree in an orchard is struck by lightning, splitting the tree in half. The lightning strike is ominous and foreshadows Jane and Rochester's separation.The Gothic Genre in tandem with Murphy's the ""New Woman Gothic"" establishes an opportunity to go against the Romantic's concept that the antagonist is usually a villainous father.[49]The Gothic genre allows there to be a complex consideration of who or what hinders Jane's happiness. The barriers Jane experiences, whether related to social class, societal and cultural norms, Bertha Mason, or Rochester, have antagonistic elements.Bildungsroman[edit]TheBildungsromanrepresentation inJane Eyreuses romantic elements that emphasise the journey of one pursuing the discovery of one's identity and knowledge.[50]Jane Eyre desires the thrill and action that comes from being an active individual in society, and she refuses to allow the concept of gender and class to hinder her.Bildungsroman was primarily viewed through male life progression, but feminist scholars have worked to counteract the male norm of bildungsroman by including female development.[51]Experiences that deem a female narrative to be bildungsroman would be the female protagonist discovering how to manage living in a restrictive society.[52]The novel's setting is the English society of the early 19th century, and with that time setting come specific restrictions women encountered during that time, such as the law ofcoverture, the lack of rights, and the restricted expectations placed on women. Jane Eyre does not specifically and directly deal with the restrictions of, for example coverture, but her character lives in a society where coverture exists, which inadvertently impacts social and cultural norms and expectations. Progression in the bildungsroman does not necessarily occur in a linear direction. Many narratives that employ bildungsroman do so through the protagonist's development of maturity, which is represented through the protagonist's experiences from childhood to adulthood; this progression is in conjunction with the novel's narrative technique set as anautobiography. Temporally, the beginning of the novel begins with Jane at age ten and ends with Jane at age thirty, but Jane's development of maturity goes beyond her age. For example, Jane's emotional intelligence grows through her friendship with Helen Burns as Jane experiences and processes the loss of her friendship with Helen.Many times, the 19th-century female bildungsroman can be interpreted as the heroine's growth of self and education in the context of prospective marriage, especially when, in the context of 19th-century womanhood, a wife experiences new knowledge in the private sphere of her role. Jane develops knowledge and experience regarding a romantic journey before her almost marriage to Mr. Rochester; a physical, spiritual, and financial knowledge during her time with St. John; and lastly, with her marriage with Mr. Rochester at the end of the novel.[53]Jane's search for excitement and understanding of life goes beyond her romantic journey.[54]In the text, Jane's childhood beliefs about religion, as seen in her interactions with Mr. Brocklehurt, shift considerably in comparison to her friendship with Helen in Lowood as a child and in her marital and missionary rejection of St. John as an adult woman.Themes[edit]Race[edit]Throughout the novel there are frequent themes relating to ideas ofethnicity(specifically that of Bertha), which are a reflection of the society that the novel is set within. Mr Rochester claims to have been forced to take on a ""mad"" Creole wife, a woman who grew up in theWest Indies, and who is thought to be ofmixed-racedescent.[55]In the analysis of several scholars, Bertha plays the role of the racialised ""other"" through the shared belief that she chose to follow in the footsteps of her parents. Her apparent mental instability cast her as someone who is incapable of restraining herself, almost forced to submit to the different vices she is a victim of.[55]Many writers of the period believed that one could develop mental instability or mental illnesses simply based on their race.[56]This means that those who were born of ethnicities associated with a darker complexion, or those who were not fully of European descent, were believed to be more mentally unstable than their white European counterparts were. According to American scholar Susan Meyer, in writingJane EyreBrontë was responding to the ""seemingly inevitable"" analogy in 19th-century European texts which ""[compared] white women with blacks in order to degrade both groups and assert the need for white male control"".[57]Bertha serves as an example of both the multiracial population and of a 'clean' European, as she is seemingly able to pass as a white woman for the most part, but also is hinted towards being of an 'impure' race since she does not come from a purely white or European lineage. The title that she is given by others of being a Creole woman leaves her a stranger where she is not black but is also not considered to be white enough to fit into higher society.[58]Unlike Bertha, Jane Eyre is thought of as being sound of mind before the reader is able to fully understand the character, simply because she is described as having a complexion that is pale and she has grown up in a European society rather than in an ""animalistic"" setting like Bertha.[18]Jane is favoured heavily from the start of her interactions with Rochester, simply because like Rochester himself, she is deemed to be of a superior ethnic group than that of his first wife. While she still experiences some forms of repression throughout her life (the events of the Lowood Institution) none of them are as heavily taxing on her as that which is experienced by Bertha. Both women go through acts of suppression on behalf of the men in their lives, yet Jane is looked at with favour because of her supposed ""beauty"" that can be found in the colour of her skin. While both are characterised as falling outside of the normal feminine standards of this time, Jane is thought of as superior to Bertha because she demands respect and is able to use her talents as a governess, whereas Bertha is seen as a creature to be confined in the attic away from ""polite"" society.[59]Scholars have also noted the novel's overt references and allusions to slavery, arguably its North American iteration.[60]Wide Sargasso Sea[edit]Jean Rhys intended her critically acclaimed novelWide Sargasso Seaas an account of the woman whom Rochester married and kept in his attic. The book won the notableWH Smith Literary Awardin 1967. Rhys explores themes of dominance and dependence, especially in marriage, depicting the mutually painful relationship between a privileged English man and aCreolewoman fromDominicamade powerless on being duped and coerced by him and others. Both the man and the woman enter marriage under mistaken assumptions about the other partner. Her female lead marries Mr Rochester and deteriorates in England as ""The Madwoman in the Attic"". Rhys portrays this woman from a quite different perspective from the one inJane Eyre.Feminism[edit]The idea of the equality of men and women emerged more strongly in theVictorian periodin Britain, after works by earlier writers, such asMary Wollstonecraft. R. B. Martin describedJane Eyreas the first major feminist novel, ""although there is not a hint in the book of any desire for political, legal, educational, or even intellectual equality between the sexes."" This is illustrated in chapter 23, when Jane responds to Rochester's callous and indirect proposal:Do you think I am an automaton? a machine without feelings?...Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong—I have as much soul as you,—and full as much heart...I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,—as we are.[61][62]The novel ""acted as a catalyst"" to feminist criticism with the publication by S. Gilbert and S. Gubar'sThe Madwoman in the Attic(1979), the title of which alludes to Rochester's wife.[63]The Brontës' fictions were cited by feminist criticEllen Moersas prime examples of Female Gothic, exploring woman's entrapment within domestic space and subjection to patriarchal authority, and the transgressive and dangerous attempts to subvert and escape such restriction.[64]BothWuthering HeightsandJane Eyreexplore this theme.[65]Social class[edit]Throughout the novel, Jane undergoes various social class transitions, in response to her life's varying situations.[66]As a child, she mixes with middle class people through the Reed family, though Jane is not at the same level of social class as the rest of the Reed family. While at Lowood, she experiences the life of children whose guardians can afford the school fees of ""fifteen pounds per year"" but nonetheless are ""charity children"" ""because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching"", living in poor conditions, and later working there as an adult as a teacher on a salary of fifteen pounds. She has an opportunity to be a private governess, and in so doing double her salary, but her governess position makes her aware of her ambiguous social position as a governess to a child with a wealthy guardian.[67]After Jane leaves Thornfield Hall, she is stripped of her class identity as she travels across the moors and arrives at Moor House. But Jane receives an inheritance which she shares with her new-found family, and this offers a different form of independence.Notes[edit]^The exact time setting of the novel is impossible to determine, as several references in the text are contradictory. For exampleMarmion(pub. 1808) is referred to in Chapter 32 as a ""new publication"", but Adèle mentions crossing the Channel by steamship, impossible before 1816.References[edit]^""On Tuesday next will be published, and may be had at all the libraries, Jane Eyre.

It concerns two families of thelanded gentryliving on theWest Yorkshiremoors, the Earnshaws and the Lintons, and their turbulent relationships with the Earnshaws' foster son,Heathcliff. The novel, influenced byRomanticismandGothic fiction, is considered a classic ofEnglish literature.Wuthering Heightswas accepted by publisher Thomas Newby along withAnne Brontë'sAgnes Greybefore the success of their sisterCharlotte Brontë's novelJane Eyre, but they were published later. The first American edition was published in April 1848 byHarper & Brothersof New York.[2]After Emily's death, Charlotte edited a second edition ofWuthering Heights, which was published in 1850.[3]Though contemporaneous reviews were polarised,Wuthering Heightshas come to be considered one of the greatest novels written in English. It was controversial for its depictions of mental and physical cruelty, includingdomestic abuse, and for its challenges toVictorian morality, religion, and theclass system.[4][5]It has inspired an array ofadaptationsacross several media, including English singer-songwriterKate Bush's song ""Wuthering Heights"".Plot[edit]Opening[edit]In 1801,Mr Lockwood, the new tenant at Thrushcross Grange inYorkshire, pays a visit to his landlord,Heathcliff, at his remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There he meets a reserved young woman (later identified as Cathy Linton), Joseph, a cantankerous servant, and Hareton, an uneducated young man who speaks like a servant. Everyone is sullen and inhospitable. Snowed in for the night, Lockwood reads the diary of the former inhabitant of his room, Catherine Earnshaw, and has a nightmare in which a ghostly Catherine begs to enter through the window. Awakened by Lockwood's fearful yells, Heathcliff is troubled.Lockwood later returns to Thrushcross Grange in heavy snow, falls ill from the cold and becomes bedridden. While he recovers, Lockwood's housekeeper Ellen ""Nelly"" Dean tells him the story of the strange family.Nelly's tale[edit]Thirty years earlier, the Earnshaws live at Wuthering Heights with their two children, Hindley and Catherine, and a servant—Nelly herself. Returning from a trip toLiverpool, Earnshaw brings home an orphan whom he names Heathcliff. Heathcliff's origins are unclear but he is described as ""like a gipsy"" and possibly, aLascaror an American or Spanish castaway.[6]Earnshaw treats the boy as his favourite. His own children he neglects, especially after his wife dies. Hindley beats Heathcliff, who gradually becomes close friends with Catherine.Hindley departs for university, returning as the new master of Wuthering Heights on the death of his father three years later. He and his new wife Frances force Heathcliff to live as one of their servants and subject him to much verbal and emotional abuse.The climb to ruined farmhouseTop Withens, thought to have inspired the Earnshaws' home inWuthering HeightsEdgar Linton and his sister Isabella live nearby at Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff and Catherine spy on them out of curiosity. When Catherine is attacked by their dog, the Lintons take her in, but send Heathcliff home. The Lintons visit, and Hindley and Edgar make fun of Heathcliff; a fight ensues. Heathcliff is then made to live in the manor's unheated, dusty attic and swears that he will one day have his revenge.Frances dies after giving birth to a son, Hareton. Two years later, Catherine becomes engaged to Edgar. She confesses to Nelly that she loves Heathcliff, and will try to help him, but feels she cannot marry him because of his low social status. Nelly warns her against associating with a man like Heathcliff. Heathcliff overhears part of the conversation and, misunderstanding Catherine's heart, flees the household. Distraught, Catherine falls ill.Three years after his departure, with Edgar and Catherine now wed and expecting children, Heathcliff unexpectedly returns, now a wealthy gentleman. He encourages Isabella's infatuation with him as a means of revenge on Catherine. Enraged by Heathcliff's constant presence at Thrushcross Grange, Edgar banishes him. Catherine responds by locking herself in her room and refusing food; she never fully recovers. At Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff exploits Hindley'sgamblingaddiction and compels him to mortgage the estate to cover his losses. Heathcliff elopes with Isabella, but the relationship fails and they soon return.When Heathcliff discovers that Catherine is dying, he visits her in secret. She dies shortly after giving birth to a daughter,Cathy, and Heathcliff rages, calling on her ghost to haunt him for as long as he lives. Isabella, bitter over Heathcliff's devotion to a dead woman, flees south where she gives birth to Heathcliff's son, a sickly boy named Linton. Hindley dies six months later ofalcoholism, and Heathcliff then takes possession of Wuthering Heights as its new master.Twelve years later, after Isabella's death, the still-sickly Linton is brought back to live with his uncle Edgar at the Grange, but Heathcliff insists that his son must instead live with him. Cathy and Linton (respectively at the Grange and Wuthering Heights) gradually develop a relationship. Heathcliff schemes to ensure that they marry in order to ensure his claim to Thrushcross Grange, and on Edgar's death demands that the couple move in with him. He becomes increasingly wild and reveals that on the night Catherine died he dug up her grave, and ever since has been plagued by her ghost. When Linton unexpectedly dies, Cathy has no option but to remain at Wuthering Heights.Having reached the present day, Nelly's tale concludes.Ending[edit]Lockwood grows tired of the moors and moves away. Eight months later he returns for a visit, and Nelly, now the housekeeper at Wuthering Heights, tells him what has happened since he left.Heathcliff gave up his opposition to Cathy and Hareton's union. He declined physically and started seeing visions of the dead Catherine; he avoided the young couple, saying that he could not bear to see Catherine's eyes, which they both shared, looking at him. He eventually stopped eating, and some days later was found dead in Catherine's old room.Cathy has been teaching the still-uneducated Hareton to read. They plan to marry and move to the Grange, accompanied by Nelly, with Joseph being left to take care of Wuthering Heights. Nelly reports that the locals have seen the ghosts of Catherine and Heathcliff wandering abroad together. Lockwood seeks out the graves of Catherine, Edgar, and Heathcliff, and is convinced that all three are finally at peace.Family tree[edit]Mrs EarnshawMr EarnshawMrs LintonMr LintonFrancesHindley EarnshawCatherine EarnshawEdgar LintonIsabella LintonHeathcliffHareton Earnshawm. 1803Cathy LintonLinton Heathcliffm. 1801Characters[edit]Heathcliff: Afoundlingfrom Liverpool, who is taken by Earnshaw to Wuthering Heights, where he is reluctantly cared for by the family and spoiled by his adoptive father. He and Mr. Earnshaw's daughter, Catherine, grow close, and their love is the central theme of the first volume. His revenge against the man she chooses to marry and its consequences are the central theme of the second volume. Heathcliff has been considered aByronic hero, but critics have pointed out that he reinvents himself at various points, making his character hard to fit into any single type. He has an ambiguous position in society, and his lack of status is underlined by the fact that ""Heathcliff"" is both his given name and his surname. The character of Heathcliff may have been inspired byBranwell Brontë. An alcoholic and an opium addict, he would have indeed terrorised Emily and her sister Charlotte during frequent crises ofdelirium tremensthat affected him a few years before his death. Even though Heathcliff has no alcohol or drug problems, the influence of Branwell's character is likely; although the same could be said, perhaps more appropriately, of Hindley Earnshaw and Linton Heathcliff.[7]Catherine Earnshaw: First introduced to the reader after her death, through Lockwood's discovery of her diary and carvings. The description of her life is confined almost entirely to the first volume. She seems unsure whether she is, or wants to become, more like Heathcliff, or aspires to be more like Edgar. Some critics have argued that her decision to marry Edgar Linton is allegorically a rejection of nature and a surrender to culture, a choice with unfortunate, fateful consequences for all the other characters.[8]She dies hours after giving birth to her daughter.Edgar Linton: Introduced as a child in the Linton family, he resides at Thrushcross Grange. Edgar's style and manners are in sharp contrast to those of Heathcliff, who instantly dislikes him, and of Catherine, who is drawn to him. Catherine marries him instead of Heathcliff because of his higher social status, with disastrous results to all characters in the story. He dotes on his wife and later his daughter.Ellen (Nelly) Dean: The main narrator of the novel, Nelly is a servant to three generations of the Earnshaws and two of the Linton family. Humbly born, she regards herself nevertheless as Hindley's foster-sister (they are the same age and her mother is his nurse). She lives and works among the rough inhabitants of Wuthering Heights but is well-read, and she also experiences the more genteel manners of Thrushcross Grange. She is referred to as Ellen, her given name, to show respect, and as Nelly among those close to her. Critics have discussed how far her actions as an apparent bystander affect the other characters and how much her narrative can be relied on.[9]In ""The Villain inWuthering Heights"" (1958) James Hafley argues that Nelly seems to be the moral centre of the novel only because of the instability and violence of the world she describes. In his view, she is the true villain of the novel, as she drives the majority of the conflicts, and Lockwood's faith in her story is a sign of his innocence.[9]Isabella Linton: Edgar's sister. She views Heathcliff romantically, despite Catherine's warnings, and becomes an unwitting participant in his plot for revenge against Edgar. Heathcliff marries her but treats her abusively. While pregnant, she escapes to London and gives birth to a son, Linton. She entrusts her son to her brother Edgar when she dies.Hindley Earnshaw: Catherine's elder brother, Hindley, despises Heathcliff immediately and bullies him throughout their childhood before his father sends him away to college. Hindley returns with his wife, Frances, after Mr Earnshaw dies. He is more mature, but his hatred of Heathcliff remains the same. After Frances's death, Hindley reverts to destructive behaviour, neglects his son, and ruins the Earnshaw family by drinking and gambling to excess. Heathcliff beats Hindley up at one point after Hindley fails in his attempt to kill Heathcliff with a pistol. He dies less than a year after Catherine and leaves his son with nothing.Hareton Earnshaw: The son of Hindley and Frances, raised at first by Nelly but soon by Heathcliff. Joseph works to instill a sense of pride in the Earnshaw heritage (even though Hareton will not inherit Earnshaw's property, because Hindley has mortgaged it to Heathcliff). Heathcliff, in contrast, teaches him vulgarities as a way of avenging himself on Hindley. Hareton speaks with an accent similar to Joseph's, and occupies a position similar to that of a servant at Wuthering Heights, unaware that he has been done out of his inheritance. He can only read his name. In appearance, he reminds Heathcliff of his aunt, Catherine.Catherine ""Cathy"" Linton: The daughter of Catherine and Edgar Linton, a spirited and strong-willed girl unaware of her parents' history. Edgar is very protective of her and as a result, she is eager to discover what lies beyond the confines of the Grange. Although one of the more sympathetic characters of the novel, she is also somewhat snobbish towards Hareton and his lack of education. She is forced to marry Linton Heathcliff, but after he dies she falls in love with Hareton and they marry.Linton Heathcliff: The son of Heathcliff and Isabella. A weak child, his early years are spent with his mother in the south of England. He learns of his father's identity and existence only after his mother dies when he is twelve. In his selfishness and capacity for cruelty he resembles Heathcliff; physically, he resembles his mother. He marries Cathy Linton because his father, who terrifies him, directs him to do so, and soon after he dies from a wasting illness associated withtuberculosis.Joseph: A servant at Wuthering Heights for 60 years who is a rigid, self-righteous Christian but lacks any trace of genuine kindness or humanity. He hates nearly everyone in the novel. The Yorkshire dialect that Joseph speaks was the subject of a 1970 book by the linguistK.M. Petyt, who argued that Emily Brontë recorded the dialect of Haworth accurately.[10]Mr Lockwood: The first narrator, he rents Thrushcross Grange to escape society, but in the end, decides society is preferable. He narrates the book until Chapter 4, when the main narrator, Nelly, picks up the tale.Frances: Hindley's ailing wife and mother of Hareton Earnshaw. She is described as somewhat silly and is obviously from a humble family. Frances dies not long after the birth of her son.Mr and Mrs Earnshaw: Catherine's and Hindley's father, Mr Earnshaw is the master of Wuthering Heights at the beginning of Nelly's story and is described as an irascible but loving and kind-hearted man. He favours his adopted son, Heathcliff, which causes trouble in the family. In contrast, his wife mistrusts Heathcliff from their first encounter.Mr and Mrs Linton: Edgar's and Isabella's parents, they bring up their children to be well-behaved and sophisticated. Mr Linton also serves as the magistrate of Gimmerton, as his son does in later years.Dr Kenneth: The longtime doctor of Gimmerton and a friend of Hindley's who is present at the cases of illness during the novel. Although not much of his character is known, he seems to be a rough but honest person.Zillah: A servant to Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights during the period following Catherine's death. Although she is kind to Lockwood, she doesn't like or help Cathy at Wuthering Heights because of Cathy's arrogance and Heathcliff's instructions.Mr Green: Edgar's corruptible lawyer who should have changed Edgar's will to prevent Heathcliff from gaining Thrushcross Grange. Instead, Green changes sides and helps Heathcliff to inherit the Grange as his property.Publication history[edit]1847 edition[edit]The original text as published by Thomas Cautley Newby in 1847 is available online in two parts.[11]The novel was first published together with Anne Brontë'sAgnes Greyin athree-volume format:Wuthering Heightsfilled the first two volumes andAgnes Greymade up the third.1850 edition[edit]In 1850 Charlotte Brontë edited the original text for the second edition ofWuthering Heightsand also provided it with her foreword.[12]She addressed the faulty punctuation and orthography but also diluted Joseph's thick Yorkshire dialect. Writing to her publisher, W. S. Williams, she said thatIt seems to me advisable to modify the orthography of the old servant Joseph's speeches; for though, as it stands, it exactly renders the Yorkshire dialect to a Yorkshire ear, yet I am sure Southerns must find it unintelligible; and thus one of the most graphic characters in the book is lost on them.[13]Irene Wiltshire, in an essay on dialect and speech, examines some of the changes Charlotte made.[3]Critical response[edit]Contemporary reviews[edit]Early reviews ofWuthering Heightswere mixed. Most critics recognised the power and imagination of the novel, but were baffled by the storyline, and objected to the savagery and selfishness of the characters.[14]In 1847, when the background of an author was given great importance in literary criticism, many critics were intrigued by the authorship of the Bell novels.[15]TheAtlasreview called it a ""strange, inartistic story"", but commented that every chapter seems to contain a ""sort of rugged power.""[16]Graham's Lady Magazinewrote: ""How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery. It is a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors"".[17]The American Whig Reviewwrote:Respecting a book so original as this, and written with so much power of imagination, it is natural that there should be many opinions. Indeed, its power is so predominant that it is not easy after a hasty reading to analyze one's impressions so as to speak of its merits and demerits with confidence. We have been taken and carried through a new region, a melancholy waste, with here and there patches of beauty; have been brought in contact with fierce passions, with extremes of love and hate, and with sorrow that none but those who have suffered can understand.""[18]Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaperwrote:Wuthering Heightsis a strange sort of book,—baffling all regular criticism; yet, it is impossible to begin and not finish it; and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about. InWuthering Heightsthe reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love – even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself.[19]The Examinerwrote:This is a strange book. It is not without evidences of considerable power: but, as a whole, it is wild, confused, disjointed, and improbable; and the people who make up the drama, which is tragic enough in its consequences, are savages ruder than those who lived before the days ofHomer.[19]The Literary Worldwrote:In the whole story not a single trait of character is elicited which can command our admiration, not one of the fine feelings of our nature seems to have formed a part in the composition of its principal actors. In spite of the disgusting coarsness of much of the dialogue, and the improbabilities of much of the plot, we are spellbound.[20]The English poet and painterDante Gabriel Rossettiadmired the book, writing in 1854 that it was ""the first novel I've read for an age, and the best (as regards power and sound style) for two ages, exceptSidonia"",[21]but, in the same letter, he also referred to it as ""a fiend of a book – an incredible monster  ... The action is laid in hell, – only it seems places and people have English names there"".[22]Rossetti's friend, the poetAlgernon Charles Swinburnewas another early admirer of the novel, and in conclusion for an essay on Emily Brontë, published inThe Athenaeumin 1883, writes: ""As was the author's life, so is her book in all things: troubled and taintless, with little of rest in it, and nothing of reproach. It may be true that not many will ever take it to their hearts; it is certain that those who do like it will like nothing very much better in the whole world of poetry or prose.""[23]Twentieth century[edit]Until late in the 19th century ""Jane Eyrewas regarded as the best of the Brontë sisters' novels"". This view began to change in the 1880s with the publication ofA. Mary F. Robinson's biography of Emily in 1883.[24]Modernist novelistVirginia Woolfaffirmed the greatness ofWuthering Heightsin 1925:Wuthering Heightsis a more difficult book to understand thanJane Eyre, because Emily was a greater poet than Charlotte.... She looked out upon a world cleft into gigantic disorder and felt within her the power to unite it in a book. That gigantic ambition is to be felt throughout the novel... It is this suggestion of power underlying the apparitions of human nature and lifting them up into the presence of greatness that gives the book its huge stature among other novels.[25]Similarly, Woolf's contemporaryJohn Cowper Powysreferred in 1916 to Emily Brontë's ""tremendous vision"".[26]In 1926 Charles Percy Sanger's work on the chronology ofWuthering Heights""affirmed Emily's literary craft and meticulous planning of the novel and disproved Charlotte's presentation of her sister as an unconscious artist who 'did not know what she had done'."" However, for a later critic,Albert J. Guerard, ""it is a splendid, imperfect novel which Brontë loses control over occasionally"".[24]Still, in 1934,Lord David Cecil, writing inEarly Victorian Novelists, commented ""that Emily Brontë was not properly appreciated; even her admirers saw her as an 'unequal genius',""[24]and in 1948F. R. LeavisexcludedWuthering Heightsfromthe great traditionof the English novel because it was ""a 'kind of sport'—an anomaly with 'some influence of an essentially undetectable kind.'""[27]The novelistDaphne du Maurierargued the status ofWuthering Heightsas a ""supreme romantic novel"" in 1971:There is more savagery, more brutality, in the pages ofWuthering Heightsthan in any novel of the nineteenth century, and, for good measure, more beauty too, more poetry, and, what is more unusual, a complete lack of sexual emotion. ... Emily Brontë, striding over the Yorkshire moors with her dog, did not conjure from her imagination any cozy tale of happy lovers to console women readers sitting snugly within doors.[28]Twenty-first century[edit]Writing inThe Guardianin 2003 writer and editorRobert McCrumplacedWuthering Heightsin his list of 100 greatest novels of all time.[29]And in 2015 he placed it in his list of 100 best novels written in English.[30]He said thatWuthering Heightsreleases extraordinary new energies in the novel, renews its potential, and almost reinvents the genre. The scope and drift of its imagination, its passionate exploration of a fatal yet regenerative love affair, and its brilliant manipulation of time and space put it in a league of its own.[31]Writing for BBC Culture in 2015 author and book reviewer Jane Ciabattari[32]polled 82 book critics from outside the UK and presentedWuthering Heightsas number 7 in the resulting list of 100 greatest British novels.[33]In 2018Penguinpresented a list of 100 must-read classic books and placedWuthering Heightsat number 71, saying: ""Widely considered a staple of Gothic fiction and the English literary canon, this book has gone on to inspire many generations of writers – and will continue to do so"".[34]Writing inThe Independentjournalist and author Ceri Radford and news presenter, journalist, and TV producer Chris Harvey includedWuthering Heightsin a list of the 40 best books to read duringlockdown. Harvey said that ""It's impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers; Emily Brontë's vision of nature blazes with poetry"".[35]Setting[edit]Novelist John Cowper Powys notes the importance of the setting:By that singular and forlorn scenery—the scenery of the Yorkshire moors round her home—[Emily Brontë] was, however, in the more flexible portion of her curious nature inveterately influenced. She does not precisely describe this scenery—not at any length... but it sank so deeply into her that whatever she wrote was affected by it and bears its desolate and imaginative imprint.[36]Likewise Virginia Woolf suggests the importance of the Yorkshire landscape of Haworth to the poetic vision of both Emily and Charlotte Brontë:[Who] if they choose to write in prose, [were] intolerant of its restrictions. Hence it is that both Emily and Charlotte are always invoking the help of nature. They both feel the need of some more powerful symbol of the vast and slumbering passions in human nature than words or actions can convey. They seized those aspects of the earth which were most akin to what they themselves felt or imputed to their characters, and so their storms, their moors, their lovely spaces of summer weather are not ornaments applied to decorate a dull page or display the writer's powers of observation—they carry on the emotion and light up the meaning of the book.[37]Wuthering Heights is an old house high on thePenninemoorlandofWest Yorkshire. The first description is provided by Lockwood, the new tenant of the nearby Thrushcross Grange:Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling, ""wuthering"" being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed. One may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house, and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if cravingalmsof the sun.[38]Lord David CecilinEarly Victorian Novelists(1934) drew attention to the contrast between the two main settings inWuthering Heights:We have Wuthering Heights, the land of storm; high on the barren moorland, naked to the shock of the elements, the natural home of the Earnshaw family, fiery, untamed children of the storm. On the other hand, sheltered in the leafy valley below, stands Thrushcross Grange, the appropriate home of the children of calm, the gentle, passive, timid Lintons.[39]Walter Allen, inThe English Novel(1954), likewise ""spoke of the two houses in the novel as symbolising 'two opposed principles which... ultimately compose a harmony'"".[40]However,David Daiches, ""in the 1965 Penguin English Library edition referred to Cecil's interpretation as being 'persuasively argued' though not fully acceptable"". The entry onWuthering Heightsin the 2002Oxford Companion to English Literature, states that ""the ending of the novel points to a union of 'the two contrasting worlds and moral orders represented by the Heights and the Grange'"".[41]Inspiration for locations[edit]High Sunderland Hallin 1818, shortly before Emily Brontë saw the building.There is no evidence that either Thrushcross Grange or Wuthering Heights is based on an actual building, but various locations have been speculated as inspirations.Top Withens, a ruined farmhouse in an isolated area near theHaworth Parsonage, was suggested as the model for Wuthering Heights by Ellen Nussey, a friend ofCharlotte Brontë.[42]However, its structure does not match that of the farmhouse described in the novel.[43]High Sunderland Hall, near Law Hill,Halifaxwhere Emily worked briefly as a governess in 1838, now demolished,[43]has also been suggested as a model for Wuthering Heights. However, it is too grand for a farmhouse.[44]Ponden Hallis famous for reputedly being the inspiration for Thrushcross Grange, since Brontë was a frequent visitor. However, it does not match the description given in the novel and is closer in size and appearance to the farmhouse of Wuthering Heights. The Brontë biographer Winifred Gerin believed that Ponden Hall was the original of Wildfell Hall, the old mansion inAnne Brontë'sThe Tenant of Wildfell Hall.[45][46]Helen Smart, while noting that Thrushcross Grange has ""traditionally been associated with... Ponden Hall, Stanbury, near Haworth"", seesShibden Hall,Northowram, inHalifaxparish, as more likely,[47]referring to Hilda Marsden's article ""The Scenic Background of Wuthering Heights"".[48]Point of view[edit]Most of the novel is the story told by housekeeper Nelly Dean to Lockwood, though the novel uses several narrators (in fact, five or six) to place the story in perspective, or in a variety of perspectives.[49]Emily Brontë uses thisframe storytechnique to narrate most of the story. Thus, for example, Lockwood, the first narrator of the story, tells the story of Nelly, who herself tells the story of another character.[50]The use of a character like Nelly Dean is a literary device, a well-known convention taken from the Gothic novel, the function of which is to portray the events in a more mysterious and exciting manner.[51]Thus, the point of view comes from:... a combination of two speakers who outline the events of the plot within the framework of a story within a story. The frame story is that of Lockwood, who informs us of his meeting with the strange and mysterious ""family"" living in almost total isolation in the stony uncultivated land of northern England. The inner story is that of Nelly Dean, who transmits to Lockwood the history of the two families during the last two generations. Nelly Dean examines the events retrospectively and attempts to report them as an objective eyewitness to Lockwood.[52]Critics have questioned thereliability of the two main narrators.[52]The author has been described as sarcastic toward Lockwood, who fancies himself a world-weary romantic but comes across as an effete snob, and there are subtler hints that Nelly's perspective is influenced by her own biases.[53]The narrative in addition includes an excerpt from Catherine Earnshaw's old diary, and short sections narrated by Heathcliff, Isabella, and another servant.[53]Influences[edit]Brontë possessed an exceptional education of classical culture for a woman of the time. She was familiar withGreek tragediesand was a good Latinist.[54][55]In addition she was especially influenced by the poetsJohn MiltonandWilliam Shakespeare.[56]There are echoes of and allusions to Shakespeare's tragedies,King Lear,Romeo and Juliet,MacbethandHamletinWuthering Heights.[57][58][59]Another major source of information for theBrontëswas the periodicals that their father read, theLeeds IntelligencerandBlackwood's Edinburgh Magazine.[60]Blackwood's Magazineprovided knowledge of world affairs and was a source of material for the Brontës' early writing.[61]Emily Brontë was probably aware of the debate onevolution. This debate had been launched in 1844 byRobert Chambers. It raised questions of divine providence and the violence which underlies the universe and relationships between living things.[62]Romanticismwas also a major influence, which included theGothic novel, the novels ofWalter Scott[63]and the poetry ofByron. The Brontës' fiction is seen by some feminist critics as prime examples ofFemale Gothic. It explores the domestic entrapment and subjection of women topatriarchal authority, and the attempts to subvert and escape such restriction. Emily Brontë's Cathy Earnshaw and Charlotte Brontë'sJane Eyreare both examples of female protagonists in such a role.[64]According toJuliet Barker, Walter Scott's novelRob Roy(1817) had a significant influence onWuthering Heights, which, though ""regarded as the archetypal Yorkshire novel... owed as much, if not more, to Walter Scott's Border country"".Rob Royis set ""in the wilds ofNorthumberland, among the uncouth and quarrelsome squirearchical Osbaldistones"", while Cathy Earnshaw ""has strong similarities with Diana Vernon, who is equally out of place among her boorish relations"".[65]From 1833 Charlotte and Branwell'sAngrian talesbegan to featureByronic heroes. Such heroes had a strong sexual magnetism and passionate spirit, and demonstrated arrogance and black-heartedness. The Brontës had discovered Byron in an article inBlackwood's Magazinefrom August 1825. Byron had died the previous year. Byron became synonymous with the prohibited and audacious.[66]Romance tradition[edit]Emily Brontë wrote in theromance tradition of the novel.[67]Walter Scott defined this as ""a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents"".[68][69]Scott distinguished theromancefrom thenovel, where (as he saw it) ""events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society"".[70]Scott describes romance as a ""kindred term"" to novel. However, romances such asWuthering Heightsand Scott's ownhistorical romancesandHerman Melville'sMoby Dickare often referred to as novels.[71][72][73]Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: ""a novel isle roman,der Roman,il romanzo,en roman"".[74]This sort of romance is different from thegenre fictionlove romance orromance novel, with its ""emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending"".[75]Emily Brontë's approach to the novel form was influenced by the gothic novel.Gothic novel[edit]Heathcliff Under the Tree, wood engraving byFritz Eichenbergfrom a 1943 editionHorace Walpole'sThe Castle of Otranto(1764) is usually considered the first gothic novel. Walpole's declared aim was to combine elements of themedieval romance, which he deemed too fanciful, and the modern novel, which he considered to be too confined to strictrealism.[76]More recentlyEllen Moers, inLiterary Women, developed a feminist theory that connects female writers such as Emily Brontë withgothic fiction.[71]Catherine Earnshaw has been identified by some critics as a type of gothic demon because she ""shape-shifts"" in order to marry Edgar Linton, assuming a domesticity that is contrary to her true nature.[77]It has also been suggested that Catherine's relationship with Heathcliff conforms to the ""dynamics of the Gothic romance, in that the woman falls prey to the more or less demonic instincts of her lover, suffers from the violence of his feelings, and at the end is entangled by his thwarted passion"".[78]See also the discussion of the daemonic below, under ""Religion"".At one point in the novel Heathcliff is thought a vampire. It has been suggested that both he and Catherine are in fact meant to be seen as vampire-like personalities.[79][80]Themes[edit]Morality[edit]Some earlyVictorianreviewers complained about howWuthering Heightsdealt with violence and immorality. One called it ""a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors"".[17]Brontë was supposedly unaware of ""the limits on polite expression"" expected of Victorian novelists. Her characters use vulgar language, ""cursing and swearing"".[81]Though the daughter of a curate, Brontë shows little respect for religion in the novel; the only strongly religious character inWuthering Heightsis Joseph, who is usually seen as satirizing ""the joyless version ofMethodismthat the Brontë children were exposed to through their Aunt Branwell"".[82]A major influence on how Brontë depicts amoral characters was the stories her father Patrick Brontë told, about ""the doings"" of people around Haworth that his parishioners told him, ""stories which 'made one shiver and shrink from hearing' (Charlotte's friend Ellen Nussey reported)"", which were ""full of grim humour"" and violence, stories Emily Brontë took ""as a truth"".[83]Shortly after Emily Brontë's deathG.H. Leweswrote inLeader Magazine:Curious enough is to readWuthering HeightsandThe Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and remember that the writers were two retiring, solitary, consumptive girls! Books, coarse even for men, coarse in language and coarse in conception, the coarseness apparently of violence and uncultivated men – turn out to be the productions of two girls living almost alone, filling their loneliness with quiet studies, and writing their books from a sense of duty, hating the pictures they drew, yet drawing them with austere conscientiousness! There is matter here for the moralist or critic to speculate on.[84]Religion[edit]Emily Brontë attended church regularly and came from a religious family.[85]Emily ""never as far as we know, wrote anything which overtly criticised conventional religion. But she also has the reputation of being a rebel and iconoclast, driven by a spirit more pagan than orthodox Christian.""[86]Derek Traversi, for example, sees inWuthering Heights""a thirst for religious experience, 'which is not Christian'. It is this spirit which moves Catherine to exclaim, 'surely you and everybody have a notion that there is, or should be, an existence of yours beyond you. What were the use of my creation if I were entirely contained here?'"" (Ch. IX).[87][88]Thomas John Winnifrith, author ofThe Brontes and Their Background: Romance and Reality(Macmillan, 1977), argues that the allusions to Heaven and Hell are more than metaphors, and have a religious significance, because ""for Heathcliff, the loss of Catherine is literally Hell... 'existence after losing her would be Hell' (Ch. xiv, p. 117)."" Likewise, in the final scene between them, Heathcliff writhes ""in the torments of Hell (XV)"".[87]Daemonic[edit]The eminent German Lutheran theologian and philosopherRudolph Otto, author ofThe Idea of the Holy, saw inWuthering Heights""a supreme example of 'thedaemonic' in literature"".[89]Otto links the ""daemonic"" with ""a genuine religious experience"".[90]Lisa Wang argues that in bothWuthering Heights, and in her poetry, Emily Brontë concentrates on ""the non-conceptual"", or what Rudolf Otto[91]has called 'the non-rational' aspect of religion... the primal nature of religious experience over and above its doctrinal formulations"".[92]This corresponds with the dictionary meaning: ""of or relating to an inner or attendant spirit, esp. as a source of creative inspiration or genius"".[93]This meaning was important to theRomanticmovement.[94][95]However, the worddaemoncan also mean ""a demon or devil"", and that is equally relevant to Heathcliff,[96]whom Peter McInerney describes as ""a SatanicDon Juan"".[97]Heathcliff is also ""dark-skinned"",[98]""as dark almost as if it came from the devil"".[99]Likewise Charlotte Brontë described him ""'a man's shape animated by demon life – a Ghoul – an Afreet'"".[100]In Arabian mythology an ""afreet"", orifrit, is a powerful jinn or demon.[101]However, John Bowen believes that ""this is too simple a view"", because the novel presents an alternative explanation of Heathcliff's cruel and sadistic behaviour; that is, that he has suffered terribly: ""is an orphan;... is brutalised by Hindley;... relegated to the status of a servant; Catherine marries Edgar"".[102]Love[edit]One 2007 British poll presentedWuthering Heightsas the greatest love story of all time.[103]However, ""some of the novel's admirers consider it not a love story at all but an exploration of evil and abuse"".[53]Helen SmallseesWuthering Heightsas being both ""one of the greatest love stories in the English language"" and at the same time one of the ""most brutal revenge narratives"".[104]Some critics suggest that readingWuthering Heightsas a love story not only ""romanticizes abusive men and toxic relationships but goes against Brontë's clear intent"".[53]Moreover, while a ""passionate, doomed, death-transcending relationship between Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw Linton forms the core of the novel"",[53]Wuthering Heights:... consistently subverts the romantic narrative. Our first encounter with Heathcliff shows him to be a nasty bully. Later, Brontë puts in Heathcliff's mouth an explicit warning not to turn him into a Byronic hero: After... Isabella elop[es] with him, he sneers that she did so ""under a delusion... picturing in me a hero of romance"".[53]""I am Heathcliff"" is a frequently quoted phrase from the novel, and ""the idea of... perfect unity between the self and the other is age-old"", so that Catherine says that she loves Heathcliff ""because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same"" (Chapter IX).[105]Likewise Lord David Cecil suggests that ""the deepest attachments are based on characters' similarity or affinity"",[106]HoweverSimone de Beauvoir, in her famous feminist workThe Second Sex(1949), suggests that when Catherine says ""I am Heathcliff"": ""her own world collapse(s) in contingence, for she really lives in his.""[107]Beauvoir sees this as ""the fatal mirage of the ideal of romantic love... transcendence... in the superior male who is perceived as free"".[108]Despite all the passion between Catherine and Heathcliff, critics have from early on drawn attention to the absence of sex. In 1850 the poet and criticSydney Dobellsuggests that ""we dare not doubt [Catherine's] purity"",[109]and the Victorian poetSwinburneconcurs, referring to their ""passionate and ardent chastity"".[110][111]More recentlyTerry Eagletonsuggests their relationship is sexless, ""because the two, unknown to themselves, are half-siblings, with an unconscious fear of incest"".[112]Childhood[edit]Childhood is a central theme ofWuthering Heights.[113]Emily Brontë ""understands that 'The Child is 'Father of the Man' (Wordsworth, 'My heart leaps up', 1. 7)"".Wordsworth, followingphilosophers of education, such asRousseau, explored ideas about the way childhood shaped personality. One outcome of this was the Germanbildungsroman, or ""novel of education"", such as Charlotte Brontë'sJane Eyre(1847), Eliot'sThe Mill on the Floss(1860), and Dickens'sGreat Expectations(1861).[114]Bronte's characters ""are heavily influenced by their childhood experiences"", though she is less optimistic than her contemporaries that suffering can lead to ""change and renewal"".[115]Class and money[edit]Lockwood arrives at Thrushcross Grange in 1801, a time when, according to Q.D. Leavis, ""the old rough farming culture, based on a naturally patriarchal family life, was to be challenged, tamed and routed by social and cultural changes"". At this date theIndustrial Revolutionwas well under way, and was by 1847 a dominant force in much of England, and especially inWest Yorkshire. This caused a disruption in ""the traditional relationship of social classes"" with an expanding upwardly mobile middle-class, which created ""a new standard for defining a gentleman"", and challenged the traditional criteria of breeding and family and the more recent criterion of character.[116]Marxist criticArnold KettleseesWuthering Heights""as a symbolic representation of the class system of 19th-century England"", with its concerns ""with property-ownership, the attraction of social comforts"", marriage, education, religion, and social status.[117]Driven by a pathological hatred Heathcliff uses against his enemies ""their own weapons of money and arranged marriages"", as well as ""the classic methods of the ruling class, expropriation and property deals"".[118]Later, another Marxist,Terry Eagleton, inMyths of Power: A Marxist Study of the Brontës(London: McMillan, 1975), further explores the power relationships between ""the landed gentry and aristocracy, the traditional power-holders, and the capitalist, industrial middle classes"". Haworth in theWest Ridingof Yorkshire was especially affected by changes to society and its class structure ""because of the concentration of large estates and industrial centers"" there.[116]Race[edit]There has been debate about Heathcliff's race or ethnicity. In the novel Heathcliff is first described as a ""dark-skinned gipsy"" in appearance with ""black eyes"", as well as later being said to be ""as white as the wall behind him""[119]: 21and ""pale...with an
expression of mortal hate."".[119]: 243Mr Linton, the Earnshaws' neighbour, suggests that he might be ""a littleLascar(a 19th-century term for Indian sailors;[98]), or an American or Spanish castaway"".[119]: 44Mr Earnshaw calls him ""as dark almost as if it came from the devil"",[99]and Nelly Dean speculates fancifully regarding his origins thus: ""Who knows but your father was Emperor of China, and your mother an Indian queen?""[120]NovelistCaryl Phillipssuggests that Heathcliff may have been an escaped slave, noting the similarities between the way Heathcliff is treated and the way slaves were treated at the time: he is referred to as ""it"", his name ""served him"" as both his ""Christian and surname"",[99]and Mr Earnshaw is referred to as ""his owner"".[121]Maja-Lisa von Sneidern states that ""Heathcliff's racial otherness cannot be a matter of dispute; Brontë makes that explicit"", further noting that ""by 1804 Liverpool merchants were responsible for more than eighty-four percent of the British transatlantic slave trade.""[122]Michael Stewart sees Heathcliff's race as ""ambiguous"" and argues that Emily Brontë ""deliberately gives us this missing hole in the narrative"".[123]Storm and calm[edit]Various critics have explored the various contrast between Thrushcross Grange and the Wuthering Heights farmhouse and their inhabitants. Lord David Cecil argued for ""cosmic forces as the central impetus and controlling force in the novel"" and suggested that there is a unifying structure underlyingWuthering Heights: ""two spiritual principles: the principle of the storm,... and the principle of calm"", which he further argued were not, ""in spite of their apparent opposition"", in conflict.[124]Dorothy van Ghent, however, refers to ""a tension between two kinds of reality"" in the novel: ""civilized manners"" and ""natural energies"".[125]Adaptations[edit]Main article:Adaptations ofWuthering HeightsFilm and TV[edit]Poster for1920 adaptationofWuthering Heights, billed as ""Emily Brontë's tremendous Story of Hate""Laurence OlivierandMerle Oberonin the 1939 filmWuthering HeightsThe earliest known film adaptation ofWuthering Heightswas filmed in England in 1920 and was directed byA. V. Bramble. It is unknown if any prints still exist.[126]The most famous is 1939'sWuthering Heights, starringLaurence OlivierandMerle Oberonand directed byWilliam Wyler. This acclaimed adaptation, like many others, eliminated the second generation's story (young Cathy, Linton and Hareton) and is rather inaccurate as a literary adaptation. It won the 1939New York Film Critics Circle Awardfor Best Film and was nominated for the 1939Academy Award for Best Picture.Nigel Kneale's script was produced forBBCTelevision twice, firstly in 1953, starringRichard ToddasHeathcliffandYvonne MitchellasCathy. Broadcast live, no recordings of the production are known to exist. The second adaptation using Kneale's script was in 1962, starringClaire Bloomas Catherine andKeith Michellas Heathcliff. This production does exist with theBFI, but has been withheld from public viewing.[127]Kneale's script was also adapted for Australian television in 1959 during a time when original drama productions in the country were rare. Broadcast live from Sydney, the performance wastelerecorded, although it is unknown if this kinescope still exists.In 1958, an adaptation aired onCBStelevision as part of the seriesDuPont Show of the MonthstarringRosemary Harrisas Cathy andRichard Burtonas Heathcliff.[128]The BBC produced afour-part television dramatisationin 1967 starringIan McShaneandAngela Scoular.[129]Les Hauts de Hurleventis a French mini-series in six 26-minute episodes, in black and white, created and directed by Jean-Paul Carrère based on the novel, and broadcast between 1964 and 1968 on the first ORTF channel.The1970 filmwithTimothy Daltonas Heathcliff is the first colour version of the novel. It has gained acceptance over the years although it was initially poorly received. The character of Hindley is portrayed much more sympathetically, and his story-arc is altered. It also subtly suggests that Heathcliff may be Cathy's illegitimate half-brother.In 1978, the BBC produced afive-part TV serialisationof the book starring Ken Hutchinson, Kay Adshead and John Duttine, with music by Carl Davis; it is considered one of the most faithful adaptations of Emily Brontë's story.[130]There is also a 1985 French film adaptation,HurleventbyJacques Rivette, and a 1988Japanese film adaptationbyYoshishige Yoshida.[131]The 1992 filmEmily Brontë's Wuthering HeightsstarringRalph FiennesandJuliette Binocheis notable for including the oft-omitted second generation story of the children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff.More recent film or TV adaptations includeITV's 2009two-part drama seriesstarringTom Hardy,Charlotte Riley,Sarah Lancashire, andAndrew Lincoln,[132]and the2011 filmstarringKaya Scodelarioand James Howson and directed byAndrea Arnold.Adaptations which place the story in a new setting include the1954 adaptation, retitledAbismos de pasión,directed by Spanish filmmakerLuis Buñueland set in Catholic Mexico, with Heathcliff and Cathy renamed Alejandro and Catalina. In Buñuel's version Heathcliff/Alejandro claims to have become rich by making a deal with Satan. TheNew York Timesreviewed a re-release of this film as ""an almost magical example of how an artist of genius can take someone else's classic work and shape it to fit his own temperament without really violating it,"" noting that the film was thoroughly Spanish and Catholic in its tone while still highly faithful to Brontë.[133]Yoshishige Yoshida's1988 adaptationalso has a transposed setting, this time to medieval Japan. In Yoshida's version, the Heathcliff character, Onimaru, is raised in a nearby community of priests who worship a local fire god. Filipino director Carlos Siguion-Reyna made a film adaptation titledHihintayin Kita sa Langit(1991). The screenplay was written by Raquel Villavicencio and produced byArmida Siguion-Reyna. It starredRichard Gomezas Gabriel (Heathcliff) andDawn Zuluetaas Carmina (Catherine). It became a Filipino film classic.[134]In 2003, MTV produced a poorly reviewedversionset in a modern California high school.Wuthering High, a 2015TV Movieshown onLifetime, is set inMalibu, California.The 1966HindifilmDil Diya Dard Liyais based upon this novel. The film is directed byAbdul Rashid KardarandDilip Kumar. The film stars Dilip Kumar,Waheeda Rehman,Pran,Rehman,ShyamaandJohnny Walker. The music is byNaushad. Although it did not fare as well as other movies of Dilip Kumar, it was well received by critics.The 2000HindifilmDhadkanis also based upon this novel. Directed byDharmesh Darshanand produced byRatan Jain,[135]it starsAkshay Kumar,Shilpa Shetty,Sunil ShettyandMahima Chaudhry.In 2022,Emma Mackeystarred in a biopic of Emily Brontë inEmily. The film charts the life of Brontë and the inspiration she gained for writing Wuthering Heights living in the Yorkshire countryside.In July 2024, it was announced thatEmerald Fennellwas set to direct and writea new film adaptation of the novelforWarner Bros.. StarringMargot Robbieas Catherine Earnshaw, andJacob Elordias Heathcliffe, it is set to be released in theatres on 13 February 2026.[136]Theatre[edit]The novel has been adapted as operas composed byBernard Herrmann,Carlisle Floyd, andFrédéric Chaslin(most cover only the first half of the book) and a musical byBernard J. Taylor.In 2021,Emma Ricedirected a theatrical version which was shown online and at theBristol Old Vic.[137]This production was then put on at the National Theatre in 2022.[138]Works inspired byWuthering Heights[edit]Main article:List of Wuthering Heights referencesLiterature[edit]Mizumura Minae'sA True Novel(Honkaku shosetsu) (2002) is inspired byWuthering Heightsand might be called an adaptation of the story in a post-World War II Japanese setting.[139]InJane Urquhart'sChanging Heaven, the novelWuthering Heights, as well as the ghost of Emily Brontë, feature as prominent roles in the narrative.In her 2019 novel,The West Indian, Valerie Browne Lester imagines an origin story for Heathcliff in 1760s Jamaica.[140]K-Ming Chang's 2021 chapbookBone Housewas released by Bull City Press as part of theirInchseries.[141]The collection functions as a queer Taiwanese-American retelling ofWuthering Heights, in which an unnamed narrator moves into a butcher's mansion ""with a life of its own.""[142]Canadian authorHilary Scharper's ecogothic novelPerdita(2013) was deeply influenced byWuthering Heights,namely in terms of the narrative role of powerful, cruel and desolate landscapes.[143]The poem ""Wuthering"" (2017) byTanya GraeusesWuthering Heightsas an allegory.[144]Maryse Condé'sWindward Heights(La migration des coeurs) (1995) is a reworking ofWuthering Heightsset inCubaandGuadeloupeat the turn of the 20th century,[145]which Condé stated she intended as an homage to Brontë.[146]In 2011, agraphic novelversion was published by Classical Comics.[147]It was adapted by Scottish writerSean Michael Wilsonand hand painted by comic book veteran artistJohn M. Burns. This version, which stays close to the original novel, was shortlisted for the Stan Lee Excelsior Awards.[148]Music[edit]Kate Bush's 1978 song ""Wuthering Heights"" is most likely the best-known creative work inspired by Brontë's story that is not properly an ""adaptation"". Bush wrote the song when she was 18 and chose it as the lead single from her debut album. It was primarily inspired by her viewing of the 1967 BBC adaptation. The song is sung from Catherine's point of view as she pleads at Heathcliff's window to be admitted. It uses quotations from Catherine, both in the chorus (""Let me in! I'm so cold!"") and the verses, with Catherine admitting she had ""bad dreams in the night"". Critic Sheila Whiteley wrote that the ethereal quality of the vocal resonates with Cathy's dementia, and that Bush's high register has both ""childlike qualities in its purity of tone"" and an ""underlying eroticism in its sinuous erotic contours"".[149]SingerPat Benatarcovered the song in 1980 on herCrimes of Passionalbum. Brazilian heavy metal bandAngrareleased a version of Bush's song on its debut albumAngels Cryin 1993.[150]A 2018 cover of Bush's ""Wuthering Heights"" byJimmy Urineadds electropunk elements.[151]Wind & Wuthering(1976) by English rock bandGenesisalludes to the Brontë novel not only in the album's title but also in the titles of two of its tracks, ""Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers..."" and ""...In That Quiet Earth"". Both titles refer to the closing lines of the novel.SongwriterJim Steinmansaid that he wrote the 1989 song ""It's All Coming Back to Me Now"" ""while under the influence ofWuthering Heights"". He said that the song was ""about being enslaved and obsessed by love"" and compared it to ""Heathcliff digging up Cathy's corpse and dancing with it in the cold moonlight"".[152]The 2008 song ""Cath..."" byindie rockbandDeath Cab for Cutiewas inspired byWuthering Heights.[citation needed]Wuthering Heightsis also the name of a Danish-Swedishpower metalband.[citation needed]In 2024 an indie band ""Mili"" released a single ""Through Patches of Violet"". The song features some themes that Wuthering Heights carries, mainly – poorly communicated love. Two voices, sung byCassie Wei, are Heathcliff and Catherine. Originally made for a game ""Limbus Company"", which features Wuthering Heights's other characters and story elements.[153]References[edit]^""New Novels, Published by Mr. Newby, in 3 vols, this day, Wuthering Heights and Agnes Grey, by Acton and Ellis Bell, Esqrs"".The Morning Post. 24 November 1847. p. 1 – via British Newspaper Archive.^Lindseth, John (2011).""'A Note on the Search for the Publication Date of Wuthering Heights , Boston, Coolidge & Wiley, 1848"".ResearchGate.

Tolkien. It was published in 1937 to wide critical acclaim, being nominated for theCarnegie Medaland awarded a prize from theNew York Herald Tribunefor best juvenile fiction. It is recognized as a classic in children's literature and is one of thebest-selling books of all time, with over 100 million copies sold.The Hobbitis set inMiddle-earthand follows home-lovingBilbo Baggins, the titularhobbitwho joins the wizardGandalfand the thirteendwarvesofThorin's Companyon aquestto reclaim the dwarves' home and treasure from the dragonSmaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from his peaceful rural surroundings into more sinister territory.The story is told in the form of apicaresque or episodic quest;[1]several chapters introduce a new type of monster or threat as Bilbo progresses through the landscape. Bilbogains a new level of maturity, competence, and wisdomby accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey and adventurous sides of his nature and applying his wits and common sense. The story reaches its climax in the Battle of Five Armies, where many of the characters and creatures from earlier chapters re-emerge to engage in conflict. Personal growth and forms of heroism are central themes of the story, along with motifs of warfare. These themes have led critics to viewTolkien's own experiences duringtheFirst World Waras instrumental in shaping the story. His scholarly knowledge ofGermanic philologyand interest in mythology andfairy talesare often noted as influences, but more recent fiction includingadventure storiesand the works ofWilliam Morrisalsoplayed a part.The publisher was encouraged by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on itssuccessor,The Lord of the Rings, he made retrospective accommodations for it inThe Hobbit. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo stumbled. The work has never been out of print. Its ongoing legacy encompasses many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition on their own merits.Narrative[edit]Characters[edit]Main article:List ofThe HobbitcharactersBilbo Baggins, the protagonist, is a respectable, reserved and well-to-dohobbit—a race resembling short humans with furry, leathery feet who live in underground houses and are mainly farmers and gardeners.[2][3][4]Gandalf, an itinerantwizard,[5]introduces Bilbo to a company ofthirteen dwarves.Thorin Oakenshieldis the proud, pompous[6][7]head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under theLonely Mountain.Smaugis adragonwho long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.The plot involves a host of other characters of varying importance, such as thetwelve other dwarves of the company; two types ofelves: bothpuckishand more seriouswarrior types;[8]Men; man-eatingtrolls; boulder-throwing giants; evil cave-dwellinggoblins; forest-dwelling giant spiders who can speak; immense and heroiceagleswho also speak; evil wolves, orWargs, who are allied with the goblins;Elrondthe sage;Gollum, a strange creature inhabiting an underground lake;Beorn, a man who can assume bear form; andBard the Bowman, a grim but honourable archer ofLake-town.[7][9]Plot[edit]GandalftricksBilbo Bagginsinto hosting a party forThorin Oakenshieldand his band of twelvedwarves(Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur), who go over their plans to reclaim their ancient home,Lonely Mountain, and its vast treasure from the dragonSmaug. Gandalf unveils Thror's map showing asecret doorinto the Mountain and proposes that dumbfounded Bilbo should serve as the expedition's ""burglar"". The dwarves ridicule the idea, but Bilbo, indignant, sets off with them.The group travels into the wild. Gandalf saves the company fromtrollsand leads them toRivendell, whereElrondreveals more secrets from the map. When they attempt to cross theMisty Mountains, they are caught bygoblinsand drivendeep underground. Although Gandalf kills the goblin king and rescues them, Bilbo gets separated from the others as they flee the goblins. Lost in the goblin tunnels, he stumbles acrossa mysterious ringand then encountersGollum, who engages him in a game, each posing a riddle until one of them cannot solve it. If Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out of the tunnels, but if he fails, his life will be forfeit. With the help of the ring, which confersinvisibilitywhen worn, Bilbo escapes and rejoins the dwarves, improving his reputation with them. The goblins and Wargs give chase, but the company are saved by eagles. They rest in the house of the skin-changer Beorn.Sketch map ofMirkwood,Erebor(the Lonely Mountain), andEsgaroth(Lake-Town)The company enters the dark forest ofMirkwoodwithout Gandalf, who has other responsibilities. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders and then from the dungeons of the Wood-elves. Nearing theLonely Mountain, the travellers are welcomed by the human inhabitants ofLake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition reaches the mountain and finds the secret door. The dwarves send a reluctant Bilbo inside to scout the dragon's lair. He steals a great cup and, while conversing with Smaug, spots a gap in the ancient dragon's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided the intruders, flies off to destroy the town. Athrushoverhears Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability and tells a Lake-town resident named Bard. Smaug wreaks havoc on the town, until Bard shoots an arrow into thechink in Smaug's armour, killing the dragon.When the dwarves take possession of the mountain, Bilbo finds the Arkenstone, the most-treasured heirloom of Thorin's family, and hides it away. The Wood-elves and Lake-men request compensation for Lake-town's destruction and settlement of old claims on the treasure. When Thorin refuses to give them anything, they besiege the mountain. However, Thorin manages to send a message to his kinfolk in theIron Hillsand reinforces his position. Bilbo slips out and gives the Arkenstone to the besiegers, hoping to head off a war. When they offer the jewel to Thorin in exchange for treasure, Bilbo reveals how they obtained it. Thorin, furious at what he sees as betrayal, banishes Bilbo, and battle seems inevitable whenDain, Thorin's second cousin, arrives with an army of dwarf warriors.Gandalf reappears to warn all of an approaching army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn, who fights in his bear form and kills the goblin general, do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies.Bilbo accepts only a small portion of his share of the treasure, having no want or need for more, but still returnshomea very wealthy hobbit roughly a year and a month after he first left. Years later, hewrites the story of his adventures.Concept and creation[edit]Background[edit]Further information:Hobbit(word)In the early 1930s Tolkien was pursuing an academic career at theUniversity of OxfordasRawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship atPembroke College. Several of his poems had been published in magazines and small collections, includingGoblin Feet[10]andThe Cat and the Fiddle: A Nursery Rhyme Undone and its Scandalous Secret Unlocked,[11]a reworking ofHey Diddle Diddle, an Englishnursery rhyme. His creative endeavours at this time also includedletters from Father Christmasto his children—illustrated manuscripts that featured warringgnomesandgoblins, and a helpfulpolar bear—alongside the creation ofelven languagesand an attendant mythology, includingThe Book of Lost Tales, which he had been creating since 1917. These works were all published posthumously.[12]In a 1955 letter toW. H. Auden, Tolkien recollects that he beganThe Hobbitone day early in the 1930s. While he was markingSchool Certificatepapers, he found a blank page. Suddenly inspired, he wrote the words, ""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit."" By late 1932 he had finished the story and then lent the manuscript to several friends, includingC. S. Lewis[13]and a student of Tolkien's named Elaine Griffiths.[14]In 1936, when Griffiths was visited in Oxford by Susan Dagnall, a staff member of the publisherGeorge Allen & Unwin, she is reported to have either lent Dagnall the book[14]or suggested that she should borrow it from Tolkien.[15]In any event, Dagnall was impressed by it, and showed the book toStanley Unwin, who then asked his 10-year-old sonRaynerto review it. Rayner's favourable comments settled Allen & Unwin's decision to publish Tolkien's book.[16]Setting[edit]The setting ofThe Hobbit, as described on its original dust jacket, is""ancient time between the age of Faerie and the dominion of men""in an unnamedfantasy world.[17]The world is shown on the endpaper map as ""Western Lands"" westward and ""Wilderland"" as the east. Originally this world was self-contained, but as Tolkien began work onThe Lord of the Rings, he decided these stories could fit into thelegendariumhe had been working on privately for decades.The HobbitandThe Lord of the Ringsbecame the end of the ""Third Age"" ofMiddle EarthwithinArda. Eventually those tales of the earlier periods became published asThe Silmarillionand other posthumous works.Illustration and design[edit]Further information:J. R. R. Tolkien's artworkAnglo-Saxon runesand their English letter values,[18]used in Tolkien'sThe HobbitillustrationsTolkien's correspondence and publisher's records show that he was involved in the design and illustration of the entire book. All elements were the subject of considerable correspondence and fussing over by Tolkien. Rayner Unwin, in his publishing memoir, comments: ""In 1937 alone Tolkien wrote 26 letters to George Allen & Unwin... detailed, fluent, often pungent, but infinitely polite and exasperatingly precise... I doubt any author today, however famous, would get such scrupulous attention.""[19]Even the maps, of which Tolkien originally proposed five, were considered and debated. He wishedThror's Mapto be tipped in (that is, glued in after the book has been bound) at first mention in the text, and with themoon letterruneson the reverse so they could be seen when held up to the light.[20]In the end the cost, as well as the shading of the maps, which would be difficult to reproduce, resulted in the final design of two maps as endpapers,Thror's map, and theMap of Wilderland(seeRhovanion), both printed in black and red on the paper's cream background.[21]Originally Allen & Unwin planned to illustrate the book only with the endpaper maps, but Tolkien's first tendered sketches so charmed the publisher's staff that they opted to include them without raising the book's price despite the extra cost. Thus encouraged, Tolkien supplied a second batch of illustrations. The publisher accepted all of these as well, giving the first edition ten black-and-white illustrations plus the two endpaper maps. The illustrated scenes were:The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water,TheTrolls,The Mountain Path,TheMisty Mountainslooking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate,Beorn's Hall,Mirkwood,The Elvenking's Gate,Lake Town,TheFront GateandThe Hall atBag-End. All but one of the illustrations were a full page, and one, the Mirkwood illustration, required a separate plate.[22]Satisfied with his skills, the publishers asked Tolkien to design a dust jacket. This project, too, became the subject of many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription around the edges of the illustration are a phonetictransliterationof English, giving the title of the book and details of the author and publisher.[23]The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.[24]The publisher's production staff designed a binding, but Tolkien objected to several elements. Through several iterations, the final design ended up as mostly the author's. The spine shows runes: two ""þ"" (Thrainand Thror) runes and one ""d"" (door). The front and back covers were mirror images of each other, with an elongated dragon characteristic of Tolkien's style stamped along the lower edge, and with a sketch of the Misty Mountains stamped along the upper edge.[25]Swedish and Finnish book covers ofThe Hobbitillustrated byTove JanssonOnce illustrations were approved for the book, Tolkien proposed colour plates as well. The publisher would not relent on this, so Tolkien pinned his hopes on the American edition to be published about six months later. Houghton Mifflin rewarded these hopes with the replacement of the frontispiece (The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water) in colour and the addition of new colour plates:Rivendell,Bilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes,Bilbo comes to the Huts of the Raft-elvesandConversation withSmaug, which features adwarvishcurse written in Tolkien's invented scriptTengwar, and signed with two ""þ"" (""Th"") runes.[26]The additional illustrations proved so appealing that George Allen & Unwin adopted the colour plates as well for their second printing, with exception ofBilbo Woke Up with the Early Sun in His Eyes.[27]Different editions have been illustrated in diverse ways. Many follow the original scheme at least loosely, but many others are illustrated by other artists, especially the many translated editions. Some cheaper editions, particularly paperback, are not illustrated except with the maps. ""The Children's Book Club"" edition of 1942 includes the black-and-white pictures but no maps, an anomaly.[28]Douglas Anderson'sThe Annotated Hobbitis illustrated with many black-and-white drawings taken from translations of the story into some 25 languages.[29][30]Tolkien's use of runes, both as decorative devices and as magical signs within the story, has been cited as a major cause for the popularization of runes within ""New Age"" andesotericliterature,[31]stemming from Tolkien's popularity with the elements ofcounter-culturein the 1970s.[32]Genre[edit]The Hobbittakes cues from narrative models ofchildren's literature, as shown by itsomniscient narratorand characters that young children can relate to, such as the small, food-obsessed, andmorally ambiguousBilbo. The text emphasizes the relationship between time and narrative progress and it openly distinguishes ""safe"" from ""dangerous"" in its geography. Both are key elements of works intended for children,[33]as is the ""home-away-home"" (orthere and back again) plot structure typical of theBildungsroman.[34]While Tolkien later claimed to dislike the aspect of the narrative voice addressing the reader directly,[35]the narrative voice contributes significantly to the success of the novel.[36]The scholar Lois R. Kuznets comments that the ""obtrusive narrator"" is part of a standard ""rhetoric of childhood""; C. W. Sullivan III adds that Tolkien may have taken the idea of an intrusive narrator from the medieval textsBeowulfandSir Gawain and the Green Knight.[37]Emer O'Sullivan, in herComparative Children's Literature, notesThe Hobbitas one of a handful of children's books that have been accepted into mainstream literature, alongsideJostein Gaarder'sSophie's World(1991) andJ. K. Rowling'sHarry Potterseries (1997–2007).[38]Tolkien intendedThe Hobbitas a ""fairy-story"" and wrote it in a tone suited to addressing children;[39]he said later that the book was not specifically written for children, but had rather been created out of his interest in mythology and legend.[40]Many of the initial reviews refer to the work as a fairy story. However, according toJack Zipeswriting inThe Oxford Companion to Fairy Tales, Bilbo is an atypical character for a fairy tale.[41]The work is much longer than Tolkien's ideal proposed in his essayOn Fairy-Stories. Many fairy tale motifs, such as the repetition of similar events seen in the dwarves' arrival at Bilbo's and Beorn's homes, and folklore themes, such astrollsturning to stone, are to be found in the story.[42]The book is popularly called (and often marketed as) afantasy novel, but likePeter Pan and WendybyJ. M. BarrieandThe Princess and the GoblinbyGeorge MacDonald, both of which influenced Tolkien and contain fantasy elements, it is primarily identified as being children's literature.[43][44]The two genres are not mutually exclusive, so some definitions ofhigh fantasyinclude works for children by authors such asL. Frank BaumandLloyd Alexanderalongside the works ofGene WolfeandJonathan Swift, which are more often considered adult literature.The Hobbithas been called ""the most popular of all twentieth-century fantasies written for children"".[45]Jane Chance, however, considers the book to be a children's novel only in the sense that it appeals to the child in an adult reader.[46]Sullivan credits the first publication ofThe Hobbitas an important step in the development of high fantasy, and further credits the 1960s paperback debuts ofThe HobbitandThe Lord of the Ringsas essential to the creation of a mass market for fiction of this kind as well as the fantasy genre's current status.[47]Style[edit]Further information:Tolkien's prose styleandQuests in Middle-earthTolkien's proseis unpretentious and straightforward, taking as given the existence of his imaginary world and describing its details in a matter-of-fact way, while often introducing the new and fantastic in an almost casual manner. This down-to-earth style, also found in later fantasy such asRichard Adams'Watership DownandPeter Beagle'sThe Last Unicorn, accepts readers into thefictional world, rather than cajoling or attempting to convince them of its reality.[48]WhileThe Hobbitis written in a simple, friendly language, each of its characters has a unique voice. The narrator, who occasionally interrupts the narrative flow with asides (a device common to both children's and Anglo-Saxon literature),[47]has his own linguistic style separate from those of the main characters.[49]The basic form of the story is that of aquest,[50]told in episodes. For the most part of the book, each chapter introduces a different denizen of the Wilderland, some helpful and friendly towards the protagonists, and others threatening or dangerous. However the general tone is kept light-hearted, being interspersed with songs and humour. One example of the use of song to maintain tone is when Thorin and Company are kidnapped by goblins, who, when marching them into the underworld, sing:Clap! Snap! the black crack!Grip, grab! Pinch, nab!And down down toGoblin-townYou go, my lad!Thisonomatopoeicsinging undercuts the dangerous scene with a sense of humour. Tolkien achieves balance of humour and danger through other means as well, as seen in the foolishness andCockney dialectof the trolls and in the drunkenness of the elven captors.[51]The general form—that of a journey into strange lands, told in a light-hearted mood and interspersed with songs—may be following the model ofThe Icelandic JournalsbyWilliam Morris, an important literaryinfluence on Tolkien.[52]Influences[edit]Further information:Influences on J. R. R. TolkienNorse mythology[edit]Further information:Tolkien and the NorseTolkien's works show manyinfluences from Norse mythology, reflecting his lifelong passion for those stories and his academicinterest in Germanic philology.[53]The Hobbitis no exception to this; the work shows influences from northern European literature, myths and languages,[47]especially from thePoetic Eddaand theProse Edda. Examples include the names of the dwarves,[54]Fili, Kili, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, Dori, Nori, Dwalin,Balin, Dain, Nain and Thorin Oakenshield, along with Gandalf which was a dwarf-name in the Norse.[a][56]But while their names are Norse, the characters of the dwarves are based on fairy tales such asSnow WhiteandSnow-White and Rose-Redas collected by theBrothers Grimm, while the latter tale may have influenced the character of Beorn.[57]Tolkien's use of descriptive names such asMisty MountainsandBag Endechoes the names used in Old Norsesagas.[58]The names of the dwarf-friendly ravens, such as Roäc, are derived from the Old Norse words for ""raven"" and ""rook"",[59]but their peaceful characters are unlike the typical carrion birds from Old Norse and Old English literature.[60]Tolkien is not simply skimming historical sources for effect: the juxtaposition of old and new styles of expression is seen by the Tolkien scholarTom Shippeyas one of the major themes explored inThe Hobbit.[61]Mapsfigure in both saga literature andThe Hobbit.[58]Old English literature[edit]Further information:Beowulf and Middle-earthThemes fromOld English literature, especially fromBeowulf, shape the ancient world which Bilbo stepped into. Tolkien, a scholar ofBeowulf, counted the epic among his ""most valued sources"" forThe Hobbit.[62]Tolkien was one of the first critics to treatBeowulfas a literary work with value beyond the merely historical, with his 1936 lectureBeowulf: the Monsters and the Critics. Tolkien borrowed several elements fromBeowulf, including a monstrous, intelligent dragon.[63]Certain descriptions inThe Hobbitseem to have been lifted straight out ofBeowulfwith some minor rewording, such as when the dragon stretches its neck out to sniff for intruders.[64]Likewise, Tolkien's descriptions of the lair as accessed through a secret passage mirror those inBeowulf. Other specific plot elements and features inThe Hobbitthat show similarities toBeowulfinclude the title ofthief, as Bilbo is called by Gollum and later by Smaug, and Smaug's personality, which leads to the destruction of Lake-town.[65]Tolkien refines parts ofBeowulf'splot that he appears to have found less than satisfactorily described, such as details about the cup-thief and the dragon's intellect and personality.[66]Named swordsof renown, adorned with runes, similarly have Old English connections. In using his elf-sword, Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the sword ""Sting"" we see Bilbo's acceptance of the kinds of cultural and linguistic practices found inBeowulf, signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself.[67]This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragon's hoard, rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroringBeowulfand an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns. As Tolkien wrote, ""The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this point. I fancy the author ofBeowulfwould say much the same.""[62]The name of the wizardRadagastis taken from the name of theSlavic deityRadogost.[68]Medieval and mythological sources[edit]Further information:Tolkien and the medievalBilbo's role as burglar places him in thetrickstertradition of figures likePrometheuswho stole fire from the gods.[1]Painting byJan Cossiers, 1637The representation of the dwarves inThe Hobbitwas influenced by his own selective reading of medieval texts regarding theJewish peopleandtheir history.[69]The dwarves' characteristics of being dispossessed of their ancient homeland at the Lonely Mountain, and living among other groups whilst retaining their own culture are all derived from the medieval image of Jews,[69][70]whilst their warlike nature stems from accounts in theHebrew Bible.[69]The Dwarvish calendar invented forThe Hobbitreflects theJewish calendarwhich begins in late autumn.[69]And although Tolkien denied that he usedallegory, the dwarves taking Bilbo out of his complacent existence has been seen as an eloquent metaphor for the ""impoverishment of Western society without Jews.""[70]The scholar of literature James L. Hodge describes the story aspicaresque, a genre of fiction in which a hero relies on his wits to survive a series of risky episodes. Hodge further likens Bilbo's admittedly unheroic business of burglary to thetricksterrole of some pagan gods and mythical figures:Hermessteals cattle fromApollo,PrometheusandCoyotesteal fire,Odinsteals themead of poetry, and so on. Hodge quotes the psychiatristCarl Jungas saying that the figure of the trickster occurs in every age, whether in sacred rites or picaresque stories.[1]Jaume Albero Poveda similarly calls the ""comical episodes"" like the riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum ""typical of the picaresque novel"".[71]19th century fiction[edit]Further information:Tolkien's modern sourcesBilbo's character and adventures match many details ofWilliam Morris's expedition in Iceland.[72]1870 cartoon of Morris riding a pony by his travelling companionEdward Burne-JonesTolkienwished to imitate the prose and poetry romancesof the 19th-centuryArts and CraftspolymathWilliam Morris[73]in style and approach. The Desolation of Smaug, portraying dragons as detrimental to landscape, is a motif explicitly borrowed from Morris.[74]The Tolkien scholarMarjorie Burnswrites that Bilbo's character and adventures match many details of Morris's expedition in Iceland. She comments, for instance, that the humorous drawings of Morris riding through the wilds ofIcelandby his friend the artistEdward Burne-Jonescan serve well as models for Bilbo on his adventures.[72]Tolkien wrote of being impressed as a boy bySamuel Rutherford Crockett's historical novelThe Black Douglasand of basing the Necromancer—Sauron—on its villain,Gilles de Retz.[75]Incidents in bothThe HobbitandLord of the Ringsare similar in narrative and style to the novel,[76]and its overall style and imagery have been suggested as having had an influence on Tolkien.[77]Verne's runic cryptogram fromJourney to the Center of the EarthTheTolkien scholarMark T. Hooker has catalogued a lengthy series of parallels betweenThe HobbitandJules Verne's 1864Journey to the Center of the Earth. These include, among other things, a hidden runic message and a celestial alignment that direct the adventurers to the goals of their quests.[78]Tolkien's portrayal of goblins inThe Hobbitwas particularly influenced byGeorge MacDonald'sThe Princess and the Goblin.[79]However, MacDonald's influence on Tolkien was more profound than the shaping of individual characters and episodes; his works helped Tolkien form his whole thinking on the role offantasy within his Christian faith.[80]Critical analysis[edit]Themes[edit]Further information:Psychological journeys of Middle-earthThe evolution and maturation of the protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, is central to the story. This journey of maturation, where Bilbo gains a clear sense of identity and confidence in the outside world, may be seenin psychological termsas aBildungsromanrather than a traditional quest.[81]TheJungianconcept ofindividuationis also reflected through this theme of growing maturity and capability, with the author contrasting Bilbo's personal growth against the arrested development of the dwarves.[82]Thus, while Gandalf exerts a parental influence over Bilbo early on, it is Bilbo who gradually takes over leadership of the party, a fact the dwarves could not bear to acknowledge.[83]The analogue of the ""underworld"" and the hero returning from it with a boon (such as the ring, or Elvish blades) that benefits his society is seen to fit the mythicarchetypesregarding initiation and malecoming-of-ageas described byJoseph Campbell.[51]Chance compares the development and growth of Bilbo against other characters to the concepts of just kingship versus sinful kingship derived from theAncrene Wisse(which Tolkien had written on in 1929), and a Christian understanding ofBeowulf.[84]Shippey comments that Bilbo is nothing like a king, and that Chance's talk of ""types"" just muddies the waters, though he agrees with her that there are ""self-images of Tolkien"" throughout his fiction; and she is right, too, in seeing Middle-earth as a balance between creativity and scholarship, ""Germanic past and Christian present"".[85]The overcoming of greed and selfishness has been seen as the central moral of the story.[86]Whilst greed is a recurring theme in the novel, with many of the episodes stemming from one or more of the characters' simple desire for food (be it trolls eating dwarves or dwarves eating Wood-elf fare) or a desire for beautiful objects, such as gold and jewels,[87]it is only by the Arkenstone's influence upon Thorin that greed, and its attendant vices ""coveting"" and ""malignancy"", come fully to the fore in the story and provide the moral crux of the tale. Bilbo steals the Arkenstone—a most ancient relic of the dwarves—and attempts to ransom it to Thorin for peace. However, Thorin turns on the Hobbit as a traitor, disregarding all the promises and ""at your services"" he had previously bestowed.[88]In the end Bilbo gives up the precious stone and most of his share of the treasure to help those in greater need. Tolkien also explores the motif of jewels that inspire intense greed that corrupts those who covet them in theSilmarillion, and there are connections between the words ""Arkenstone"" and ""Silmaril"" in Tolkien's invented etymologies.[89]The Hobbitemploys themes ofanimism. An important concept inanthropologyandchild development, animism is the idea that all things—including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things like animals and plants—possess human-like intelligence.John D. Rateliffcalls this the ""Doctor DolittleTheme"" inThe History of The Hobbit, and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These sapient beings include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves.Patrick Currynotes that animism is also found in Tolkien's other works, and mentions the ""roots of mountains"" and ""feet of trees"" inThe Hobbitas a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate.[90]Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: ""...The first men to talk of 'trees and stars' saw things very differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was 'myth-woven and elf-patterned'.""[91]Interpretation[edit]Further information:The Great War and Middle-earthAs in plot and setting, Tolkien brings his literary theories to bear in forming characters and their interactions. He portrays Bilbo as a modernanachronismexploring an essentially antique world. Bilbo is able to negotiate and interact within this antique world because language and tradition make connections between the two worlds. For example,Gollum's riddles are taken from old historical sources, while those of Bilbo come from modern nursery books. It is the form of the riddle game, familiar to both, which allows Gollum and Bilbo to engage each other, rather than the content of the riddles themselves. This idea of a superficial contrast between characters' individual linguistic style, tone and sphere of interest, leading to an understanding of the deeper unity between the ancient and modern, is a recurring theme inThe Hobbit.[61]Smaugis the main antagonist. In many ways the Smaug episodereflects and references the dragonofBeowulf, and Tolkien uses the episode to put into practice some of the ground-breaking literary theories he had developed about the Old English poem in its portrayal of the dragon as having bestial intelligence.[63]Tolkien greatly prefers this motif over the later medieval trend of using the dragon as a symbolic or allegorical figure, such as in the legend ofSaint George and the Dragon.[92]Smaug the dragon with his golden hoard may be seen as an example of the traditional relationship between evil and metallurgy as collated in the depiction ofPandæmoniumwith its ""Belched fire and rolling smoke"" inJohn Milton'sParadise Lost.[93]Of all the characters, Smaug's speech is the most modern, usingidiomssuch as ""Don't let your imagination run away with you!""Just as Tolkien's literary theories have been seen to influence the tale, so have Tolkien's experiences.The Hobbitmay be read as Tolkien's parable of World War I with the hero being plucked from his rural home and thrown into a far-off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile.[94]The tale as such explores the theme of heroism. AsJanet Brennan Croftnotes,Tolkien's literary reaction to warat this time differed from most post-war writers by eschewing irony as a method for distancing events and instead using mythology to mediate his experiences.[95]Similarities to the works of other writers who faced the First World War are seen inThe Hobbit, including portraying warfare as anti-pastoral: in ""The Desolation of Smaug"", both the area under the influence of Smaug before his demise and the setting for the Battle of Five Armies later are described as barren, damaged landscapes.[96]The Hobbitmakes a warning against repeating the tragedies of the First World War,[97]and Tolkien's attitude as a veteran may well be summed up by Bilbo's comment: ""Victory after all, I suppose! Well, it seems a very gloomy business.""[95]Reception[edit]On its publication in October 1937,The Hobbitwas met with almost unanimously favourable reviews from publications both in Britain and America, includingThe Times,Catholic World, andNew York Post.C. S. Lewis, friend of Tolkien (and later author ofThe Chronicles of Narniabetween 1949 and 1954), writing inThe Timesreports:The truth is that in this book a number of good things, never before united, have come together: a fund of humour, an understanding of children, and a happy fusion of the scholar's with the poet's grasp of mythology... The professor has the air of inventing nothing. He has studied trolls and dragons at first hand and describes them with that fidelity that is worth oceans of glib ""originality.""Lewis compares the book toAlice in Wonderlandin that both children and adults may find different things to enjoy in it, and places it alongsideFlatland,Phantastes, andThe Wind in the Willows.[98]W. H. Auden, in his review of the sequelThe Fellowship of the Ring, callsThe Hobbit""one of the best children's stories of this century"".[99]Auden was later to correspond with Tolkien, and they became friends.The Hobbitwas nominated for the Carnegie Medal,[100]and awarded a  prize from theNew York Herald Tribunefor best juvenile fiction of 1938.[101]More recently, the book has been recognized as ""Most Important 20th-Century Novel (for Older Readers)"" in theChildren's Books of the Centurypoll inBooks for Keeps.[102]In 2012 it was ranked number 14 on a list of the top 100 children's novels published bySchool Library Journal.[103]Publication of the sequelThe Lord of the Ringsaltered many critics' reception of the work. Instead of approachingThe Hobbitas a children's book in its own right, critics such asRandel Helmspicked up on the idea ofThe Hobbitas being a ""prelude"", relegating the story to a dry-run for the later work. Countering apresentistinterpretation are those who say this approach misses out on much of the original's value as a children's book and as a work of high fantasy in its own right, and that it disregards the book's influence on these genres.[47]Commentators such asPaul Kocher,[104]John D. Rateliff[105]and C. W. Sullivan[47]encourage readers to treat the works separately, both becauseThe Hobbitwas conceived, published, and received independently of the later work, and to avoid dashing readers' expectations of tone and style.Publication[edit]Further information:English-language editions ofThe HobbitDustcover of the first edition ofThe Hobbit, taken from a design by the authorGeorge Allen & Unwin published the first edition ofThe Hobbiton 21 September 1937 with a print run of 1,500 copies, which sold out by December because of enthusiastic reviews.[106]This first printing was illustrated in black and white by Tolkien, who designed thedust jacketas well.Houghton Mifflinof Boston and New York reset type for an American edition, to be released early in 1938, in which four ofthe illustrationswould be colour plates. Allen & Unwin decided to incorporate the colour illustrations into their second printing, released at the end of 1937.[107]Despite the book's popularity, paperrationing due to World War IIand not ending until 1949 meant that the Allen & Unwin edition of the book was often unavailable during this period.[20]Subsequenteditionsin English were published in 1951, 1966, 1978, and 1995. NumerousEnglish-language editions ofThe Hobbithave been produced by several publishers,[108]making it one of thebest-selling books of all timewith over 100 million copies sold by 2012.[109][110][111]In addition,The Hobbithas beentranslated into over sixty languages, with more than one published version for some languages.[112]Revisions[edit]Navigable diagram ofTolkien's legendarium.The Hobbitbegan as a stand-alone story, but with the writing ofThe Lord of the Rings, Tolkien felt the need to bring it into closer alignment with that work.In December 1937The Hobbit'spublisher,Stanley Unwin, asked Tolkien for a sequel. In response Tolkien provided drafts forThe Silmarillion, but the editors rejected them, believing that the public wanted ""more about hobbits"".[113]Tolkien subsequently began work onThe New Hobbit, which would eventually becomeThe Lord of the Rings,[113]a course that would not only change the context of the original story, but lead to substantial changes to the character ofGollum.In the first edition ofThe Hobbit, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably.[8]In the second edition edits, to reflect the new concept of theOne Ringand its corrupting abilities, Tolkien made Gollum more aggressive towards Bilbo and distraught at losing the ring. The encounter ends with Gollum's curse, ""Thief! Thief, Thief, Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!"" This presages Gollum's portrayal inThe Lord of the Rings.[114]Tolkien sent this revised version of the chapter ""Riddles in the Dark"" to Unwin as an example of the kinds of changes needed to bring the book into conformity withThe Lord of the Rings,[115]but he heard nothing back for years. When he was sentgalley proofsof a new edition, Tolkien was surprised to find that the sample text had been incorporated.[116]InThe Lord of the Rings, the original version of the riddle game is explained as a lie made up by Bilbo under the harmful influence of the Ring, whereas the revised version contains the ""true"" account.[117]The revised text became the second edition, published in 1951 in both the UK and the US.[118]Tolkien began a new version in 1960, attempting to adjust the tone ofThe Hobbitto its sequel. He abandoned the new revision at chapter three after he received criticism that it ""just wasn'tThe Hobbit"", implying it had lost much of its light-hearted tone and quick pace.[119]After an unauthorized paperback edition ofThe Lord of the Ringsappeared fromAce Booksin 1965, Houghton Mifflin andBallantine Booksasked Tolkien to refresh the text ofThe Hobbitto renew the US copyright.[120]This text became the 1966 third edition. Tolkien took the opportunity to align the narrative more closely toThe Lord of the Ringsand to cosmological developments from his still unpublishedQuenta Silmarillionas it stood at that time.[121]These were mostly small edits; for example, changing the phrase ""elves that are now called Gnomes"" from the first,[122]and second editions,[123]on page 63, to ""High Elves of the West, my kin"" in the third edition.[124]Tolkien had used ""gnome"" in his earlier writing to refer to the second kindred of theHigh Elves—theNoldor(or ""Deep Elves"")—thinking that ""gnome"", derived from the Greekgnosis(knowledge), was a good name for the wisest of the elves. However, because of the term's association withgarden gnomes, Tolkien abandoned the term.[125]This edition also introduced a new version of the history of Erebor. In the original story, Erebor was founded by Thorin's grandfather Thror, and the Arkenstone discovered by his father Thrain. However, to correct a note on the map saying that Thrain had been King Under the Mountain, Tolkien introduced a distant ancestor Thrain I in the third edition text, who both founded the kingdom and discovered the Arkenstone.[126]Posthumous critical editions[edit]Since Tolkien's death, two critical editions ofThe Hobbithave been published, providing commentary on the creation, emendation and development of the text. In his 1988The Annotated Hobbit,Douglas Andersonprovides the text of the published book alongside commentary and illustrations. Later editions added the text of ""The Quest of Erebor"". Anderson's commentary makes note of the sources Tolkien brought together in preparing the text, and chronicles the changes Tolkien made to the published editions. The text is accompanied by illustrations from foreign language editions, among them works byTove Jansson.[127]WithThe History of The Hobbit, published in two parts in 2007,John D. Rateliffprovides the full text of the earliest and intermediary drafts of the book, alongside commentary that shows relationships to Tolkien's scholarly and creative works, both contemporary and later. In addition, Rateliff provides the abandoned 1960s retelling of the first three chapters, which sought to harmoniseThe HobbitwithThe Lord of the Rings, and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien. The book separates commentary from Tolkien's text, allowing the reader to read the original drafts as self-contained stories.[59]Commercial success and collectors' market[edit]Further information:English-language editions ofThe HobbitWhile reliable figures are difficult to obtain, estimated global sales ofThe Hobbitrun between 35[90]and 100[128]million copies since 1937. In the UKThe Hobbithas not retreated from the top 5,000 bestselling books measured byNielsen BookScansince 1998, when the index began,[129]achieving a three-year sales peak rising from 33,084 (2000) to 142,541 (2001), 126,771 (2002) and 61,229 (2003), ranking it at the 3rd position in Nielsen's ""Evergreen"" book list.[130]The enduring popularity ofThe Hobbitmakes early printings of the book attractive collectors' items. The first printing of the first English-language edition can sell for between £6,000 and £20,000 at auction,[131][132]while the price for a signed first edition has reached over £60,000.[128]Legacy[edit]The Lord of the Rings[edit]Further information:Quests in Middle-earthThe Hobbit'ssequelThe Lord of the Ringsis often claimed to be its greatest legacy. The plots share the same basic structure in the same sequence: thestories are both questsstarting at Bag End, the home of Bilbo Baggins; Bilbo hosts a party that sets the novel's main plot into motion; Gandalf sends the protagonist into a quest eastward; Elrond offers a haven and advice; the adventurers escape dangerous creatures underground (Goblin Town/Moria); they engage another group of elves (Mirkwood/Lothlórien); they traverse a desolate region (Desolation of Smaug/theDead Marshes); they are received and nourished by a small settlement of men (Esgaroth/Ithilien); they fight in a massive battle (The Battle of Five Armies/Battle of Pelennor Fields); their journey climaxes within an infamous mountain peak (Lonely Mountain/Mount Doom); a descendant of kings is restored to his ancestral throne (Bard/Aragorn); and the questing party returns home to find it in a deteriorated condition (having possessions auctioned off/the Scouring of the Shire). Scholars includingPaul H. KocherandRandel Helmshave documented the similarities.[133][134]Randel Helms's analysis ofquest structureinThe HobbitandThe Lord of the Rings[134]EventThe HobbitThe Lord of the RingsStartFromBag Endinthe ShireEnd of 1st phaseTrip down River Running, nearingEreborTrip downRiver Anduin, nearingMordorApproaching the goalCrossthe dragon's withered heathCross the evil polluted plain ofGorgorothAchieving the questEnter hole in side of theLonely MountainEnter hole in side ofMount DoomSuccess marked byArrival ofGreat EaglesReturning homeHave to stop auction ofBag EndHave toscour the Shireof Sharkey's evilThe Lord of the Ringscontains several more supporting scenes, and has a moresophisticated plot structure, following the paths of multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The differences between the two stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not.[133]Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wroteThe Hobbitas a story for children, andThe Lord of the Ringsfor the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept ofMiddle-earthwas to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.[135]In education[edit]The style and themes of the book have been seen to help stretch young readers' literacy skills, preparing them to approach the works ofCharles DickensandWilliam Shakespeare. Further, it may exercise the reading skills of advanced younger readers better than much modern fiction for teenagers.[136]Educationalists have seenThe Hobbitas a means to encourage literacy among 11- to 14-year-old boys in particular.[137]Adaptations[edit]Main article:Adaptations ofThe HobbitThe Hobbithas been adapted many times for a variety of media, starting with a March 1953 stage production bySt. Margaret's School, Edinburgh.[108]The first motion picture adaptation ofThe HobbitwasGene Deitch's 1966short film of cartoon stills.[138]In 1968,BBC Radio 4broadcastan 8-part radio drama versionbyMichael Kilgarriff.[139]In 1974,Nicol Williamsonrecorded an abridged version of the book on 4long-playing recordsfor theArgo Recordslabel, voicing all the characters.[140]In 1977,Rankin/Bassmade ananimated filmbased on the book. In 1978,Romeo Mullerwon aPeabody Awardfor histeleplay, though critics described it as ""execrable""[112]and ""confusing"".[141]A children's opera composed byDean Burryappeared in 2004 inToronto.[142]Between 2012 and 2014,Peter Jackson's three-partlive-action film versionappeared on cinema screens.[143][144]Several computer and video games have been based on the story, including a1982 gamebyBeam Software.[145][146][147][148]During theCOVID-19 lockdown,Andy Serkisread the whole ofThe Hobbitto raise money for charity.[149]He then recorded the work again as an audiobook,[150][151]with cover art byAlan Lee.[152]See also[edit]Middle-earth in filmNotes[edit]^The names derive directly from theOld NorsenamesFíli,Kíli,Oin,Glói,Bivör,Bávörr,Bömburr,Dori,Nóri,Dvalinn,Bláin,Dain,Nain,Þorin,Eikinskialdi, andGandálfrin theDvergatal, the list of Dwarves in theVöluspáwithin thePoetic Edda.[55][56]References[edit]^abcHodge, James L.

Books,Fahrenheit_451,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451,Fahrenheit 451,"1953 dystopian novel by Ray BradburyThis article is about the novel. For other uses, seeFahrenheit 451 (disambiguation).Fahrenheit 451First edition cover (clothbound)AuthorRay BradburyIllustratorJoseph Mugnaini[1]LanguageEnglishGenreDystopian[2]PublishedOctober 19, 1953 (Ballantine Books)[3]Publication placeUnited StatesPages156ISBN978-0-7432-4722-1(current cover edition)OCLC53101079Dewey Decimal813.54 22LC ClassPS3503.R167 F3 2003Fahrenheit 451is a 1953dystopiannovelby American writerRay Bradbury.[4]It presents a future American society wherebookshave been outlawed and ""firemen""burn any that are found.[5]The novel follows in the viewpoint ofGuy Montag, a fireman who becomes disillusioned with his role of censoring literature and destroying knowledge, eventually quitting his job and committing himself to thepreservationofliteraryandculturalwritings.Fahrenheit 451was written by Bradbury during theSecond Red Scareand theMcCarthy era, inspired by thebook burnings in Nazi Germanyand byideological repression in the Soviet Union.[6]Bradbury's claimed motivation for writing the novel has changed multiple times. In a 1956 radio interview, Bradbury said that he wrote the book because of his concerns about the threat ofburning books in the United States.[7]In later years, he described the book as a commentary on howmass mediareduces interest in reading literature.[8]In a 1994 interview, Bradbury citedpolitical correctnessas an allegory for the censorship in the book, calling it ""the real enemy these days"" and labeling it as ""thought controlandfreedom of speechcontrol"".[9]The writing and theme withinFahrenheit 451was explored by Bradbury in some of his previous short stories. Between 1947 and 1948, Bradbury wrote ""Bright Phoenix"", a short story about a librarian who confronts a ""Chief Censor"", who burns books. An encounter Bradbury had in 1949 with the police inspired him to write the short story ""The Pedestrian"" in 1951. In ""The Pedestrian"", a man going for a nighttime walk in his neighborhood is harassed and detained by the police. In the society of ""The Pedestrian"", citizens are expected to watch television as a leisurely activity, a detail that would be included inFahrenheit 451. Elements of both ""Bright Phoenix"" and ""The Pedestrian"" would be combined intoThe Fireman, anovellapublished inGalaxy Science Fictionin 1951. Bradbury was urged byStanley Kauffmann, an editor atBallantine Books, to makeThe Firemaninto a full novel. Bradbury finished the manuscript forFahrenheit 451in 1953, and the novel was published later that year.Upon its release,Fahrenheit 451was a critical success, albeit with notable dissenters; the novel's subject matter led to its censorship inapartheidSouth Africaand various schools in the United States.[citation needed]In 1954,Fahrenheit 451won theAmerican Academy of Arts and LettersAward in Literature and theCommonwealth Club of CaliforniaGold Medal.[10][11][12]It later won thePrometheus ""Hall of Fame"" Awardin 1984[13]and a""Retro"" Hugo Awardin 2004.[14]Bradbury was honored with aSpoken WordGrammy nominationfor his 1976audiobookversion.[15]The novel has been adapted into films,stage plays, andvideo games. Film adaptations of the novel include a1966 filmdirected byFrançois TruffautstarringOskar Werneras Guy Montag and a2018 television filmdirected byRamin BahranistarringMichael B. Jordanas Montag, both of which received a mixed critical reception. Bradbury himself published a stage play version in 1979 and helped develop a 1984interactive fictionvideo game of the same name, as well as a collection of hisshort storiestitledA Pleasure to Burn.[16]TwoBBC Radiodramatizationswere also produced.Historical and biographical context[edit]Further information:Second Red Scare,Nazi book burnings, andideological repression in the Soviet UnionTheNazi book burningshorrifiedRay Bradburyand inspired him to writeFahrenheit 451TheHouse Un-American Activities Committee(HUAC), formed in 1938 to investigate American citizens and organizations suspected of having communist ties, held hearings in 1947 to investigate alleged communist influence in Hollywood movie-making.[17]The government's interference in the affairs of artists and creative types infuriated Bradbury;[18]he was concerned about the workings of his government, and a late 1949 nighttime encounter with an overzealous police officer would inspire Bradbury to write ""The Pedestrian"", a short story which would go on to become ""The Fireman"" and thenFahrenheit 451. The rise of SenatorJoseph McCarthy'sMcCarthyismpersecution of accused communists, beginning in 1950, deepened Bradbury's contempt for government overreach.[19][20]TheGolden Age of Radiooccurred between the early 1920s to the late 1950s, during Bradbury's early life, while the transition to theGolden Age of Televisionbegan right around the time he started to work on the stories that would eventually lead toFahrenheit 451. Bradbury saw these forms of media as a threat to the reading of books, indeed as a threat to society, as he believed they could act as a distraction from important affairs. This contempt formass mediaand technology would express itself through Mildred and her friends and is an important theme in the book.[21]Bradbury's lifelong passion for books began at an early age. After he graduated from high school, his family could not afford for him to attend college, so Bradbury began spending time at theLos Angeles Public Librarywhere he educated himself.[22]As a frequent visitor to his local libraries in the 1920s and 1930s, he recalls being disappointed because they did not stock popular science fiction novels, like those ofH. G. Wells, because, at the time, they were not deemed literary enough. Between this and learning about the destruction of theLibrary of Alexandria,[23]a great impression was made on Bradbury about the vulnerability of books to censure and destruction.Later, as a teenager, Bradbury was horrified by theNazi book burningsstating, ""When I was fifteen years old, Hitler burned books in the streets of Berlin. And it terrified me"".[24]Bradbury was also influenced byJoseph Stalin's campaign of political repression, theGreat Purge, in which writers and poets, among many others, were arrested and often executed, stating, ""They burned the authors instead of the books.""[6]Plot summary[edit]""The Hearth and the Salamander""[edit]In a distant future,[note 1][25]Guy Montagis a fireman employed to burn outlawed books, along with the houses they are hidden in. One fall night while returning from work, he meets his new neighbor Clarisse McClellan, whose free-thinking ideals and liberating spirit cause him to question his life and perceived happiness. Montag returns home to find that his wife Mildred has overdosed on sleeping pills, and he calls for medical attention. TwoEMTspump her stomach and change her blood. After they leave to rescue another overdose victim, Montag overhears Clarisse and her family talking about their illiterate society. Shortly afterward, Montag's mind is bombarded with Clarisse's subversive thoughts and the memory of Mildred's near-death. Over the next few days, Clarisse meets Montag each night as he walks home. Clarisse's simple pleasures and interests make her an outcast among her peers, and she is forced to go to therapy for her behavior. Montag looks forward to the meetings, but one day, Clarisse goes missing.[26]In the following days, while he and other firemen are ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman and drenching it in kerosene, Montag steals a book. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match andburn herself alive. Jarred by the suicide, Montag returns home and hides the book under his pillow. Montag asks Mildred if she has heard anything about Clarisse. She reveals that Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of ""The Mechanical Hound"", an eight-legged[27]robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen in hunting book hoarders.Montag awakens ill the next morning. Mildred tries to care for her husband but finds herself more involved in the ""parlor wall"" entertainment in the living room – large televisions filling the walls. Montag suggests he should take a break from being a fireman, and Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall ""family"". Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing his concerns, Beatty recounts the history of how books had lost their value and how the firemen were adapted for their current role: over decades, people began to embrace new media (like film and television), sports, and an ever-quickening pace of life. Books were abridged or degraded to accommodate shorterattention spans. At the same time, advances in technology resulted in nearly all buildings being made with fireproof materials, and firemen preventing fires were no longer necessary. The government then instead turned the firemen into officers of society's peace of mind: instead of putting out fires, they were charged with starting them, specifically to burn books, which were condemned as sources of confusing and depressing thoughts that complicated people's lives. After an awkward exchange between Mildred and Montag over the book hidden under his pillow, Beatty becomes suspicious and casually adds a passing threat before leaving; he says that if a fireman had a book, he would be asked to burn it within the following twenty-four hours. If he refused, the other firemen would come and burn it for him. The encounter leaves Montag shaken.Montag reveals to Mildred that, over the last year, he has accumulated books that are hidden in their ceiling. In a panic, Mildred grabs a book and rushes to throw it in the kitchen incinerator, but Montag subdues her and says they are going to read the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned and their lives will return to normal.""The Sieve and the Sand""[edit]Mildred refuses to go along with Montag's plan, questioning why she or anyone else should care about books. Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the woman who burned herself, and the imminent war that goes ignored by the masses. He suggests that perhaps the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. Mildred remains unconvinced.Conceding that Mildred is a lost cause, Montag needs help to understand the books. He remembers an old man named Faber, an English professor before books were banned, whom he once met in a park. Montag visits Faber's home carrying a copy of theBible, the book he stole at the woman's house. Once there, after multiple attempts to ask, Montag forces the scared and reluctant Faber into helping him by methodically ripping pages from the Bible. Faber concedes and gives Montag a homemade earpiece communicator so that he can offer constant guidance.At home, Mildred's friends, Mrs. Bowles and Mrs. Phelps, arrive to watch the ""parlor walls"". Not interested in this entertainment, Montag turns off the walls and tries to engage the women in meaningful conversation, only for them to reveal just how indifferent, ignorant, and callous they truly are. Enraged, Montag shows them a book of poetry. This confuses the women and alarms Faber, who is listening remotely. Mildred tries to dismiss Montag's actions as a tradition firemen act out once a year: they find an old book and read it as a way to make fun of how silly the past is. Montag proceeds to recite a poem,[note 2]causing Mrs. Phelps to cry. The two women leave.Montag hides his books in the backyard before returning to the firehouse late at night. There, Montag hands Beatty a book to cover for the one he believes Beatty knows he stole the night before, which is tossed into the trash. Beatty reveals that, despite his disillusionment, he was once an enthusiastic reader. A fire alarm sounds and Beatty picks up the address from the dispatcher system. They drive in the fire truck to the unexpected destination: Montag's house.""Burning Bright""[edit]Beatty orders Montag to destroy his house with aflamethrower, rather than the more powerful ""salamander"" that is usually used by the fire team, and tells him that his wife and her friends reported him. Montag watches as Mildred walks out of the house, too traumatized about losing her parlor wall 'family' to even acknowledge her husband's existence or the situation going on around her, and catches a taxi. Montag complies, destroying the home piece by piece, but Beatty discovers his earpiece and plans to hunt down Faber. Montag threatens Beatty with the flamethrower and, after Beatty taunts him, Montag burns Beatty alive. As Montag tries to escape the scene, the Mechanical Hound attacks him, managing to inject his leg with an anesthetic. He destroys the Hound with the flamethrower and limps away. While escaping, Montag concludes that Beatty wanted to die a long time ago, having goaded him and provided him with a weapon.Montag runs towards Faber's house. En route, he crosses a road as a car attempts to run him over, but he manages to evade the vehicle, almost suffering the same fate as Clarisse and losing his knee. Faber urges him to make his way to the countryside and contact a group of exiledbook-loverswho live there. Faber plans to leave on a bus heading toSt. Louis,Missouri, where he and Montag can rendezvous later. Meanwhile, another Mechanical Hound is released to track down and kill Montag, with news helicopters following it to create a public spectacle. After wiping his scent from around the house in hopes of thwarting the Hound, Montag leaves. He escapes the manhunt by wading into a river and floating downstream, where he meets the book-lovers. They predicted Montag's arrival while watching the TV.The drifters are all former intellectuals. They have each memorized books should the day arrive that society comes to an end, with the survivors learning to embrace the literature of the past. Wanting to contribute to the group, Montag finds that he partially memorized theBook of Ecclesiastes, discovering that the group has a special way of unlocking photographic memory. While discussing about their learnings, Montag and the group watch helplessly as bombers fly overhead and annihilate the city with nuclear weapons: the war has begun and ended in the same night. While Faber would have left on the early bus, everyone else (possibly including Mildred) is killed. Injured and dirtied, Montag and the group manage to survive theshockwave.When the war is over, the exiles return to the city to rebuild society.Characters[edit]Guy Montagis theprotagonistand a fireman who presents the dystopian world in which he lives first through the eyes of a worker loyal to it, then as a man in conflict about it, and eventually as someone resolved to be free of it. Throughout most of the book, Montag lacks knowledge and believes only what he hears. Clarisse McClellan inspires Montag's change, even though they do not know each other for very long.Clarisse McClellanis a teenage girl one month short of her 17th birthday[note 3]who is Montag's neighbor.[28]She walks with Montag on his trips home from work. A modern critic has described her as an example of theManic Pixie Dream Girl,[29]as Clarisse is an unusual sort of person compared to the others inhabiting the bookless, hedonistic society: outgoing, naturally cheerful, unorthodox, and intuitive. She is unpopular among peers and disliked by teachers for asking ""why"" instead of ""how"" and focusing on nature rather than on technology. A few days after her first meeting with Montag, she disappears without any explanation; Mildred tells Montag (and Captain Beatty confirms) that Clarisse was hit by a speeding car and that her family moved away following her death. It is implied that Beatty may have assassinated Clarisse. In the afterword of a later edition, Bradbury notes that the1966 film adaptationchanged the ending so that Clarisse (who, in the film, is now a 20-year-old schoolteacher who was fired for being unorthodox) was living with the exiles. Bradbury, far from being displeased by this, was so happy with the new ending that he wrote it into his later stage edition.Mildred ""Millie"" Montagis Guy Montag's wife. She is addicted to sleeping pills, absorbed in the shallow dramas played on her ""parlor walls"" (large, flat-panel televisions), and indifferent to the oppressive society around her. She is described in the book as ""thin as apraying mantisfrom dieting, her hair burnt by chemicals to a brittle straw, and her flesh like white bacon."" Despite her husband's attempts to break her from the spell society has on her, Mildred continues to be shallow and indifferent. After Montag scares her friends away by readingDover Beach, and finding herself unable to live with someone who has been hoarding books, Mildred betrays Montag by reporting him to the firemen and abandoning him, and presumably dies when the city is bombed.Captain Beattyis Montag's boss and the book's mainantagonist. Once an avid reader, he has come to hate books due to their unpleasant content and contradicting facts and opinions. After he forces Montag to burn his own house, Montag kills him with a flamethrower. In a scene written years later by Bradbury for theFahrenheit 451play, Beatty invites Montag to his house where he shows him walls of books left to molder on their shelves.StonemanandBlackare Montag's coworkers at the firehouse. They do not have a large impact on the story and function only to show the reader the contrast between the firemen who obediently do as they are told and someone like Montag, who formerly took pride in his job but subsequently realizes how damaging it is to society. Black is later framed by Montag for possessing books.Faberis a former English professor. He has spent years regretting that he did not defend books when he saw the moves to ban them. Montag turns to him for guidance, remembering him from a chance meeting in a park sometime earlier. Faber at first refuses to help Montag and later realizes Montag is only trying to learn about books, not destroy them. He secretly communicates with Montag through an electronic earpiece and helps Montag escape the city, then gets on a bus toSt. Louisand escapes the city himself before it is bombed. Bradbury notes in his afterword that Faber is part of the name of a German manufacturer of pencils,Faber-Castell; it is also the name of a publishing company,Faber and Faber.Mrs. Ann BowlesandMrs. Clara Phelpsare Mildred's friends and representative of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic mainstream society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring the bad things in their lives and have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he will be back in a week because of how quick the war will be) and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a three-times-married single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and she's glad she can hit back. When Montag readsDover Beachto them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who starts crying over how hollow her life is. Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading ""silly awful hurting words"".Grangeris the leader of a group of wandering intellectual exiles who memorize books in order to preserve their contents.Title[edit]The title page of the book explains the title as follows:Fahrenheit 451—The temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns.... On inquiring about the temperature at which paper would catch fire, Bradbury had been told that 451 °F (233 °C) was theautoignition temperatureof paper.[30][31]In various studies, scientists have placed the autoignition temperature at a range of temperatures between 424 and 475 °F (218 and 246 °C), depending on the type of paper.[32][33]Writing and development[edit]Fahrenheit 451developed out of a series of ideas Bradbury had visited in previously written stories. For many years, he tended to single out ""The Pedestrian"" in interviews and lectures as sort of a proto-Fahrenheit 451. In the preface of his 2006 anthologyMatch to Flame: The Fictional Paths to Fahrenheit 451he states that this is an oversimplification.[34]The full genealogy ofFahrenheit 451given inMatch to Flameis involved. The following covers the most salient aspects.[35]Between 1947 and 1948,[36]Bradbury wrote the short story ""Bright Phoenix"" (not published until the May 1963 issue ofThe Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction[37][38]) about a librarian who confronts a book-burning ""Chief Censor"" named Jonathan Barnes.In late 1949,[39]Bradbury was stopped and questioned by a police officer while walking late one night.[40][41]When asked ""What are you doing?"", Bradbury wisecracked, ""Putting one foot in front of another.""[40][41]This incident inspired Bradbury to write the 1951 short story ""The Pedestrian"".[note 4][40][41]In ""The Pedestrian"", Leonard Mead is harassed and detained by the city's only remotely operated police cruiser for taking nighttime walks, something that has become extremely rare in this future-based setting, as everybody else stays inside and watches television (""viewing screens""). Alone and without analibi, Mead is taken to the ""Psychiatric Center for Research on Regressive Tendencies"" for his peculiar habit.Fahrenheit 451echoed this theme of anauthoritariansociety distracted bybroadcast media.[citation needed][42]Bradbury expanded the book-burning premise of ""Bright Phoenix""[43]and thetotalitarianfuture of ""The Pedestrian""[44]into ""The Fireman"", anovellapublished in the February 1951 issue ofGalaxy Science Fiction.[45][46]""The Fireman"" was written in the basement ofUCLA'sPowell Libraryon a typewriter that he rented for a fee of ten cents per half hour.[47]The first draft was 25,000 words long and was completed in nine days.[48]Urged by a publisher atBallantine Booksto double the length of his story to make a novel, Bradbury returned to the same typing room and made the story 25,000 words longer, again taking nine days.[47]The title ""Fahrenheit 451"" came to him on January 22. The final manuscript was ready in mid-August, 1953.[49]The resulting novel, which some considered as afix-up[50](despite being an expanded rewrite of one single novella), was published by Ballantine in 1953.[51]Supplementary material[edit]Bradbury has supplemented the novel with variousfrontandback matter, including a 1979 coda,[52]a 1982afterword,[53]a 1993foreword, and severalintroductions.Publication history[edit]The first U.S. printing was a paperback version from October 1953 by The Ballantine Publishing Group. Shortly after the paperback, a hardback version was released that included a special edition of 200 signed and numbered copies bound inasbestos.[54][55][56]These were technically collections because the novel was published with two short stories, ""The Playground"" and ""And the Rock Cried Out"", which have been omitted from later printings.[1][57]A few months later, the novel was serialized in the March, April, and May 1954 issues of nascentPlayboymagazine.[10][58]Expurgation[edit]Starting in January 1967,Fahrenheit 451was subject toexpurgationby its publisher, Ballantine Books, with the release of the ""Bal-Hi Edition"" aimed at high school students.[59][60]Among the changes made by the publisher were thecensorshipof the words ""hell"", ""damn"", and ""abortion""; the modification of seventy-five passages; and the changing of two incidents.[60][61]In the first incident, a drunk man is changed to a ""sick man"", while the second involves cleaningfluffout of a humannavel, which instead becomes ""cleaning ears"" in the other.[60][62]For a while, both the censored and uncensored versions were available concurrently, but by 1973, Ballantine was publishing only the censored version.[62][63]That continued until 1979, when it came to Bradbury's attention:[62][63]In 1979, one of Bradbury's friends showed him an expurgated copy of the book. Bradbury demanded that Ballantine Books withdraw that version and replace it with the original, and in 1980 the original version once again became available. In this reinstated work, in the Author's Afterword, Bradbury relates to the reader that it is not uncommon for a publisher to expurgate an author's work, but he asserts that he himself will not tolerate the practice of manuscript ""mutilation"".The ""Bal-Hi"" editions are now referred to by the publisher as the ""Revised Bal-Hi"" editions.[64]Non-print publications[edit]An audiobook version read by Bradbury himself was released in 1976 and received aSpoken WordGrammy nomination.[15]Another audiobook was released in 2005 narrated by Christopher Hurt.[65]Thee-bookversion was released in December 2011.[66][67]Reception[edit]In 1954,Galaxy Science FictionreviewerGroff Conklinplaced the novel ""among the great works of the imagination written in English in the last decade or more.""[68]TheChicago Sunday Tribune'sAugust Derlethdescribed the book as ""a savage and shockingly prophetic view of one possible future way of life"", calling it ""compelling"" and praising Bradbury for his ""brilliant imagination"".[69]Over half a century later,Sam Wellerwrote, ""upon its publication,Fahrenheit 451was hailed as a visionary work of social commentary.""[70]Today,Fahrenheit 451is still viewed as an importantcautionary taleaboutconformityand the evils of government censorship.[71]When the novel was first published, there were those who did not find merit in the tale.Anthony BoucherandJ. Francis McComaswere less enthusiastic, faulting the book for being ""simply padded, occasionally with startlingly ingenious gimmickry, ... often with coruscating cascades of verbal brilliance [but] too often merely with words.""[72]Reviewing the book forAstounding Science Fiction,P. Schuyler Millercharacterized the title piece as ""one of Bradbury's bitter, almost hysterical diatribes,"" while praising its ""emotional drive and compelling, nagging detail.""[73]Similarly,The New York Timeswas unimpressed with the novel and further accused Bradbury of developing a ""virulent hatred for many aspects of present-day culture, namely, such monstrosities as radio, TV, most movies, amateur and professional sports, automobiles, and other similar aberrations which he feels debase the bright simplicity of the thinking man's existence.""[74]Fahrenheit 451was number seven on the list of ""Top Check Outs OF ALL TIME"" by theNew York Public Library[75]Censorship/banning incidents[edit]In the years since its publication,Fahrenheit 451has occasionally been banned, censored, or redacted in some schools at the behest of parents or teaching staff either unaware of or indifferent to the inherent irony in such censorship. Notable incidents include:InApartheidSouth Africa, the book was burned along with thousands of banned publications between the 1950s and 1970s.[76]In 1987,Fahrenheit 451was given ""third tier"" status by theBay County School BoardinPanama City,Florida, under superintendent Leonard Hall's new three-tier classification system. Third tier was meant for books to be removed from the classroom for ""a lot of vulgarity"". After a resident class-action lawsuit, a media stir, and student protests, the school board abandoned their tier-based censorship system and approved all the currently used books.[77]In 1992,Venado Middle SchoolinIrvine,California, gave copies ofFahrenheit 451to students with all ""obscene"" words blacked out.[78]Parents contacted the local media and succeeded in reinstalling the uncensored copies.[78]In 2006, parents of a 10th-grade high school student inMontgomery County,Texas, demanded the book be banned from their daughter's English class reading list.[79]Their daughter was assigned the book duringBanned Books Week, but stopped reading several pages in due to what she considered the offensive language and description of the burning of theBible. In addition, the parents protested the violence, portrayal of Christians, and depictions of firemen in the novel.[79]Themes[edit]Discussions aboutFahrenheit 451often center on its story foremost as a warning against state-based censorship. Indeed, when Bradbury wrote the novel during the McCarthy era, he was concerned aboutcensorship in the United States. During a radio interview in 1956,[80][81]Bradbury saidI wrote this book at a time when I was worried about the way things were going in this country four years ago. Too many people were afraid of their shadows; there was a threat of book burning. Many of the books were being taken off the shelves at that time. And of course, things have changed a lot in four years. Things are going back in a very healthy direction. But at the time I wanted to do some sort of story where I could comment on what would happen to a country if we let ourselves go too far in this direction, where then all thinking stops, and the dragon swallows his tail, and we sort of vanish into a limbo and we destroy ourselves by this sort of action.As time went by, Bradbury tended to dismiss censorship as a chief motivating factor for writing the story. Instead he usually claimed that the real messages ofFahrenheit 451were about the dangers of an illiterate society infatuated with mass media and the threat of minority and special interest groups to books. In the late 1950s, Bradbury recountedIn writing the short novelFahrenheit 451, I thought I was describing a world that might evolve in four or five decades. But only a few weeks ago, inBeverly Hillsone night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This wasnotfiction.[82]This story echoes Mildred's ""Seashell ear-thimbles"" (i.e., a brand of in-ear headphones) that act as an emotional barrier between her and Montag. In a 2007 interview, Bradbury maintained that people misinterpret his book and thatFahrenheit 451is really a statement on how mass media like television marginalizes the reading of literature.[8]Regarding minorities, he wrote in his 1979 Coda'There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority, be it Baptist/Unitarian, Irish/Italian/Octogenarian/Zen Buddhist, Zionist/Seventh-day Adventist, Women's Lib/Republican,Mattachine/Four Square Gospelfeels it has the will, the right, the duty to douse the kerosene, light the fuse. [...] Fire-Captain Beatty, in my novelFahrenheit 451, described how the books were burned first by minorities, each ripping a page or a paragraph from this book, then that, until the day came when the books were empty and the minds shut and the libraries closed forever. [...] Only six weeks ago, I discovered that, over the years, some cubby-hole editors at Ballantine Books, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some seventy-five separate sections from the novel. Students, reading the novel, which, after all, deals with censorship and book-burning in the future, wrote to tell me of this exquisite irony.Judy-Lynn del Rey, one of the new Ballantine editors, is having the entire book reset and republished this summer with all the damns and hells back in place.[83]Book-burning censorship, Bradbury would argue, was a side-effect of these two primary factors; this is consistent with Captain Beatty's speech to Montag about the history of the firemen. According to Bradbury, it is the people, not the state, who are the culprit inFahrenheit 451.[8]Fahrenheit's censorship is not the result of an authoritarian program to retain power, but the result of a fragmented society seeking to accommodate its challenges by deploying the power of entertainment and technology. As Captain Beatty explains (p. 55)...The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean.""[...] ""It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no! Technology, mass exploitation, and minority pressure carried the trick, thank God.A variety of other themes in the novel besides censorship have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores how the government is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out that the American population is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would take offense to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that, rather than the government banning books, the American population simply stopped reading on their own. He notes that the book burnings themselves became a form of entertainment for the general public.[84]In a 1994 interview, Bradbury stated thatFahrenheit 451was more relevant during this time than in any other, stating that, ""it works even better because we havepolitical correctnessnow. Political correctness is the real enemy these days. The black groups want to control our thinking and you can't say certain things. The homosexual groups don't want you to criticize them. It'sthought controlandfreedom of speechcontrol.""[9]Predictions for the future[edit]Fahrenheit 451is set in an unspecified city and time, though it is written as if set in a distant future.[note 1][25]The earliest editions make clear that it takes place no earlier than the year 2022 due to a reference to an atomic war taking place during that year.[note 5][85]Bradbury described himself as ""apreventerof futures, not a predictor of them.""[86]He did not believe that book burning was an inevitable part of the future; he wanted to warn against its development.[86]In a later interview, when asked if he believes that teachingFahrenheit 451in schools will prevent his totalitarian[2]vision of the future, Bradbury replied in the negative. Rather, he states that education must be at the kindergarten and first-grade level. If students are unable to read then, they will be unable to readFahrenheit 451.[87]As to technology, Sam Weller notes that Bradbury ""predicted everything from flat-panel televisions to earbud headphones and twenty-four-hour banking machines.""[88]Adaptations[edit]Television[edit]Playhouse 90broadcast""A Sound of Different Drummers""onCBSin 1957, written byRobert Alan Aurthur. The play combined plot ideas fromFahrenheit 451andNineteen Eighty-Four. Bradbury sued and eventually won on appeal.[89][90]Film[edit]Main articles:Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)andFahrenheit 451 (2018 film)Afilm adaptationwritten and directed byFrançois Truffautand starringOskar WernerandJulie Christiewas released in 1966.[91]Afilm adaptationdirected byRamin Bahraniand starringMichael B.

Stone(Clarisse), Michael Prichard (Captain Beatty) and Roses Prichard backstage ofFahrenheit 451by the Pandemonium Theatre Company at the Fremont Centre Theatre,Pasadena, Californiain August 2008In the late 1970s Bradbury adapted his book into a play. At least part of it was performed at the Colony Theatre inLos Angelesin 1979, but it was not in print until 1986 and the official world premiere was only in November 1988 by theFort Wayne, Indiana Civic Theatre. The stage adaptation diverges considerably from the book and seems influenced by Truffaut's movie. For example, fire chief Beatty's character is fleshed out and is the wordiest role in the play. As in the movie, Clarisse does not simply disappear but in the finale meets up with Montag as a book character (she asRobert Louis Stevenson, he asEdgar Allan Poe).[94]The UK premiere of Bradbury's stage adaptation was not until 2003 inNottingham,[94]while it took until 2006 before the Godlight Theatre Company produced and performed itsNew York Citypremiere at59E59 Theaters.[95]After the completion of the New York run, the production then transferred to theEdinburgh Festivalwhere it was a 2006 Edinburgh FestivalPick of the Fringe.[96]TheOff-BroadwaytheatreThe American Place Theatrepresented aone man showadaptation ofFahrenheit 451as a part of their 2008–2009 Literature to Life season.[97]Bradbury's Pandemonium Theatre Company[98]staged a production at the Fremont Centre Theatre inSouth Pasadenafrom April[99]through December 2008,[100][101][102]which was led by resident director Alan Neal Hubbs, produced by Bradbury and Racquel Lehrman, and starred David Polcyn (alternated with David Mauer and Lee Holmes) as Montag,[103]Mageina Tovahalternating with Tanya Mounsey as Montag's wife,Jessica D.

For other uses, seeBrave New World (disambiguation).""John the Savage"" redirects here and is not to be confused withJohn Savage (disambiguation).Brave New WorldFirst editionAuthorAldous HuxleyCover artistLeslie HollandGenreScience fiction,dystopian fictionPublisherChatto & WindusPublication date4 February 1932[1]Publication placeUnited KingdomPages311 (1932 ed.)63,766 words[2]AwardsLe Monde's 100 Books of the CenturyOCLC20156268TextBrave New WorldonlineBrave New Worldis adystopian novelby English authorAldous Huxley, written in 1931, and published in 1932.[3]Largely set in a futuristicWorld State, whose citizens are environmentally engineered into an intelligence-basedsocial hierarchy, the novel anticipates huge scientific advancements inreproductive technology,sleep-learning,psychological manipulationandclassical conditioningthat are combined to make adystopian societywhich is challenged by the story's protagonist. Huxley followed this book with a reassessment inessayform,Brave New World Revisited(1958), and with his final novel,Island(1962), theutopiancounterpart. This novel is often compared as an inversion counterpart toGeorge Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four(1949).In 1998 and 1999, theModern LibraryrankedBrave New Worldat number 5 on its list of the100 Best Novels in English of the 20th century.[4]In 2003,Robert McCrum, writing forThe Observer, includedBrave New Worldchronologically at number 53 in ""the top 100 greatest novels of all time"",[5]and the novel was listed at number 87 onThe Big Readsurvey by theBBC.[6]Brave New Worldhas frequently been banned and challenged since its original publication. It has landed on the American Library Association list of top 100 banned and challenged books of the decade since the association began the list in 1990.[7][8][9]Title[edit]The titleBrave New Worldderives fromWilliam Shakespeare'sThe Tempest, Act V, Scene I,Miranda's speech:[10]O wonder!How many goodly creatures are there here!How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,That has such people in 't.—William Shakespeare,The Tempest, Act V, Scene I, ll. 203–206[11]Shakespeare's use of the phrase is intended ironically, as the speaker is failing to recognise the evil nature of the island's visitors because of her innocence.[12]Indeed, the next speaker—Miranda's father Prospero—replies to her innocent observation with the statement""'Tis new to thee"".Translations of the title often allude to similar expressions used in domestic works of literature: the French edition of the work is entitledLe Meilleur des mondes(The Best of All Worlds), an allusion to an expression used by the philosopherGottfried Leibniz[13]and satirised inCandide, Ou l'OptimismebyVoltaire(1759). The firstStandard Chinesetranslation, done by novelist Lily Hsueh and Aaron Jen-wang Hsueh in 1974, is entitled ""美麗新世界"" (Pinyin:Měilì Xīn Shìjiè, literally ""Beautiful New World"").History[edit]Huxley wroteBrave New Worldwhile living inSanary-sur-Mer, France, in the four months from May to August 1931.[14][15][16]By this time, Huxley had established himself as a writer and social satirist. He was a contributor toVanity FairandVoguemagazines and had published a collection of his poetry (The Burning Wheel, 1916) and four satirical novels,Crome Yellow(1921),Antic Hay(1923),Those Barren Leaves(1925) andPoint Counter Point(1928).Brave New Worldwas Huxley's fifth novel and firstdystopianwork.A short passage inCrome YellowforeshadowsBrave New World, showing that Huxley had such a future in mind already in 1921. Mr Scogan, one of the earlier book's characters, describes an ""impersonal generation"" of the future that will ""take the place of Nature's hideous system. In vast state incubators, rows upon rows of gravid bottles will supply the world with the population it requires. The family system will disappear; society, sapped at its very base, will have to find new foundations; andEros, beautifully and irresponsibly free, will flit like a gay butterfly from flower to flower through a sunlit world"".Huxley said thatBrave New Worldwas inspired by theutopiannovels ofH. G. Wells, includingA Modern Utopia(1905), and as a parody ofMen Like Gods(1923).[17][18]Wells' hopeful vision of the future gave Huxley the idea to begin writing a parody of the novels, which becameBrave New World. He wrote in a letter to Mrs. Arthur Goldsmith, an American acquaintance, that he had ""been having a little fun pulling the leg of H. G. Wells"" but then he ""got caught up in the excitement of [his] own ideas"".[19]Unlike the most popular optimistic utopian novels of the time, Huxley sought to provide a frightening vision of the future. Huxley referred toBrave New Worldas a ""negative utopia"", somewhat influenced by Wells's ownThe Sleeper Awakes(dealing with subjects like corporate tyranny and behavioural conditioning) and the works ofD. H. Lawrence.[20]For his part, Wells published, two years afterBrave New World, his utopianShape of Things to Come. Seeking to rebut the argument of Huxley's Mustapha Mond—that moronic underclasses were a necessary ""social gyroscope"" and that a society composed solely of intelligent, assertive ""Alphas"" would inevitably disintegrate in internecine struggle—Wells depicted a stable egalitarian society emerging after several generations of a reforming elite having complete control of education throughout the world. In the future depicted in Wells's book, posterity remembers Huxley as ""a reactionary writer"".[21]The scientific futurism inBrave New Worldis believed to be appropriated fromDaedalus[22]byJ. B. S. Haldane.[23]The events of theGreat Depressionin Great Britain in 1931, with its mass unemployment and the abandonment of the gold standard, persuaded Huxley to assert that stability was the ""primal and ultimate need"" if civilisation was to survive the present crisis.[24]TheBrave New Worldcharacter Mustapha Mond, Resident World Controller of Western Europe, is named after SirAlfred Mond. Shortly before writing the novel, Huxley visited theBillingham Manufacturing Plant, Mond's technologically advanced factory nearBillingham, north-east England, and it made a great impression on him.[24]: xxiiHuxley used the setting and characters in his science fiction novel to express widely felt anxieties, particularly the fear of losing individual identity in the fast-paced world of the future. An early trip to the United States gaveBrave New Worldmuch of its character. Huxley was outraged by the culture of youth, commercial cheeriness, sexual promiscuity and the inward-looking nature of many Americans; he had also found the bookMy Life and WorkbyHenry Fordon the boat to North America and he saw the book's principles applied in everything he encountered after leaving San Francisco.[24]: viiiPlot[edit]The novel opens in theWorld Statecity ofLondonin AF (After Ford) 632 (AD 2540 in theGregorian calendar), where citizens are engineered throughartificial wombsand childhood indoctrination programmes into predeterminedclasses(orcastes) based on intelligence and labour.Embryosin different bottles are treated with chemicals to suit them for their planned roles; those for the higher classes get chemicals to optimise them, and those of the lower classes are made increasingly imperfect. The classes are Alpha (planned leaders), Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon (menial labourers of limited intelligence).[25]Each caste is indoctrinated to prefer their own class—epsilons are happy that they do not have the intellectual burden of alphas—and wears a uniform colour of clothing for easy identification.Lenina Crowne, a hatchery worker, is popular and sexually desirable, but Bernard Marx, a psychologist, is not. He is shorter in stature than the average member of his high alpha caste, which gives him aninferiority complex. His work withsleep-learningallows him to understand, and disapprove of, his society's methods of keeping its citizens peaceful, which includes their constant consumption of a soothing, happiness-producing drug called ""soma"". Courting disaster, Bernard is vocal and arrogant about his criticisms, and his boss contemplates exiling him toIcelandbecause of his nonconformity. His only friend is Helmholtz Watson, a gifted writer who finds it difficult to use his talents creatively in their pain-free society.
Bernard takes a holiday with Lenina outside the World State to a ""Savage Reservation"" inNew Mexico, in which the two observenatural-bornpeople, disease, the ageing process, other languages, and religious lifestyles for the first time. The culture of the village folk resembles the contemporary Native American groups of the region, descendants of theAnasazi, including thePuebloan peoplesofHopiandZuni.[26]Bernard and Lenina witness a violent public ritual and then encounter Linda, a woman originally from the World State who is living on the reservation with her son John, now a young man. She, too, visited the reservation on a holiday many years ago, but became separated from her group and was left behind. She had meanwhile become pregnant by a fellow holidaymaker (who is revealed to be Bernard's boss, the Director of Hatcheries and Conditioning). She did not try to return to the World State, because of her shame at her pregnancy. Despite spending his whole life in the reservation, John has never been accepted by the villagers, and his and Linda's lives have been hard and unpleasant. Linda has taught John to read, although from the only book in her possession—a scientific manual—and another book found nearby by Popé: the complete works of Shakespeare. Ostracised by the villagers, John is able to articulate his feelings only in terms of Shakespearean drama, quoting often fromThe Tempest,King Lear,Othello,Romeo and JulietandHamlet. Linda now wants to return to London, and John, too, wants to see this ""brave new world"" that his mother so often praised. Bernard sees an opportunity to thwart plans to exile him, and gets permission to take Linda and John back. On their return to London, John meets the Director and calls him his ""father"", a vulgarity which causes a roar of laughter. The humiliated Director resigns in shame before he can follow through with exiling Bernard.Bernard, as ""custodian"" of the ""savage"" John who is now treated as a celebrity, is fawned on by the highest members of society and revels in attention he once scorned. Bernard's popularity is fleeting, though, and he becomes envious that John only really bonds with the literary-minded Helmholtz. Considered hideous and friendless, Linda spends all her time using soma, which she craved for so long, while John refuses to attend social events organised by Bernard, appalled by what he perceives to be an empty society. Lenina and John are physically attracted to each other, but John's view of courtship and romance, based on Shakespeare's writings, is utterly incompatible with Lenina's freewheeling attitude to sex. She tries to seduce him, but he attacks her, before suddenly being informed that his mother is on her deathbed. He rushes to Linda's bedside, causing a scandal, as this is not the ""correct"" attitude to death. Some children who enter the ward for ""death-conditioning"" come across as disrespectful to John, and he attacks one physically. He then tries to break up a distribution of soma to a lower-caste group, telling them that he is freeing them. Helmholtz and Bernard rush in to stop the ensuing riot, which the police quell by spraying soma vapour into the crowd.Bernard, Helmholtz, and John are all brought before Mustapha Mond, the ""Resident World Controller for Western Europe"", who tells Bernard and Helmholtz that they are to be exiled to islands for antisocial activity. Bernard pleads for a second chance, but Helmholtz welcomes the opportunity to be a true individual, and chooses theFalkland Islandsas his destination, believing thattheir bad weatherwill inspire his writing. Mond tells Helmholtz that exile is actually a reward. The islands are full of the most interesting people in the world, individuals who did not fit into the social model of the World State. Mond outlines for John the events that led to the present society and his arguments for a caste system and social control. John rejects Mond's arguments, and Mond sums up John's views by claiming that John demands ""the right to be unhappy"". John asks if he may go to the islands as well, but Mond refuses, saying he wishes to see what happens to John next.Jaded with his new life, John moves to an abandoned hilltop lighthouse, near the village ofPuttenham, where he intends to adopt a solitaryasceticlifestyle in order to purify himself of civilisation, practisingself-flagellation. This draws reporters and eventually hundreds of amazed sightseers,hoping to witnesshis bizarre behaviour.For a while, it seems that John might be left alone, after the public's attention is drawn to other diversions, but a documentary-maker has secretly filmed John's self-flagellation from a distance, and when released, the documentary causes an international sensation. Helicopters arrive with more journalists. Crowds of people descend on John's retreat, demanding that he perform his whipping ritual for them. From one helicopter a young woman emerges who is implied to be Lenina. John, at the sight of a woman he both adores and loathes, whips at her in a fury and then turns the whip on himself, exciting the crowd, whose wild behaviour transforms into a soma-fuelledorgy. The next morning, John awakes on the ground and is consumed by remorse over his participation in the orgy.That evening, a swarm of helicopters appear on the horizon, with the story of last night's orgy having been in all the newspapers. The first onlookers and reporters to arrive find that John is dead, havinghanged himself.Characters[edit]Bernard Marx, a sleep-learning specialist at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Although Bernard is an Alpha-Plus (the upper class of the society), he is a misfit. He is unusually short for an Alpha; an alleged accident with alcohol in Bernard's blood-surrogate before his decanting has left him slightly stunted. Unlike his fellow utopians, Bernard is often angry, resentful, and jealous. At times, he is also cowardly and hypocritical. His conditioning is clearly incomplete. He does not enjoy communal sports, solidarity services, or promiscuous sex. He does not particularly enjoy soma. Bernard is in love with Lenina and does not like her sleeping with other men, even though ""everyone belongs to everyone else"". Bernard's triumphant return to utopian civilisation with John the Savage from the Reservation precipitates the downfall of the Director, who had been planning to exile him. Bernard's triumph is short-lived; he is ultimately banished to an island for his non-conformist behaviour.John, the illicit son of the Director and Linda, born and reared on the Savage Reservation (""Malpais"") after Linda was unwittingly left behind by her errant lover. John (""the Savage"" or ""Mr Savage"", as he is often called) is an outsider both on the Reservation—where the natives still practise marriage, natural birth, family life and religion—and the ostensibly civilised World State, based on principles of stability and happiness. He has read nothing but the complete works ofWilliam Shakespeare, which he quotes extensively, and, for the most part, aptly, though his allusion to the ""Brave New World"" (Miranda's words inThe Tempest) takes on a darker and bitterly ironic resonance as the novel unfolds. John is intensely moral according to a code that he has been taught by Shakespeare and life in Malpais but is also naïve: his views are as imported into his own consciousness as are thehypnopedicmessages of World State citizens. The admonishments of the men of Malpais taught him to regard his mother as a whore; but he cannot grasp that these were the same men who continually sought her out despite their supposedly sacred pledges of monogamy. Because he is unwanted in Malpais, he accepts the invitation to travel back to London and is initially astonished by the comforts of the World State. He remains committed to values that exist only in his poetry. He first spurns Lenina for failing to live up to his Shakespearean ideal and then the entire utopian society: he asserts that its technological wonders and consumerism are poor substitutes for individual freedom, human dignity and personal integrity. After his mother's death, he becomes deeply distressed with grief, surprising onlookers in the hospital. He then withdraws himself from society and attempts to purify himself of ""sin"" (desire), but is unable to do so. His unusual behaviour eventually attracts the attention of reporters and, later, huge amounts of people, who arrive in helicopters and make John furious with their behaviour. Excited by his fury, people start an orgy, which he cannot resist joining. After waking up the next morning, John is horrified by his actions and hangs himself.Helmholtz Watson, a handsome and successful Alpha-Plus lecturer at the College of Emotional Engineering and a friend of Bernard. He feels unfulfilled writing endless propaganda doggerel, and the stifling conformism andphilistinismof the World State make him restive. Helmholtz is ultimately exiled to theFalkland Islands—a cold asylum for disaffected Alpha-Plus non-conformists—after reading a heretical poem to his students on the virtues of solitude and helping John destroy some Deltas' rations of soma following Linda's death. Unlike Bernard, he takes his exile in his stride and comes to view it as an opportunity for inspiration in his writing. His first name derives from the German physicistHermann von Helmholtz.Lenina Crowne, a young, beautiful foetus technician at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Lenina Crowne is a Beta who enjoys being a Beta. She is a vaccination worker with beliefs and values that are in line with a citizen of the World State. She is part of the 30% of the female population that are not freemartins (sterile women). Lenina is promiscuous and popular but somewhat quirky in her society: she had a four-month relation with Henry Foster, choosing not to have sex with anyone but him for a period of time. She is basically happy and well-conditioned, using soma to suppress unwelcome emotions, as is expected. Lenina has a date with Bernard, to whom she feels ambivalently attracted, and she goes to the Reservation with him. On returning to civilisation, she tries and fails to seduce John the Savage. John loves and desires Lenina but he is repelled by her forwardness and the prospect of pre-marital sex, rejecting her as an ""impudent strumpet"". Lenina visits John at the lighthouse but he attacks her with a whip, unwittingly inciting onlookers to do the same. Her exact fate is left unspecified.Mustapha Mond, Resident World Controller of Western Europe, ""His Fordship"" Mustapha Mond presides over one of the ten zones of the World State, the global government set up after the cataclysmic Nine Years' War and great Economic Collapse. Sophisticated and good-natured, Mond is an urbane and hyperintelligent advocate of the World State and its ethos of ""Community, Identity, Stability"". Among the novel's characters, he is uniquely aware of the precise nature of the society he oversees and what it has given up to accomplish its gains. Mond argues that art, literature, and scientific freedom must be sacrificed to secure the ultimateutilitariangoal of maximising societal happiness. He defends the caste system, behavioural conditioning, and the lack of personal freedom in the World State: these, he says, are a price worth paying for achieving social stability, the highest social virtue because it leads to lasting happiness.Fanny Crowne, Lenina Crowne's friend (they have the same last name because only ten thousand last names are in use in a World State comprising two billion people). Fanny voices the conventional values of her caste and society, particularly the importance of promiscuity: she advises Lenina that she should have more than one man in her life because it is unseemly to concentrate on just one. Fanny then warns Lenina away from a new lover whom she considers undeserving, yet she is ultimately supportive of the young woman's attraction to the savage John.Henry Foster, one of Lenina's many lovers, is a perfectly conventional Alpha male, casually discussing Lenina's body with his coworkers. His success with Lenina, and his casual attitude about it, infuriate the jealous Bernard. Henry ultimately proves himself every bit the ideal World State citizen, finding no courage to defend Lenina from John's assaults despite having maintained an uncommonly longstanding sexual relationship with her.Benito Hoover, another of Lenina's lovers. She remembers that he is particularly hairy when he takes his clothes off.TheDirector of Hatcheries and Conditioning (DHC), also known asThomas ""Tomakin"", is the administrator of the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where he is a threatening figure who intends to exile Bernard to Iceland. His plans take an unexpected turn when Bernard returns from the Reservation with Linda (see below) and John, a child they both realise is actually his. This fact, scandalous and obscene in the World State, not because it was extramarital (which all sexual acts are), but because it was procreative, leads the Director to resign his post in shame.Linda, John's mother, decanted as a Beta-Minus in the World State, originally worked in the DHC's Fertilizing Room, and subsequently lost during a storm while visiting the New Mexico Savage Reservation with the Director many years before the events of the novel. Despite following her usual precautions, Linda became pregnant with the Director's son during their time together and was therefore unable to return to the World State by the time that she found her way to Malpais. Having been conditioned to the promiscuous social norms of the World State, Linda finds herself at once popular with every man in the pueblo (because she is open to all sexual advances) and also reviled for the same reason, seen as a whore by the wives of the men who visit her and by the men themselves (who come to her nonetheless). Her only comforts there aremescalbrought by Popé as well aspeyotl. Linda is desperate to return to the World State and to soma, wanting nothing more from her remaining life than comfort until death.TheArch-Community-Songster, the secular equivalent of theArchbishop of Canterburyin the World State society. He takes personal offense when John refuses to attend Bernard's party.TheDirector of Crematoria and Phosphorus Reclamation, one of the many disappointed, important figures to attend Bernard's party.TheWarden, an Alpha-Minus, the talkative chief administrator for the New Mexico Savage Reservation. He is blond, short, broad-shouldered, and has a booming voice.[27]Darwin Bonaparte, a ""big game photographer"" (i.e., filmmaker) who films John flogging himself. Darwin Bonaparte became known for two works: ""feely of the gorillas' wedding"",[28]and ""Sperm Whale's Love-life"".[28]He had already made a name for himself[29]but still seeks more. He renews his fame by filming the savage, John, in his newest release ""The Savage of Surrey"".[30]His name alludes toCharles DarwinandNapoleon Bonaparte.Dr. Shaw, Bernard Marx's physician who consequently becomes the physician of both Linda and John. He prescribes a lethal dose of soma to Linda, which will stop her respiratory system from functioning in a span of one to two months, at her own behest but not without protest from John. Ultimately, they all agree that it is for the best, since denying her this request would cause more trouble for Society and Linda herself.Dr. Gaffney,Provostof Eton, an Upper School for high-caste individuals. He shows Bernard and John around the classrooms, and the Hypnopaedic Control Room (used for behavioural conditioning through sleep learning). John asks if the students read Shakespeare but the Provost says the library contains only reference books because solitary activities, such as reading, are discouraged.Miss Keate,Head MistressofEtonUpper School. Bernard fancies her, and arranges an assignation with her.[31]Others[edit]Freemartins, women who have been deliberately made sterile by exposure to male hormones during foetal development but are still physically normal except for ""the slightest tendency to grow beards"". In the book, government policy requires freemartins to form 70% of the female population.Of Malpais[edit]Popé, a native of Malpais. Although he reinforces the behaviour that causes hatred for Linda in Malpais by sleeping with her and bringing hermescal, he still holds the traditional beliefs of his tribe. In his early years John attempted to kill him, but Popé brushed off his attempt and sent him fleeing. He gave Linda a copy of the Complete Works of Shakespeare. (Historically,Popéor Po'pay was aTewareligious leader who led thePueblo Revoltin 1680 againstSpanishcolonial rule.)Mitsima, an elder tribalshamanwho also teaches John survival skills such as rudimentary ceramics (specificallycoil pots, which were traditional to Native American tribes) and bow-making.Kiakimé, a native girl whom John fell for, but is instead eventually wed to another boy from Malpais.Kothlu, a native boy with whom Kiakimé is wed.Background figures[edit]These are non-fictional and factual characters who lived before the events in this book, but are of note in the novel:Henry Ford, who has become amessianicfigure to theWorld State. ""Our Ford"" is used in place of ""Our Lord"", as a credit to popularising the use of theassembly line.Sigmund Freud, ""Our Freud"" is sometimes said in place of ""Our Ford"" because Freud's psychoanalytic method depends implicitly upon the rules of classical conditioning,[citation needed]and because Freud popularised the idea that sexual activity is essential to human happiness. (It is also strongly implied that citizens of the World State believe Freud and Ford to be the same person.)[32]H. G. Wells, ""Dr. Wells"", British writer andutopian socialist, whose bookMen Like Godswas a motivation forBrave New World. ""All's well that ends Wells"", wrote Huxley in his letters, criticising Wells for anthropological assumptions Huxley found unrealistic.Ivan Pavlov, whose conditioning techniques are used to train infants.William Shakespeare, whose banned works are quoted throughout the novel by John, ""the Savage"". The plays quoted includeMacbeth,The Tempest,Romeo and Juliet,Hamlet,King Lear,Troilus and Cressida,Measure for MeasureandOthello. Mustapha Mond also knows them because as a World Controller he has access to a selection of books from throughout history, including theBible.Thomas Robert Malthus, 19th century British economist, believed the people of the Earth would eventually be threatened by their inability to raise enough food to feed the population. In the novel, the eponymous character devises the contraceptive techniques (Malthusian belt) that are practiced by women of the World State.Reuben Rabinovitch, the Polish-Jew character on whom the effects of sleep-learning,hypnopædia, are first observed.John Henry Newman, 19th century Catholic theologian and educator, believed university education the critical element in advancing post-industrial Western civilization. Mustapha Mond and The Savage discuss a passage from one of Newman's books.Alfred Mond, British industrialist, financier and politician. He is the namesake of Mustapha Mond.[33]Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first President ofRepublic of Turkey. Naming Mond after Atatürk links up with their characteristics; he reigned during the timeBrave New Worldwas written and revolutionised the 'old' Ottoman state into a new nation.[33]Sources of names and references[edit]The limited number of names that the World State assigned to its bottle-grown citizens can be traced to political and cultural figures who contributed to the bureaucratic, economic, and technological systems of Huxley's age, and presumably those systems inBrave New World.[34]Soma: Huxley took the name for the drug used by the state to control the population after the Vedic ritual drinkSoma, inspired by his interest in Indianmysticism.Malthusian belt: A contraceptive device worn by women. When Huxley was writingBrave New World, organizations such as theMalthusian Leaguehad spread throughout Europe, advocating contraception. Although the controversial economic theory ofMalthusianismwas derived froman essaybyThomas Malthusabout the economic effects of population growth, Malthus himself was an advocate of abstinence rather than contraception.Bokanovsky's Process: A scientific process used in the World State to mass-produce human beings. Specifically, the ""Bokanovsky Process"" is a method of producing multiple embryos from a single fertilized egg, creating up to 96 identical individuals. This technique is central to the society's efforts to maintain social stability and control, as it allows for the creation of a standardized, docile workforce. It's part of the larger theme in the novel of dehumanization and the reduction of individuality in the pursuit of a controlled, stable society. It is thought that the process's name is a reference toMaurice Bokanowski, a French Bureaucrat who believed strongly in the idea of governmental and social efficiency. Complementing this, Podsnap's Technique accelerates the maturation of human eggs, enabling the rapid production of thousands of nearly identical individuals. Together, these methods facilitate the creation of a large, standardized population, eliminating natural reproduction and traditional family structures, thereby reinforcing the World State's control over its citizens.Reception[edit]Upon its publication,Rebecca WestpraisedBrave New Worldas ""The most accomplished novel Huxley has yet written"",[35]Joseph Needhamlauded it as ""Mr Huxley's remarkable book"",[36]andBertrand Russellalso praised it, stating, ""Mr Aldous Huxley has shown his usual masterly skill inBrave New World.""[37]Brave New Worldalso received negative responses from other contemporary critics, although his work was later embraced.[38]In an article in the 4 May 1935 issue of theIllustrated London News,G. K. Chestertonexplained that Huxley was revolting against the ""Age of Utopias"". Much of the discourse on man's future before 1914 was based on the thesis that humanity would solve all economic and social issues. In the decade following the war the discourse shifted to an examination of the causes of the catastrophe. The works ofH. G. WellsandGeorge Bernard Shawon the promises of socialism and a World State were then viewed as the ideas of naive optimists. Chesterton wrote:After the Age of Utopias came what we may call the American Age, lasting as long as the Boom. Men like Ford or Mond seemed to many to have solved the social riddle and made capitalism the common good. But it was not native to us; it went with a buoyant, not to say blatant optimism, which is not our negligent or negative optimism. Much more than Victorian righteousness, or even Victorian self-righteousness, that optimism has driven people into pessimism. For the Slump brought even more disillusionment than the War. A new bitterness, and a new bewilderment, ran through all social life, and was reflected in all literature and art. It was contemptuous, not only of the old Capitalism, but of the old Socialism.Brave New Worldis more of a revolution against Utopia than against Victoria.[39]Similarly, in 1944 economistLudwig von MisesdescribedBrave New Worldas asatireof utopian predictions ofsocialism: ""Aldous Huxley was even courageous enough to make socialism's dreamed paradise the target of his sardonic irony.""[40]Common misunderstandings[edit]Part of a series onHuman enhancementAdvocacyRationaleAdaptionist""Beneficient""EmancipatoryCompensatoryDemocratic""Directive""Libertarian""Metahumanistic""Posthumanistic""Prometheist""PreventativeTranshumanisticParadigmBiohappinessCyborgsEugenicsIntelligence amplificationMoral enhancementProstheses(De facto)germline interventionsSelectiveCloningCounselingGeneticGenomicPre-conceptionGenetic enhancementGenetic engineeringEpigenome editingPGDEmbryo qualityOocyte selectionPolygenic (risk) score(technical article)Prenatal testingSelectiveabortionSex selectionSperm sorting""Nobelist sperm banks""Somatic interventionsBody hackingSomatic gene therapyfor color blindnessin sports dopingStem-cell therapyEmbryonic cellsFetal tissue implantChemicalStimulantsAmphetamineMethamphetamineRitalinNootropicsModafinilPiracetamXanthine derivativesCaffeineNeurologicalBrain implantBrain–computer interfaceDeep brain stimulation""Man-Computer Symbiosis""(1960)NeuralinkNeurohackingOppositionAppeal to natureBioconservatism""Brave New WorldArgument""ChestertonFrancis FukuyamaOur Posthuman Future(2002)Cloning prohibitionLeon KassStem cell controversy""Designer baby""""Frankenstein's monster""He Jiankui genome editing incidentHwang affairAgainst life extensionUndesirability of immortalityNikolas KompridisLegalEU convention on BioethicsStem Cell Research Enhancement Act(vetoed)United Nations Declaration on Human CloningIn the UK1990 act2003 act2008 act2001 actC.

Although Huxley wrote that ""eugenicsanddysgenicswere practiced systematically"", this seems to refer only to selective breeding and not to any kind of direct manipulation on the genetic level. (The Bokanovsky process does represent a form of cloning, but this is not ethically equivalent to germline genome editing, and references toBrave New Worldmay lead some readers to confuse the two technologies.) [...] While it's true that the upper castes inBrave New Worldare smarter than the others, this is more because of the deliberate impairment of the lower castes than because the upper castes are ""perfect"". Rather than reducing the number of individuals born with genetic disorders or handicaps, Huxley's dystopia involves dramatically increasing their number. [...] Quite the opposite: Huxley thought thatBrave New Worldmight come about if wedidn'tstart selecting better children.[45]: 318-9Overall, Derek So notes that ""Huxley was much more worried about totalitarianism than about the new biotechnologies per se that he alluded to in Brave New World.""[45][46]Despite claims to the contrary then, Huxley remained a committed eugenicist all throughout his life,[47]much like his comparably famous brotherJulian, and one just as keen on stressing itshumanistic underpinnings.[48]The World State and Fordism[edit]The World State is built upon the principles of Henry Ford'sassembly line: mass production, homogeneity, predictability, and consumption of disposable consumer goods. While the World State lacks any supernatural-based religions, Ford himself is revered as the creator of their society but not as a deity, and characters celebrate Ford Day and swear oaths by his name (e.g., ""By Ford!""). In this sense, some fragments of traditional religion are present, such as Christian crosses, which had their tops cut off to be changed to a ""T"", representing theFord Model T. In England, there is an Arch-Community-Songster of Canterbury, obviously continuing theArchbishop of Canterbury, and in AmericaThe Christian Science Monitorcontinues publication asThe Fordian Science Monitor. The World State calendar numbers years in the ""AF"" era—""After Ford""—with the calendar beginning in AD 1908, the year in which Ford's first Model T rolled off his assembly line. The novel's Gregorian calendar year is AD 2540, but it is referred to in the book as AF 632.[49]From birth, members of every class areindoctrinatedby recorded voices repeating slogans while they sleep (called ""hypnopædia"" in the book) to believe that membership of their own class is preferable, but that the other classes perform needed functions. Any residual unhappiness is resolved by anantidepressantandhallucinogenic drugcalled soma.The biological techniques used to control the populace inBrave New Worlddo not includegenetic engineering; Huxley wrote the book before the structure ofDNAwas known. However,Gregor Mendel's work with inheritance patterns in peas had been rediscovered in 1900 and theeugenicsmovement, based onartificial selection, was well established.Huxley's familyincluded a number of prominent biologists includingThomas Huxley, half-brother andNobel LaureateAndrew Huxley, and his brotherJulian Huxleywho was a biologist and involved in the eugenics movement. Nonetheless, Huxley emphasises conditioning over breeding (nurture versus nature); human embryos and fetuses are conditioned through a carefully designed regimen of chemical (such as exposure to hormones and toxins), thermal (exposure to intense heat or cold, as one's future career would dictate), and other environmental stimuli, although there is an element ofselective breedingas well.Comparisons with George Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four[edit]Further information:Nineteen Eighty-Four § Brave New World comparisonsIn a letter toGeorge OrwellaboutNineteen Eighty-Four, Huxley wrote ""Whether in actual fact the policy of the boot-on-the-face can go on indefinitely seems doubtful. My own belief is that the ruling oligarchy will find less arduous and wasteful ways of governing and of satisfying its lust for power, and these ways will resemble those which I described in Brave New World.""[50]He went on to write ""Within the next generation I believe that the world's rulers will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging and kicking them into obedience.""[50]Social criticNeil Postmancontrasted the worlds ofNineteen Eighty-FourandBrave New Worldin the foreword of his 1985 bookAmusing Ourselves to Death. He writes:What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of thefeelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked inBrave New World Revisited, the civillibertariansand rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny ""failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions."" In1984, Huxley added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. InBrave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we hate will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we love will ruin us.The writerChristopher Hitchens, who published several articles on Huxley and a book on Orwell, noted the difference between the two texts in the introduction to his 1999 article ""Why Americans Are Not Taught History"",We dwell in a present-tense culture that somehow, significantly, decided to employ the telling expression ""You're history"" as a choice reprobation or insult, and thus elected to speak forgotten volumes about itself. By that standard, the forbidding dystopia of George Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Fouralready belongs, both as a text and as a date, withUrandMycenae, while thehedonistnihilismof Huxley still beckons toward a painless, amusement-sodden, and stress-free consensus. Orwell's was a house of horrors. He seemed to strain credulity because he posited a regime that would go to any lengths to own and possess history, to rewrite and construct it, and to inculcate it by means of coercion. Whereas Huxley ... rightly foresaw that any such regime could break because it could not bend. In 1988, four years after 1984, theSoviet Unionscrapped its official history curriculum and announced that a newly authorized version was somewhere in the works. This was the precise moment when the regime conceded its own extinction. For true blissed-out and vacant servitude, though, you need an otherwise sophisticated society where no serious history is taught.[51]Brave New World Revisited[edit]In 1946, Huxley wrote in the foreword of the new edition ofBrave New World:If I were now to rewrite the book, I would offerthe Savagea third alternative. Between the Utopian and primitive horns of his dilemma would lie the possibility of sanity... In this community economics would be decentralist andHenry-Georgian, politicsKropotkinesqueand co-operative. Science and technology would be used as though, like theSabbath, they had been made for man, not (as at present and still more so in the Brave New World) as though man were to be adapted and enslaved to them. Religion would be the conscious and intelligent pursuit of man's Final End, the unitive knowledge of immanentTaoorLogos, the transcendentGodheadorBrahman. And the prevailing philosophy of life would be a kind of HigherUtilitarianism, in which the Greatest Happiness principle would be secondary to the Final End principle—the first question to be asked and answered in every contingency of life being: ""How will this thought or action contribute to, or interfere with, the achievement, by me and the greatest possible number of other individuals, of man's Final End?""[52]First UK editionBrave New World Revisited(Harper & Brothers, US, 1958;Chatto & Windus, UK, 1959),[53]written by Huxley almost thirty years afterBrave New World, is a non-fiction work in which Huxley considered whether the world had moved toward or away from his vision of the future from the 1930s. He believed when he wrote the original novel that it was a reasonable guess as to where the world might go in the future. InBrave New World Revisited, he concluded that the world was becoming likeBrave New Worldmuch faster than he originally thought.Huxley analysed the causes of this, such asoverpopulation, as well as all the means by which populations can be controlled. He was particularly interested in the effects ofdrugsandsubliminal suggestion.Brave New World Revisitedis different in tone because of Huxley's evolving thought, as well as his conversion to HinduVedantain the interim between the two books.The last chapter of the book aims to propose action which could be taken to prevent a democracy from turning into thetotalitarianworld described inBrave New World. In Huxley's last novel,Island, he again expounds similar ideas to describe a utopian nation, which is generally viewed as a counterpart toBrave New World.[54]Censorship[edit]According toAmerican Library Association,Brave New Worldhas frequently been banned and challenged in the United States due to insensitivity, offensive language, nudity, racism, drug use, conflict with a religious viewpoint, and being sexually explicit.[55]It landed on the list of the top tenmost challenged booksin 2010 (3) and 2011 (7).[55]The book also secured a spot on the association's list of the top one hundred challenged books for 1990–1999 (54),[7]2000–2009 (36),[8]and 2010–2019 (26).[9]The following include specific instances of when the book has been censored, banned, or challenged:In 1932, the book wasbanned in Irelandfor its language, and for supposedly being anti-family and anti-religion.[56][57]In 1965, aMarylandEnglish teacher alleged that he was fired for assigningBrave New Worldto students. The teacher sued for violation ofFirst Amendmentrights but lost both his case and theappeal, with the appeals court ruling that the assignment of the book was not the reason for his firing.[58]The book was banned in India in 1967, with Huxley accused of being a ""pornographer"".[59]In 1980, it was removed from classrooms inMiller, Missouri, among other challenges.[60]The version ofBrave New World Revisitedpublished in China lacks explicit mentions of China itself.[61]Influences and allegations of plagiarism[edit]The English writerRose MacaulaypublishedWhat Not: A Prophetic Comedyin 1918.What Notdepicts a dystopian future where people are ranked by intelligence, the government mandates mind training for all citizens, and procreation is regulated by the state.[62]Macaulay and Huxley shared the same literary circles and he attended her weekly literary salons.Bertrand RussellfeltBrave New Worldborrowed from his 1931 bookThe Scientific Outlook, and wrote in a letter to his publisher that Huxley's novel was ""merely an expansion of the two penultimate chapters of 'The Scientific Outlook.'""[63]H. G. Wells' novelThe First Men in the Moon(1901) used concepts that Huxley added to his story. Both novels introduce a society (in Wells' case, that of the Lunar natives) consisting of a specialized caste system, in which new generations are produced in vessels, where their designated caste is decided before birth by tampering with the fetus' development, and individuals are drugged down when they are not needed.[64]George Orwellbelieved thatBrave New Worldmust have been partly derived from the 1921 novelWeby Russian authorYevgeny Zamyatin.[65]However, in a 1962 letter to Christopher Collins, Huxley says that he wroteBrave New Worldlong before he had heard ofWe.[66]According toWetranslator Natasha Randall, Orwell believed that Huxley was lying.[67]Kurt Vonnegutsaid that in writingPlayer Piano(1952), he ""cheerfully ripped off the plot ofBrave New World, whose plot had been cheerfully ripped off from Yevgeny Zamyatin'sWe"".[68]In 1982,Polishauthor Antoni Smuszkiewicz, in his analysis of Polish science-fictionZaczarowana gra(""The Magic Game""), presented accusations ofplagiarismagainst Huxley. Smuszkiewicz showed similarities betweenBrave New Worldand two science fiction novels written earlier by Polish authorMieczysław Smolarski, namelyMiasto światłości(""The City of Light"", 1924) andPodróż poślubna pana Hamiltona(""Mr Hamilton's Honeymoon Trip"", 1928).[69]Smuszkiewicz wrote in his open letter to Huxley: ""This work of a great author, both in the general depiction of the world as well as countless details, is so similar to two of my novels that in my opinion there is no possibility of accidental analogy.""[70]Kate Lohnes, writing forEncyclopædia Britannica, notes similarities betweenBrave New Worldand other novels of the era could be seen as expressing ""common fears surrounding the rapid advancement of technology and of the shared feelings of many tech-skeptics during the early 20th century"". Other dystopian novels followed Huxley's work, includingC.S. Lewis'sThat Hideous Strength(1945) and Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Four(1949).[71]Legacy[edit]In 1998–1999, the Modern Library rankedBrave New Worldfifth on its list of the 100 Best Novels in English of the 20th century.[4]In 2003,Robert McCrumwriting forThe ObserverincludedBrave New Worldchronologically at number 53 in ""the top 100 greatest novels of all time"",[5]and the novel was listed at number 87 on theBBC's surveyThe Big Read.[6]On 5 November 2019,BBC NewslistedBrave New Worldon its list of the100 Most Inspiring Novels.[72]In 2021,Brave New Worldwas one of six classic science fiction novels by British authors selected byRoyal Mailto feature on aseries of UK postage stamps.[73]Adaptations[edit]Theatre[edit]Brave New World(opened 4 September 2015) in co-production by Royal & Derngate, Northampton and Touring Consortium Theatre Company which toured the UK.

However, by the end of the novella, the rebellion is betrayed, and under thedictatorshipof a pig namedNapoleon, the farm ends up in a far worse state than it was before.[5]According to Orwell,Animal Farmreflects events leading up to theRussian Revolutionof 1917 and then on into theStalinist eraof theSoviet Union, a period when Russia lived under theMarxist–Leninistideology ofJoseph Stalin.[2][6]Orwell, ademocratic socialist,[7]was a critic of Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directedStalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the BarcelonaMay Daysconflicts between thePOUMand Stalinist forces, during theSpanish Civil War.[8][a]In a letter to Yvonne Davet (a french writer), Orwell describedAnimal Farmas a satirical tale against Stalin (""un conte satirique contre Staline""),[9]and in his essay, ""Why I Write"" (1946), wrote: ""Animal Farmwas the first book in which I tried, with full consciousness of what I was doing, to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole"".[10]The original title of the novel wasAnimal Farm: A Fairy Story.[1]American publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations, during Orwell's lifetime, theTeluguversion, kept it. Other title variations include subtitles like ""A Satire"" and ""A Contemporary Satire"".[9]Orwell suggested the titleUnion des républiques socialistes animalesfor the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, theLatinword for ""bear"", asymbol of Russia. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union,Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques.[9]Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in itswartime alliancewith the Soviet Union againstNazi Germanyand the Britishintelligentsiaheld Stalin in high esteem, which Orwell hated.[11]The manuscript was initially rejected by several British and American publishers,[12]including one of Orwell's own,Victor Gollancz, which delayed its publication.[b]It became a great commercial success when it did appear, as international relations and public opinion were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to theCold War.[14]Timemagazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);[15]it also featured at number 31 on theModern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels,[16]and number 46 on theBBC'sThe Big Readpoll.[17]It won aRetrospective Hugo Awardin 1996,[18]and is included in theGreat Books of the Western Worldselection.[19]Plot summary[edit]The animal populace of the poorly run Manor Farm nearWillingdon, England, is ripened for rebellion by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmerMr. Jones. One night, the exalted boarOld Majorholds a conference, at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called ""Beasts of England"". When Old Major dies, two young pigs,SnowballandNapoleon, assume command and stage a revolt, driving Mr. Jones off the farm and renaming the property ""Animal Farm"". They adopt the Seven Commandments ofAnimalism, the most important of which is, ""All animals are equal"". The decree is painted (along with other rules) in large letters on one side of the barn. Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism. To commemorate the start of Animal Farm, Snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly. The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their health. Following an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Jones and his associates to retake the farm (henceforth referred to by the animals as the ""Battle of the Cowshed""), Snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building awindmill. Napoleon disputes this idea, and matters come to a head, which culminates in Napoleon's dogs chasing Snowball away and Napoleon effectively declaring himself supreme commander.Napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young porker namedSquealer, who is a skilledorator, Napoleon claims credit for the idea of building the windmill, claiming that Snowball was only trying to win animals to his side. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer persuade the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project, and begin topurgethe farm of animals accused by Napoleon of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) gradually smears Snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of Mr. Jones, even dismissing the fact that Snowball was given an award of courage, while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle. ""Beasts of England"" is replaced with ""Animal Farm"", while an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who is presumably adopting the lifestyle of a man (""ComradeNapoleon""), is composed and sung. Napoleon then conducts a second purge, during which many animals who are alleged to be helping Snowball in plots are executed by Napoleon's dogs, which troubles the rest of the animals. Despite their hardships, the animals are easily pacified by Napoleon's retort that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones, as well as by the sheep's continual bleating of ""four legs good, two legs bad"". As Napoleon and Squealer's increasingly humanlike behavior repeatedly contradicts the Seven Commandments, they secretly rewrite the laws to avoid facing charges.Mr. Frederick, a neighbouring farmer, attacks the farm, usingblasting powderto blow up the restored windmill. Although the animals win the battle, they do soat great cost, as many, includingBoxer the workhorse, are wounded. Although he recovers from this, Boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill (being extremely old at that time). He is taken away in aknacker's van and a donkey calledBenjaminalerts the animals of this, but Squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. Squealer subsequently reports Boxer's death and honours him with a festival the following day. While, in truth, Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buywhiskyfor themselves, which they used to celebrate following night.Years pass, the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is constructed, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals that Snowball discussed—including stalls with electric lighting, heating, and running water, along with a three-day work week for all animals—are forgotten, with Napoleon now advocating that the happiest animals livesimple lives. Snowball has been forgotten, alongside Boxer, with ""the exception of the few who knew him"". Many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old. Mr. Jones is also now known to be dead, having ""died in aninebriates' home in another part of the country"". The pigs start to resemble humans, for example by walking on ""two legs"", carrying whips, drinking alcohol, and wearing clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to just one phrase: ""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others"". The maxim ""Four legs good, two legs bad"" is similarly changed to ""Four legs good, two legs better"". Other changes include the Hoof and Horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner and Old Major's skull, which was previously put on display, being reburied.Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. The other farm animals, who have not been invited, gather toward the window to watch. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name ""The Manor Farm"". The men and pigs start playing cards, flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game. Both Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington, one of the farmers, play theace of spadesat the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first. When the animals outside look at the pigs and men, they find it is ""impossible to say which was which"".Characters[edit]Pigs[edit]Old Major– An aged prizeMiddle White boarprovides the inspiration that fuels the rebellion. He is also called Willingdon Beauty whenshowing. He is anallegoricalcombination ofKarl Marx, one of the creators of communism, andVladimir Lenin, the communist leader of theRussian Revolutionand the early Soviet nation, in that he draws up the principles of the revolution. His skull being put on revered public display recalls Lenin, whoseembalmed body was left in indefinite repose.[20]By the end of the book, the skull is reburied.Napoleon– ""A large, rather fierce-lookingBerkshireboar, the only Berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way"".[21]An allegory ofJoseph Stalin,[20]Napoleon is the leader of Animal Farm.Snowball– Napoleon's rival and original head of the farm after Jones's overthrow. His life parallels that ofLeon Trotsky,[20]although there is no reference to Snowball having been murdered (as Trotsky was); however, he was exiled from the farm and subsequently became an image of evil. He may also combine some elements from Lenin.[22][c]Squealer– A small, white, fatlarge whitewho serves as Napoleon's second-in-command and minister of propaganda, is a collective portrait of the Sovietnomenklaturaand journalists, such as of the national dailyPravda(The Truth), able to justify every twist and turn in Stalin's policy.[20]Minimus – A poetic pig who writes the second national anthem of Animal Farm after the singing of ""Beasts of England"" is banned; later he composes a poem ""Comrade Napoleon"". Literary theorist John Rodden compares him to the poetVladimir Mayakovsky,[23]whoeulogizedLenin and the Soviet Union, although Mayakovsky neither wrote anthems nor praised Stalin in his poems.The piglets – Hinted to be the children of Napoleon and are the first generation of animals subjugated to his idea of animal inequality.The young pigs – Four pigs who complain about Napoleon's takeover of the farm but are quickly silenced and later executed, the first kind of animals killed in Napoleon's farm purge. Probably based on theGreat PurgeofGrigory Zinoviev,Lev Kamenev,Nikolai Bukharin, andAlexei Rykov.Pinkeye – A minor pig who is mentioned only once; he is the taste-tester that samples Napoleon's food to make sure it is not ""poisoned"", in response to rumours about an assassination attempt on Napoleon.Humans[edit]Mr. Jones– A heavy drinker who is the original owner of Manor Farm, a farm in disrepair with farmhands who often loaf on the job. He is an allegory of RussianTsar Nicholas II,[24]who was forced to abdicate following theFebruary Revolutionof 1917 and was executed, along with the rest of his family, by theBolshevikson 17 July 1918. The animals revolt after Jones goes on a drinking binge, returns hungover the following day and neglects them completely. Jones is married, but his wife plays no active role in the book. She seems to live with her husband's drunkenness, going to bed while he stays up drinking until late into the night. In her only other appearance, she hastily throws a few things into a travel bag and flees when she sees that the animals are revolting. Towards the end of the book, Napoleon's ""favourite sow"" wears her old Sunday dress.Mr. Frederick – The tough owner of Pinchfield Farm, a small but well-kept neighbouring farm, who briefly allies with Napoleon.[25][26][27][28]Animal Farm shares land boundaries with Pinchfield on one side and Foxwood on another, making Animal Farm a ""buffer zone"" between the two bickering farmers. The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself withcockfighting. Napoleon allies with Frederick to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and destroying the windmill. The brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to theMolotov–Ribbentrop PactandOperation Barbarossa.[27][29][30]Mr. Pilkington – The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood Farm, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. Pilkington is wealthier than Frederick and owns more land, but his farm needs care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones and is worried that this could also happen to him.Mr. Whymper – A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first, he acquires necessities that cannot be produced on the farm, such as dog biscuits andparaffin wax, but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.Equines[edit]Boxer– A loyal, kind, dedicated, powerful, hard-working, and respectable cart-shire horse, although quite naive and gullible.[31]Boxer does a large share of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to believe that ""Napoleon is always right."" At one point, he questions Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, causing him to be attacked by Napoleon's dogs, however Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared toAlexey Stakhanov, a diligent and enthusiastic role model of theStakhanovite movement.[32]He has been described as ""faithful and strong"";[33]he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.[34]When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a localknackerto buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account, falsifying the circumstances of Boxer's death.Mollie – A self-centred, self-indulgent, and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution, like those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar.[35]She is only once mentioned again, and has an affinity for hair ribbons and sugar cubes.Clover – A gentle, caring mare, who shows concern, especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can read all the letters of the alphabet, but cannot ""put words together"".Benjamin– A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly. He is sceptical, temperamental and cynical: his most frequent remark is, ""Life will go on as it has always gone on – that is, badly"". AcademicMorris Dicksteinhas suggested there is ""a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless scepticism""[36]and indeed, friends called Orwell ""Donkey George"", ""after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, inAnimal Farm"".[37]Benjamin manages to evade the purges and survive despite the threat he potentially poses given his knowledge, his age, and his equivocal, albeit apolitical, positions.Other animals[edit]Muriel – A goat who is another of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm and friends with all of the animals on the farm. Similar to Benjamin, Muriel is one of the few animals on the farm who is not a pig but can read. She survives, as does Benjamin, by eschewing politics.The puppies – Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, the puppies were taken away at birth by Napoleon and raised by him to serve as his powerful security force.Moses – The Raven, ""Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker"".[38]Initially following Mrs. Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called ""Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!"" Orwell portraysestablished religionas ""the black raven of priestcraft – promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power"". His preaching to the animals heartens them, and Napoleon allows Moses to reside at the farm ""with an allowance of a gill of beer daily"", akin to how Stalin brought back theRussian Orthodox Churchduring the Second World War.[36]The sheep – They are not given individual names or personalities. They show limited understanding of Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm, yet nonetheless, they are the voice ofblind conformity[36]as they bleat their support of Napoleon's ideals with jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Their constant bleating of ""four legs good, two legs bad"" was used as a device to drown out any opposition or alternative views from Snowball, much as Stalin used hysterical crowds to drown out Trotsky.[39]Towards the end of the book, Squealer (thepropagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to ""four legs good, two legs better"", which they dutifully do.The hens – The hens are promised following the rebellion that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr. Jones, however, their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside the farm. The hens are among the first to rebel, albeit unsuccessfully, against Napoleon, being brutally suppressed through starvation. They represent the Ukrainian victims of theHolodomor.[40][41]The cows – Unnamed. The cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen but can be used to raise their calves. Their milk is then stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries.The cat – Unnamed and never seen to carry out any work. The cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven because her excuses are so convincing and she ""purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions"".[42]She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually ""voted on both sides"".[43]The ducks – Unnamed. A brood of ducklings is said to have lost their mother. They are protected by Clover.The roosters – One arranges to wake Boxer early, and a black one acts as a trumpeter for Napoleon since he was a young cockerel.The geese – Unnamed. One gander commits suicide by eating nightshade berries.The pigeons — Unnamed. They attend Major’s speech, report the appearance of Mollie on another farm, and partake in the Battle of the Cowshed, and are later used to convey messages between the pigs and humans under Napoleon’s watch.The rats – Unnamed. Classed among the wild animals, unsuccessful attempts were made to civilise them and teach them the principles of Animalism.The rabbits – Like the rats unsuccessful attempts were made to civilise them. At one point, Jones' men go rabbiting.Genre and style[edit]George Orwell'sAnimal Farmis an example of a political satire and an allegory that was intended to have a ""wider application"", according to Orwell himself, in terms of its relevance.[44]Stylistically, the work shares many similarities with some of Orwell's other works, most notablyNineteen Eighty-Four, as both have been considered works ofSwiftiansatire.[45]Furthermore, these two prominent works seem to suggest Orwell's bleak view of the future for humanity; he seems to stress the potential/current threat of dystopias similar to those inAnimal FarmandNineteen Eighty-Four.[46]In these kinds of works, Orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of Europe following the Second World War.[47]Orwell's style and writing philosophy as a whole were very concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing.[48]Orwell was committed to communicating straightforwardly, given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse. For this reason, he is careful, inAnimal Farm, to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion making the words easier to understand.[48]The difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact, as the general moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly, while the wicked animals on the farm, such as Napoleon, twist language in such a way that it meets their insidious desires. This style reflects Orwell's proximity to the issues facing Europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on Stalin's Soviet Russia.[48]Background[edit]Origin and writing[edit]Just asNineteen Eighty-Fourwould be inspired byYevgeny Zamyatin'sWe,Animal Farmalso had its influences: ""In 1937, the year in which Orwell said he first thought ofAnimal Farm, Gollancz's Left Book Club published bothThe Road to Wigan Pierand a left-wing children's book,The Adventures of the Little Pig and Other Storiesby F. Le Gros and Ida Clark.""[49]George Orwell wrote the manuscript between November 1943 and February 1944[50]after his experiences during theSpanish Civil War, which he described inHomage to Catalonia(1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition ofAnimal Farm, he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him ""how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries"".[51]This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as theStalinistcorruption of the original socialist ideals.[52]Homage to Cataloniasold poorly; after seeingArthur Koestler's best-sellingDarkness at Noonabout theMoscow Trials, Orwell decided that fiction would be the best way to describe totalitarianism.[53]Immediately before writing the book, Orwell quit theBBC. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.[54]In the preface, Orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:[52]I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.In 1944, the manuscript was almost lost when a GermanV-1 flying bombdestroyed his London home. Orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact.[55]Publication[edit]Publishing[edit]Orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused to publishAnimal Farm, yet one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting theMinistry of Information.[56][d]Eventually,Secker and Warburgpublished the first edition in 1945.DuringWorld War II, it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch – including his regular publisherGollancz. He also submitted the manuscript toFaber and Faber, where the poetT. S. Eliot(who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's ""good writing"" and ""fundamental integrity"", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint ""which I take to be generallyTrotskyite"". Eliot said he found the view ""not convincing"", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue ""what was needed ... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs"".[57]Orwell letAndré Deutsch, who was working for Nicholson & Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and ""lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors inAnimal Farm"".[58]In hisLondon Letteron 17 April 1944 forPartisan Review, Orwell wrote that it was ""now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle"".The publisherJonathan Cape, who had initially acceptedAnimal Farm, subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off[59]– although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be aSovietspy.[60]Writing toLeonard Moore, a partner in the literary agency of Christy & Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the ""important official"" was a man namedPeter Smollett, who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.[61]Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwellincluded in his listof Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to theInformation Research Departmentin 1949. The publisher wrote to Orwell, saying:[59]If the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right, but the fable does follow, as I see now, so completely the progress of the Russian Soviets and their two dictators [Lenin and Stalin], that it can apply only to Russia, to the exclusion of the other dictatorships.Another thing: it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs. I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.Frederic Warburgalso faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and theRed Army,[62]which hadplayed a major partin defeatingAdolf Hitler. A Russian translation was printed in the paperPosev, and in permitting a Russian translation ofAnimal Farm, Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.[e]In October 1945, Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonistDavid Lowmight illustrateAnimal Farm. Low had written a letter saying that he had had ""a good time withAnimal Farm– an excellent bit of satire – it would illustrate perfectly"". Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker & Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned. TheFolio Societypublished an edition in 1984 illustrated byQuentin Blakeand an edition illustrated by the cartoonistRalph Steadmanwas published by Secker & Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition ofAnimal Farm.[63][64]Preface[edit]Orwell originally wrote aprefacecomplaining about Britishself-censorshipand how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary ... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that ""it wouldn't do"" to mention that particular fact.Although the first edition allowed space for the preface in the author's proof, it was not included, and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute.[56]In 1972,Ian Angusfound the original typescript titled ""The Freedom of the Press"", andBernard Crickpublished it, together with his introduction, inThe Times Literary Supplementon 15 September 1972 as ""How the essay came to be written"".[56]Orwell's essay criticised British self-censorship by the press, specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of Stalin and the Soviet government.[56]The same essay also appeared in the Italian 1976 edition ofAnimal Farmwith another introduction by Crick, claiming to be the first edition with the preface. Other publishers were still declining to publish it.[clarification needed]Reception[edit]Contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive. Writing in the AmericanNew Republicmagazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it ""puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly"". Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real-world inspirations, and said, ""It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well"".[65]The Guardianon 24 August 1945 calledAnimal Farm""a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few"".[66]Tosco Fyvel, writing inTribuneon the same day, called the book ""a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us"".Julian Symonsresponded, on 7 September, ""Should we not expect, inTribuneat least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State – Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years perhaps,Animal Farmmay be simply a fairy story; today it is a political satire with a good deal of point"".Animal Farmhas been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.[67]Between 1952 and 1957, the CIA, in an operation codenamed Aedinosaur, sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down.[53]TheInformation Research Department, a secret Cold War propaganda agency of the British government, translated the book into various languages such as Arabic.[68]Timemagazine choseAnimal Farmas one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);[15]it also featured at number 31 on theModern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels.[16]It won aRetrospective Hugo Awardin 1996 and is included in theGreat Books of the Western Worldselection.[19]Popular reading in schools,Animal Farmwas ranked the UK's favourite book from school in a 2016 poll.[69]Animal Farmhas also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the US.[70]The following are examples of this controversy that has existed around Orwell's work:TheJohn Birch Societyin Wisconsin challenged the reading ofAnimal Farmin 1965 because of its reference to the masses revolting.[70][71]New York State English Council's Committee on Defense Against Censorship found that in 1968,Animal Farmhad been widely deemed a ""problem book"".[70]A censorship survey conducted in DeKalb County, Georgia, relating to the years 1979–1982, revealed that many schools had attempted to limit access toAnimal Farmdue to its ""political theories"".[70]A superintendent in Bay County, Florida, bannedAnimal Farmat the middle school and high school levels in 1987.[70]The Board quickly brought back the book, however, after receiving complaints of the ban as ""unconstitutional"".[70]Animal Farmwas removed from the Stonington, Connecticut school district curriculum in 2017.[72]Animal Farmhas also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries.[70]The ALA also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the International Book Fair in Moscow, Russia, in 1977 and banned from schools in the United Arab Emirates for references to practices or actions that defy Arab or Islamic beliefs, such as pigs or alcohol.[70]In the same manner,Animal Farmhas also faced relatively recent issues in China. In 2018, the Chinese government decided to censor all online posts about or referring toAnimal Farm.[73]However, the book itself, as of 2019, remains sold in stores. Amy Hawkins and Jeffrey Wasserstrom ofThe Atlanticstated in 2019 that the book is widely available in mainland China for several reasons: because censors believe the general public is unlikely to read a highbrow book, because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway, and because the Communist Party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as a liability. The authors stated: ""It was – and remains – as easy to buy1984andAnimal FarminShenzhenorShanghaias it is in London or Los Angeles"".[74]An enhanced version of the book, launched in India in 2017, was widely praised for capturing the author's intent, by republishing the proposed preface of the First Edition and the preface he wrote for the Ukrainian edition.[75]Analysis[edit]Animalism[edit]""Seven Commandments"" redirects here. For the Noahide code, seeSeven Laws of Noah. For The Bronx Is Burning episode, seeThe Seven Commandments.After the revolution, Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into ""a complete system of thought"", which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric reference toCommunism, not to be confused withthe philosophy of Animalism. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with humans that the Seven Commandments had explicitly prohibited. They also engage in trade, one of Old Major's proposed forbidden activities not directly included in the commandments (the other two being living in houses and smoking tobacco). Squealer is employed to alter the commandments to account for this humanisation, anallusionto the Soviet government's revising of history to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.[76]Squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written (ch. viii) – preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon byNorman Pettand Donald FreemanThe original commandments are:Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.No animal shall wear clothes.No animal shall sleep in a bed.No animal shall drink alcohol.No animal shall kill any other animal.All animals are equal.These commandments are also distilled into the maxim ""Four legs good, two legs bad!"" which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm, often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism.Later, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:No animal shall sleep in a bedwith sheets.No animal shall drink alcoholto excess.No animal shall kill any other animalwithout cause.All animals are equalbut some animals are more equal than others.Eventually, only the seventh commandment remains, and the ""legs"" maxim is replaced by ""Four legs good, two legs better!"", as the pigs become moreanthropomorphic. This is anironictwist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which was supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply politicaldogmacan be turned into malleablepropaganda.[77]Significance and allegory[edit]The Hoof and Horn flag described in the book appears to be based on thehammer and sickle, the Communist symbol. By the end of the book when Napoleon takes full control, the Hoof and Horn is removed from the flag.Orwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, ""virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory"".[78]Orwell himself wrote in 1946, ""Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution ... [and]that kindof revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power-hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [–] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert"".[79]In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, ""for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement. On my return from Spain [in 1937] I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages"".[80]The revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell's analogy with theOctober 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. TheBattle of the Cowshedhas been said to represent theallied invasionofSoviet Russiain 1918,[30]and the defeat of theWhite Russiansin theRussian Civil War.[29]The pigs' rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon's emergence as the farm's sole leader reflects Stalin's emergence.[31]The pigs' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, ""the turning point of the story"" as Orwell termed it in a letter toDwight Macdonald,[79]stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left-wing 1921Kronstadt revoltagainst the Bolsheviks,[79]and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the variousfive-year plans. The puppies controlled by Napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the Stalinist structure, and the pigs' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s.[81]In chapter seven, when the animals confess their non-existent crimes and are killed, Orwell directly alludes to the purges, confessions andshow trialsof the late 1930s. These contributed to Orwell's conviction that the Bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the Soviet system become rotten.[82]Peter Edgerly FirchowandPeter Davisoncontend that theBattle of the Windmill, specifically referencing theBattle of Stalingradand theBattle of Moscow, representsWorld War II.[29][30]During the battle, Orwell first wrote, ""All the animals, including Napoleon"" took cover. Orwell had the publisher alter this to ""All the animals except Napoleon"" in recognition of Stalin's decision to remain in Moscow during the German advance.[83]Orwell requested the change after he metJózef Czapskiin Paris in March 1945. Czapski, a survivor of theKatyn Massacreand an opponent of the Soviet regime, told Orwell, as Orwell wrote toArthur Koestler, that it had been ""the character [and] greatness of Stalin"" that saved Russia from the German invasion.[f]Front row (left to right):Rykov,Skrypnyk, andStalin– 'When Snowball comes to the crucial points in his speeches he is drowned out by the sheep (Ch. V), just as in theparty Congress in 1927[above], at Stalin's instigation 'pleas for the opposition were drowned in the continual, hysterically intolerant uproar from the floor'. (Isaac Deutscher[84])Other connections that writers have suggested illustrate Orwell's telescoping of Russian history from 1917 to 1943,[85][g]including the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the Rebellion, which stands for the abortive revolutionsin HungaryandGermany(Ch. IV); the conflict between Napoleon and Snowball (Ch. V), parallelling ""the two rival and quasi-Messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another:Trotskyism, with its faith in therevolutionary vocationof the proletariat of the West; and Stalinism with its glorification ofRussia's socialist destiny"";[86]Napoleon's dealings with Whymper and the Willingdon markets (Ch. VI), paralleling theTreaty of Rapallo; and Frederick's forged bank notes, parallelling theMolotov–Ribbentrop Pactof August 1939, after which Frederick attacks Animal Farm without warning and destroys the windmill.[27]The book's close, with the pigs and men in a kind ofrapprochement, reflected Orwell's view of the 1943Tehran Conference[h]that seemed to display the establishment of ""the best possible relations between the USSR and the West"" – but in reality were destined, as Orwell presciently predicted, to continue to unravel.[87]The disagreement between the allies and the start of theCold Waris suggested when Napoleon and Pilkington, both suspicious, each ""played an ace of spades simultaneously"".[83]Similarly, the music in the novel, starting with ""Beasts of England"" and the later anthems, parallels ""The Internationale"" and its adoption and repudiation by the Soviet authorities as the anthem of the USSR in the 1920s and 1930s.[88]According toMasha Gessen, the metamorphosis of the seventh commandment (""some animals are more equal"") was likely inspired by similar change of a party line which declared all Soviet people equal: the Russian nation and language suddenly became ""first among equals"" in official CPSU publications in 1936–1937.[89]Adaptations[edit]Stage productions[edit]A National Youth Theatre performance of Animal Farm at Soulton HallA theatrical version, with music byRichard Peasleeand lyrics byAdrian Mitchell, was staged at theNational TheatreLondon on 25 April 1984, directed byPeter Hall. It toured nine cities in 1985.[90]A solo version, adapted and performed byGuy Masterson, premiered at theTraverse TheatreEdinburgh in January 1995 and has toured worldwide since.[91][92]In 2021, during pandemic restrictions, theNational Youth Theatretoured a stage version ofAnimal Farm;this run included outdoor performances on a farm atSoulton Hall.[93]A new adaptation written and directed byRobert Icke, designed byBunny Christiewith puppetry designed and directed by Toby Olié opened at theBirmingham Repertory Theatrein January 2022 before touring the UK.[94]The Russian composerAlexander Raskatovhas written anoperabased on the book. Its premiere took place on 4 March 2023 in Amsterdam as part ofDutch National Opera's 2022/2023 season.[95]Films[edit]Animal Farmhas been adapted to film twice. Both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties, including sanitising some aspects.[citation needed]Animal Farm(1954) is an animated film, in which Napoleon is eventually overthrown in a second revolution. In 1974,E. Howard Huntrevealed that he had been sent by theCIA'sPsychological Warfaredepartment to obtain the film rights from Orwell's widow, and the resulting 1954 animation was funded by the agency.[96][97]Animal Farm(1999) is a live-action TV version that shows Napoleon's regime collapsing in on itself, with the farm having new human owners, reflecting the collapse of Soviet communism.[98]Andy Serkisis directing anupcoming animated film adaptation.[99]Radio dramatisations[edit]A BBC radio version, produced byRayner Heppenstall, was broadcast in January 1947. Orwell listened to the production at his home in Canonbury Square, London, withHugh Gordon Porteous, amongst others. Orwell later wrote to Heppenstall that Porteous, ""who had not read the book, grasped what was happening after a few minutes"".[100]A further radio production, again using Orwell's dramatisation of the book, was broadcast in January 2013 onBBC Radio 4.Tamsin Greignarrated, and the cast includedNicky Hensonas Napoleon,Toby Jonesas the propagandist Squealer, andRalph Inesonas Boxer.[101]Comic strip[edit]AForeign Officecopy of the first instalment of Pett and Freeman'sAnimal Farmcomic stripIn 1950,Norman Pettand his writing partnerDon Freemanwere secretly hired by theInformation Research Department, a secret department of theForeign Office, to adaptAnimal Farminto a comic strip. This comic was not published in the United Kingdom but ran in Brazilian and Burmese newspapers.[102]Video game[edit]Developers Nerial and The Dairymen released a game based on the book in December 2020, entitledOrwell's Animal Farm, forWindows,macOS,iOSandAndroidin coordination with the Orwell Estate.See also[edit]Information Research DepartmentAuthoritarian personalityHistory of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union (1917–1927)History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)IdeocracyNew classAnthems inAnimal FarmAnimals, an album based onAnimal FarmBooks[edit]Gulliver's Travelswas a favourite book of Orwell's.Swiftreverses the role of horses and human beings in the fourth book.

Gollancz became very angry at this insinuation; however, on 4 April 1944, he recognized his error of judgment: ""You were right and I was wrong. I am so sorry.

It was hisdebut novel. He began writing it in 1953; the novel was first published in 1961. Often cited as one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century,[3]it uses a distinctive non-chronologicalthird-person omniscientnarration, describing events from the points of view of different characters. The separate storylines are out of sequence so the timeline develops along with the plot.The novel is set duringWorld War II, from 1942 to 1944. It mainly follows the life ofantiheroCaptainJohn Yossarian, aU.S. Army Air ForcesB-25bombardier. Most of the events in the book occur while the fictional 256th US Army Air Squadron is based on the island ofPianosa, in theMediterranean Seawest of the Italian mainland, although it also includes episodes from basic training atLowry Fieldin Colorado and Air Corps training atSanta Ana Army Air Basein California. The novel examines theabsurdityof war and military life through the experiences of Yossarian and his cohorts, who attempt to maintain their sanity while fulfilling their service requirements so that they may return home.The book was made into afilm adaptationin 1970, directed byMike Nichols, and aminiseriesin 2019, produced byGeorge Clooney. In 1994, Heller published a sequel to the novel entitledClosing Time.Synopsis[edit]The main character, Yossarian, is introduced in the setting of a military hospital where he has retreated under the guise of a chronic liver condition to avoid flying further combat missions since he has grown disillusioned with the war effort and distrustful of his commanding officers. Throughout the novel, thecommanding officersshow extreme disregard for the lives of their troops and are all too willing to sacrifice their men to further their own ends. Especially,Colonel Cathcartvolunteers his unit to fly dangerous missions and forces his men to fly more combat missions than any other unit, constantly raising the number of missions necessary to complete a tour of duty so that the men can never return home, because he wishes to be seen as brave by his superiors even though he has only ever flown a single combat mission. After flying forty-four combat missions, Yossarian has becometraumatizedby aerial combat and witnessing the deaths of his friends; he is terrified of being killed in action during each combat mission, but still succeeds in flying twenty-seven more missions over the course of the novel, totaling seventy-one by the end. As the novel progresses, Yossarian's moral character and courage emerge more clearly, in contrast to his seeming selfishness and cowardice when first introduced. He is shown to be an honest, loyal, and able flyer who has been pushed to desperation by the selfishness and cowardice of the authorities responsible for him, especially doctors and military leaders.The development of the novel can be split into sections:The first (chapters 1–11) broadly follows the story fragmented between characters, but in a single chronological time in 1944.The second (chapters 12–20) flashes back to focus primarily on the ""Great Big Siege ofBologna"" before once again jumping to the third part.The third is the chronological present of 1944 (chapter 21–25).The fourth (chapters 26–28) flashes back to the origins and growth ofMilo'ssyndicate.The fifth part (chapters 28–32) returning again to the narrative present and maintaining the tone of the previous four.The sixth and final part (chapter 32 and on) remains in the story's present, but takes a much darker turn and emphasizes  the darkness and brutality of war and life in general.[4]For most of the book, the reader is cushioned from directly experiencing the full horror of war, but the existence of these horrors is implied by the extreme trauma and fear that afflicts the airmen. In the final section, these events are laid bare. The horror begins with a pointless attack on an undefended Italian mountain village, with the succeeding chapters incorporating depictions of despair (Doc Daneekaand thechaplain), disappearance in combat (Orrand Clevinger), disappearance caused by the army (Dunbar) and death of most of Yossarian's friends (Nately, McWatt, Kid Sampson, Dobbs, Chief White Halfoat and Hungry Joe), culminating in the horrors of Chapter 39, in particularAarfy'srape and murder of the innocent young woman Michaela.[4]In Chapter 41 the full details of the death of Snowden are finally revealed.Nevertheless, the novel ends on an upbeat note with Yossarian learning ofOrr'smiraculous escape to Sweden and Yossarian's pledge to follow him there.Style[edit]Many events in the book are repeatedly described from differing points of view, so the reader learns more about each event from eachiteration, with the new information often completing a joke, the setup of which was told several chapters previously. The narrative's events are out of sequence, but events are referred to as if the reader is already familiar with them so that the reader must ultimately piece together a timeline of events. Specific words, phrases, and questions are also repeated frequently, generally to comic effect.[citation needed]Much of Heller's prose inCatch-22is circular and repetitive, exemplifying in its form the structure of aCatch-22.Circular reasoningis widely used by some characters to justify their actions and opinions. Heller revels inparadox. For example: ""The Texanturned out to be good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no one could stand him,"" and ""The case against Clevinger was open and shut. The only thing missing was something to charge him with."" This atmosphere of apparently logical irrationality pervades the book.[citation needed]This style is also recognizable regarding how exactly Clevinger's trial would be executed by Lieutenant Scheisskopf: ""As a member of the Action Board, Lieutenant Scheisskopf was one of the judges who would weigh the merits of the case against Clevinger as presented by the prosecutor. Lieutenant Scheisskopf was also the prosecutor. Clevinger had an officer defending him. The officer defending him was Lieutenant Scheisskopf.""[5]: 76While a few characters are most prominent, especially Yossarian and the Chaplain, the majority of named characters are described in detail with fleshed out or multidimensional personas to the extent that there are few if any ""minor characters"". There are no traditional heroes in the novel, reflecting the underlying commentary that war has no heroes, only victims.[6]Although its nonchronological structure may at first seem random,Catch-22is highly structured. It is founded on a structure offree association; ideas run into one another through seemingly random connections. For example, Chapter 1, titled ""The Texan"", ends with ""everybody but theCID man, who had caught a cold from the fighter captain and come down with pneumonia.""[5]: 24Chapter 2, titled ""Clevinger"", begins with ""In a way, the CID man was pretty lucky because outside the hospital the war was still going on.""[5]: 25The CID man connects the two chapters like a free association bridge and eventually Chapter 2 flows from the CID man to Clevinger through more free association links.As Heller utilizes an episodic structure for most of the novel, many chapters may appear to be a disjointed series of events with little or no connection with each other. However, individual chapters often deal with thematically unique ideas, such as Chapter 11 (“Captain Black”) which parodiesRed Scare-eraMcCarthyism, and Chapter 18 (“The Soldier Who Saw Everything Twice”) which explores theological concepts of mortality.Themes[edit]Paradox[edit]Yossariancomes to fear his commanding officers more than he fears the Germans attempting to shoot him down and he feels that ""they"" are ""out to get him."" The reason Yossarian fears his commanders more than the enemy is that as he flies more missions,Colonel Cathcartincreases the number of required combat missions before a soldier may return home; he reaches the magic number only to have it retroactively raised. He comes to despair of ever getting home and is greatly relieved when he is sent to the hospital for a condition that is almostjaundice. In Yossarian's words:The enemy is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter whichsidehe's on, and that includes Colonel Cathcart. And don't you forget that, because the longer you remember it, the longer you might live.[5]: 124Tragedy and farce[edit]Much of the farce in the novel is fueled by intentional and unintentional miscommunication, occasionally leading to tragic consequences. For example, Cathcart's desire to become a general is thwarted by ex-P.F.C. Wintergreen sabotaging his correspondence. Major Major's and Yossarian's mis-censoring of correspondence is blamed on the Chaplain, who is threatened with imprisonment as a result.Theodicy[edit]Yossarianquestions the idea thatGod is all-powerful, all-good, and all knowing. The narrator seems to believe that God, if not evil, is incompetent. In chapter 18, Yossarian states that he ""believes in the God he doesn't believe in"", this version of God having created Hitler, the war, and all the failures of human life and society, as exemplified in the following passage:""And don't tell meGod works in mysterious ways"", Yossarian continued, hurtling over her objections. ""There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's not working at all. He's playing or else He's forgotten all about us. That's the kind of God you people talk about – a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatological mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did he ever create pain? … Oh, He was really being charitable to us when He gave us pain! [to warn us of danger] Why couldn't He have used a doorbell instead to notify us, or one of His celestial choirs? Or a system of blue-and-red neon tubes right in the middle of each person's forehead. Any jukebox manufacturer worth his salt could have done that. Why couldn't He? … What a colossal, immortal blunderer! When you consider the opportunity and power He had to really do a job, and then look at the stupid, ugly little mess He made of it instead, His sheer incompetence is almost staggering. …""[6]Later Heller writes of Yossarian wandering through a war-torn Italian city (Chapter 39):""Yossarian quickened his pace to get away, almost ran. The night was filled with horrors, and he thought he knew how Christ must have felt as he walked through the world, like a psychiatrist through a ward full of nuts, like a victim through a prison full of thieves. What a welcome sight a leper must have been. At the next corner a man was beating a small boy brutally in the midst of an immobile crowd of adult spectators who made no effort to intervene ...""[7]Military-industrial complex[edit]While the military's enemies are Germans, none appear in the story as enemy combatants. This ironic situation is epitomized in the single appearance of German personnel in the novel, who act as pilots employed by the squadron's mess officer,Milo Minderbinder, to bomb the American encampment on Pianosa. This predicament indicates a tension between traditional motives for violence and the modern economic machine, which seems to generate violence simply as another means to profit, quite independent of geographical or ideological constraints which creates amilitary–industrial complex.[8]Heller emphasizes the danger of profit-seeking by portraying Milo without ""evil intent"". Milo's actions are portrayed as the result of greed, not malice.[9]Characters[edit]Further information:List of Catch-22 charactersThe novel has over 50 named characters, many of whom have titular chapters dedicated to expanding on their personalities or motivations.Influences[edit]Heller wanted to be a writer from an early age. His experiences as abombardierduring World War II inspiredCatch-22;[10]Heller later said that he ""never had a bad officer"". In a 1977 essay onCatch-22, Heller stated that the ""antiwar and antigovernment feelings in the book"" were a product of the Korean War and the 1950s rather than World War II itself. Heller's criticisms are not intended for World War II but for the Cold War andMcCarthyism.[11]The influence of the 1950s onCatch-22is evident through Heller's extensive use ofanachronism. Though the novel is ostensibly set in World War II, Heller intentionally included anachronisms likeloyalty oathsandcomputers(IBMmachines) to situate the novel in the context of the 1950s.[9]Many of the characters are based on or connected to individuals from the 1950s:Milo Minderbinder's maxim ""What's good for M&M Enterprises is good for the country"" alludes to the former president ofGeneral MotorsCharles Erwin Wilson's 1953 statement before the Senate: ""What's good for General Motors is good for the country.""[9]The question of ""Who promotedMajor Major?"" alludes toJoseph McCarthy's questioning of the promotion ofMajor Peress, an army dentist who refused to sign loyalty oaths.[9]Czech writerArnošt Lustigrecounts in his book3x18that Joseph Heller told him that he would never have writtenCatch-22had he not first readThe Good Soldier ŠvejkbyJaroslav Hašek.[12]In 1998, some critics raised the possibility that Heller's book had questionable similarities toLouis Falstein's 1950 novel,Face of a Hero. Falstein never raised the issue betweenCatch-22'spublication and his death in 1995 and Heller claimed never to have been aware of the obscure novel. Heller said that the novel had been influenced byCéline,WaughandNabokov. Many of the similarities have been stated to be attributable to the authors' experiences, both having served as U.S. Army Air Forces aircrew in Italy in World War II. However, their themes and styles are different.[13]Concept[edit]Main article:Catch-22 (logic)A ""Catch-22"" is ""a problem for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule"".[14]For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one's glasses, one cannot see to look for them – a Catch-22. The term ""Catch-22"" is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation.In the book, Catch-22 is a military rule typifyingbureaucraticoperation and reasoning. The rule is not stated in a precise form, but the principal example in the book fits the definition above: If one is crazy, one does not have to fly missions; and one must be crazy to fly. But one has to apply to be excused, and applying demonstrates that one is not crazy. As a result, one must continue flying, either not applying to be excused, or applying and being refused. The narrator explains:There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind.Orrwas crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to, but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle. (p. 56, ch. 5)Other forms of Catch-22 are invoked throughout the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions. At one point, victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs' explanation of one of Catch-22's provisions: ""Catch-22 states that agents enforcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating."" Another character explains: ""Catch-22 saysthey have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing.""Yossarian comes to realize that Catch-22 does not actually exist, but because the powers that be claim it does, and the world believes it does, it nevertheless has potent effects. Indeed, because it does not exist, there is no way it can be repealed, undone, overthrown, or denounced. The combination of force with specious and spurious legalistic justification is one of the book's primary motifs.The motif of bureaucratic absurdity is further explored in 1994'sClosing Time, Heller's sequel toCatch-22. This darker, slower-paced, apocalyptic novel explores the pre- and post-war lives of some of the major characters inCatch-22, with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer.Literary allusions[edit]Catch-22contains allusions to many works of literature.Howard Jacobson, in his 2004 introduction to the Vintage Classics publication, wrote that the novel was ""positioned teasingly ... between literature and literature's opposites – betweenShakespeareandRabelaisandDickensandDostoevskyandGogolandCélineand theAbsurdistsand of courseKafkaon the one hand, and on the othervaudevilleandslapstickandBilkoandAbbott and CostelloandTom and Jerryandthe Goons(if Heller had ever heard of the Goons).""[15]One critic argues that it is Kafka's influence that can be seen most strongly in the novel:  ""Like Kafka's heroes, Yossarian is riddled with anxiety and caught in an inexorable nightmare – in his case created by Colonel Cathcart and the inevitability of his raising the number of missions he has to fly.""[16]Historical context[edit]The idea forCatch-22was based on Joseph Heller's personal experience in World War II. The feelings that Yossarian and the other bomber crew felt were taken directly from problems he suffered while on duty. Heller flew 60 bombing missions from May to October in 1944. Heller was able to make it out of the war, but it took until 1953 before he could start writing about it. For this reason, the book contains references to post World War II phenomena like IBM computers andloyalty oaths. The war experience turned Heller into a ""tortured, funny, deeply peculiar human being"".[17]After publication in 1961,Catch-22became very popular among teenagers at the time.Catch-22seemed to embody the feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy ofCatch-22. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States. On October 26, 1986, professor and authorJohn W. Aldridgewrote a piece inThe New York Timescelebrating the 25th anniversary of the publishing ofCatch-22. He commented that Heller's book presaged the chaos in the world that was to come:The comic fable that ends in horror has become more and more clearly a reflection of the altogether uncomic and horrifying realities of the world in which we live and hope to survive.[18]Title[edit]The title refers to a fictional bureaucratic stipulation that embodies illogical and immoral reasoning. The idea being that if one pleads insanity to stop flying missions with a high mortality rate, one is in fact sane; however, one must be insane to keep flying those exact missions.[8]The opening chapter of the novel was first published, in 1955, byNew World WritingasCatch-18, but Heller's agent, Candida Donadio, asked him to change the title, to avert its confusion withLeon Uris's recently publishedMila 18.[19]A reference was made to this nomenclatural history in the 2023NetflixshowBeef.[20][relevant?]The implications in Judaism of the number18– which refers tochai, meaning ""alive"", inGematria– were relevant to Heller's somewhat greater emphasis on Jewish themes in early drafts of his novel.[21]Heller's daughter Erica wrote that the Simon & Schuster editor, Robert Gottlieb, was the person who came up with the number 22, and Gottlieb himself stated that he did in the documentaryTurn Every Page: The Adventures of Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb.[22]Parallels among a number of character exchanges in the novel suggested the doubled-one title ofCatch-11, but the 1960 release ofOcean's Eleveneliminated that.[19]Catch-17was rejected so as not to be confused with the World War II filmStalag 17, as wasCatch-14, apparently because the publisher did not believe that 14 was a ""funny number"". Eventually, the title came to beCatch-22, which, like 11, has a duplicated digit, with the 2 also referring to a number ofdéjà vu-like events common in the novel.[21]Publication and movie rights[edit]Catch-22was sold toSimon & Schuster, where it had been championed by editorRobert Gottlieb, who, along withNina Bourne, edited and oversaw the marketing of the book.[19]Gottlieb was a strong advocate for the book along withPeter SchwedandJustin Kaplan. Henry Simon, a vice president at Simon & Schuster, found it repetitive and offensive.[19]The editorial board decided to contract the book when Heller agreed to revisions; he signed forUS$1,500in 1961 (equivalent to about $15,800 in 2024).[19]Officially published on October 10, 1961, the hardcover sold for $5.95. The book was not a best-seller in hardcover in the United States. Though twelve thousand copies were sold byThanksgiving, it never enteredThe New York TimesBest Seller list. It received good notices and was nominated for theNational Book Awardin March 1962, thoughWalker Percy'sThe Moviegoerwon.Catch-22went through four printings in hardcover but sold well on only the East Coast. The book never established itself nationally until it was published in paperback for 75 cents.[23]: 224–230Upon publication in Great Britain, the book became the No. 1 best-seller.[23]: 233Don Fine ofDell Paperbacksbought the paperback reprint rights toCatch-22for $32,000. Between the paperback's release in September 1962 and April 1963, it sold 1.1 million copies.[23]: 238–240In August 1962, Donadio brokered the sale of movie rights toColumbia Picturesfor $100,000 plus $25,000 to write a treatment or a first draft of a screenplay.[23]: 234Reception[edit]The initial reviews of the book ranged from very positive to very negative. There were positive reviews fromThe Nation(""the best novel to come out in years""), theNew York Herald Tribune(""A wild, moving, shocking, hilarious, raging, exhilarating, giant roller-coaster of a book"") andThe New York Times(""A dazzling performance that will outrage nearly as many readers as it delights""). On the other hand,The New Yorkerdisliked it (""doesn't even seem to be written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper"", ""what remains is a debris of sour jokes""), and a second review from theNew York Timesalso disliked it (""repetitive and monotonous. Or one can say that it is too short because none of its many interesting characters and actions is given enough play to become a controlling interest"").[24]One commentator ofCatch-22recognized that ""many early audiences liked the book for just the same reasons that caused others to hate it"".[25]: 11The book eventually gained a cult following, especially among teenagers and college students. Heller later remarked that in 1962, after appearing on theTodayshow he went out drinking with the host at the time,John Chancellor, who handed him stickers that Chancellor had got privately printed reading ""YOSSARIAN LIVES"". Heller also said that Chancellor had been secretly putting them on the walls of the corridors and executive bathrooms in the NBC building.[25]: 11Although the novel won no awards upon release, it has remained in print and is seen as one of the most significant American novels of the 20th century.[3]Scholar and fellow World War II veteranHugh Nibleysaid it was the most accurate book he ever read about the military.[26]As of 2016[update]over ten million copies have been sold.[27]Although he continued writing, including a sequel novelClosing Time, Heller's later works were inevitably overshadowed by the success ofCatch-22. When asked by critics why he had never managed to write another novel as good as his first, Heller would retort with a smile, ""Who has?""[28]Challenges[edit]Catch-22has landed on the list of theAmerican Library Association's banned and challenged classics.In 1972, the school board inStrongsville, Ohio, removedCatch-22, as well as two books byKurt Vonnegut, from school libraries and the curriculum.[29]Five families sued the school board. TheSixth Circuit Court of Appealsrejected the claim, stating that school boards had the right to control the curriculum.[30]The decision was overturned on appeal in 1976.[29][31]The court wrote, ""A library is a storehouse of knowledge. Here we are concerned with the right of students to receive information which they and their teachers desire them to have.""[30][32]In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court employed a similar rationale in its decision inIsland Trees School District v. Picoon the removal of library books.[30]Because the book refers to some women as ""whores"", it was challenged at theDallas, Texas, Independent School District(1974) andSnoqualmie, Washington(1979).[29][31]Rankings[edit]External videos""50th Anniversary of Joseph Heller'sCatch-22""–Lesley Stahlmoderating a panel made up ofChristopher Buckley,Robert Gottlieb,Mike Nichols, andScott Shepherd, October 18, 2011,C-SPAN[33]TheModern LibraryrankedCatch-22as the 7th (by review panel) and 12th (by public) greatest English-language novel of the 20th century.[34]TheRadcliffe Publishing CourserankedCatch-22as number 15 of the 20th century's top 100 novels.[35]The ObserverlistedCatch-22as one of the 100 greatest novels of all time.[36]TimeputsCatch-22in the top 100 English-language modern novels (1923 onwards, unranked).[37]TheBig Readby theBBCrankedCatch-22as number 11 on a web poll of the UK's best-loved book.[38]Adaptations[edit]Opening title of the film adaptationCatch-22was adapted into afeature film of the same namein 1970, directed byMike Nichols.Alan Arkinportrayed Capt.Yossarian, with an ensemble cast includingArt Garfunkelas Nately,Jon VoightasMilo Minderbinder,Orson Wellesas General Dreedle, andMartin BalsamasColonel Cathcart, amongst many others.Apilotfor a comedy series based uponCatch-22was made and televised in 1973, withRichard Dreyfussin the starring role of Yossarian.[39]Catch-22play:Aquila Theatreproduced a stage adaptation ofCatch-22, based on Heller's 1971 stage adaptation.

Books,Charlotte's_Web,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte's_Web,Charlotte's Web,"1952 children's novel by E. B. WhiteThis article is about the book. For other uses, seeCharlotte's Web (disambiguation).Not to be confused withCharlotte Webb.Charlotte's WebFirst editionAuthorE. B. WhiteIllustratorGarth WilliamsCover artistGarth WilliamsLanguageEnglishGenreChildren'sPublisherHarper & BrothersPublication dateOctober 15,1952Publication placeUnited StatesPages192ISBN9780062658753Charlotte's Webis a book ofchildren's literatureby American authorE. B. Whiteand illustrated byGarth Williams. It was published on October 15, 1952, byHarper & Brothers. It tells the story of alivestockpignamed Wilbur and his friendship with abarn spidernamed Charlotte. When Wilbur is in danger of beingslaughtered, Charlotte writes messages in her web praising him, such as ""Some Pig"", ""Terrific"", ""Radiant"", and ""Humble"", to persuade the farmer to spare his life.The book is considered a classic of children's literature, enjoyed by readers of all ages.[1]The description of the experience of swinging on a rope swing at the farm is an often-cited example of rhythm in writing, as the pace of the sentences reflects the motion of the swing. In 2000,Publishers Weeklylisted the book as the best-selling children's paperback of all time.[2]The book was adapted into ananimated feature filmproduced byHanna-Barbera Productionsand Sagittarius Productions and distributed byParamount Picturesin 1973. In 2003, the company released adirect-to-videosequel,Charlotte's Web 2: Wilbur's Great Adventure;Universal released the film internationally.[3]Alive-action feature filmadaptation of the book was released in 2006. Avideo game based on this adaptationwas released that same year.Plot[edit]The Arable family are a farm family who raise and sell animals. One day, John Arable attempts to slaughter theruntof a litter of piglets that were born the night before, but his daughter Fern pleads for the piglet's life, and John gives him to her. Naming him Wilbur, Fern treats him as a pet, and the two become incredibly close. Eventually, Wilbur is no longer small, and so John decides to sell him, to Fern's dismay. Wilbur is given to Fern's maternal uncle, Homer Zuckerman, allowing her to periodically visit him.From here on, the various farm animals are depicted asanthropomorphic. In Zuckerman's barnyard, Wilbur yearns for Fern and is met with varying reactions from the other animals, with some, such as the motherly goose, showing him compassion, and others, such as the head ram, treating him with scorn. One day, the ram offhandedly tells Wilbur that Zuckerman is raising him for slaughter and consumption, leaving him distraught. As he mourns his fate, abarn spidernamed Charlotte, whose web sits in a doorway overlooking his pigpen, comforts him. She promises to find a way to save his life and takes on a motherly role for him. Meanwhile, Fern often listens in on the animals' conversations, to her mother's concern.As summer passes, Charlotte comes up with a plan to save Wilbur. Reasoning that Zuckerman would not kill a famous pig, she weaves words and short phrases in praise of Wilbur into her web, the first phrase being ""Some Pig"". This turns Wilbur, and the barn as a whole, into a tourist attraction because many people believe the web to be a miracle. After the excitement dies down, the phrase gets destroyed. On the goose's suggestion, Charlotte weaves the word ""Terrific"" into her web, beginning the cycle anew. Although Zuckerman is pleased with Wilbur's fame, his plan to slaughter him stays firm. In another effort to maintain the public's interest in him, Charlotte tells Templeton, a gluttonous rat that lives under Wilbur's trough and holds a contentious relationship with the other animals, to get another word for the web. Templeton finds a laundry detergent ad with the word ""Radiant"", which Charlotte then weaves into her web.As a result of this latest round of fame, Zuckerman enters Wilbur in the county fair, and Charlotte and Templeton accompany him. The Arables also go to the fair, but Fern, despite still cherishing Wilbur, has matured, and instead spends time with her childhood sweetheart, Henry Fussy. Charlotte weaves another word brought by Templeton, ""Humble"", into the web she spins at Wilbur's stall at the fair. Wilbur fails to win first prize, but is awarded a special prize by the judges. Charlotte, who has laid anegg sacat the fair, hears the presentation of the award over the public address system and realizes that the prize means Zuckerman will cherish Wilbur for as long as he lives and will never slaughter him. However, Charlotte, being a barn spider with a naturally short lifespan, is already dying of natural causes by the time the award is announced. Knowing that she has saved Wilbur, and satisfied with the outcome of her life, she decides not to return to the barn with Wilbur and Templeton. She gives them her final request to have her egg sac taken back to the barn, and then dies alone at the fairgrounds.Wilbur waits out the winter, during which Charlotte's children hatch. Most of them fly away, to Wilbur's dismay, but three choose to remain. Future descendants of Charlotte keep Wilbur company for many years, though he always holds Charlotte in more esteem than them all.Characters[edit]Wilburis a rambunctious pig, theruntof hislitter. He is often strongly emotional.CharlotteA. Cavatica, or simply Charlotte, is a spider who befriends Wilbur. In some passages, she is theheroineof the story.[4]John Arableis Wilbur's first owner.Fern Arableis John's daughter who adopts Wilbur when he's a piglet and later visits him. She is the only human in the story capable of understanding animal conversation.Lurvyis the hired man at Zuckerman's farm and the first to read the message in Charlotte's web.Templetonis aratwho helps Charlotte and Wilbur only when offered food. He serves as a somewhat caustic, self-servingcomic reliefto the plot.Avery Arableis Fern's elder brother and John's son. Like Templeton, he is a source of comic relief.Homer Zuckermanis Fern's uncle who keeps Wilbur in his barn. He has a wife named Edith and an assistant named Lurvy.Other animalsin Zuckerman's barn, with whom Wilbur converses, include a disdainfullamb, a talkativegoose, and an intelligent ""oldsheep"".Henry Fussyis a boy of Fern's age, of whom Fern becomes fond.Dr. Dorianis the family physician/psychologist consulted by Fern's mother and something of awise old mancharacter.Uncleis a large pig whom Charlotte disdains for his coarse manners but is recognized as Wilbur's rival at the fair.Charlotte's childrenare the 514 children of Charlotte the spider. Although they were born at the barn, all but three of them (Joy, Aranea, and Nellie) go their own ways byballooning.Themes[edit]Death[edit]Deathis a major theme seen throughout the book and is brought forth by that of Charlotte. According to Norton D. Kinghorn, Charlotte's web acts as a barrier that separates the two worlds of life and death.[5]Scholar Amy Ratelle says that through Charlotte's continual killing and eating offliesthroughout the book, White makes the concept of death normal for Wilbur and the readers.[6]Neither Wilbur nor Templeton sees death as a part of their lives; Templeton sees it only as something that will happen at some time in the distant future, while Wilbur views it as the end of everything.[7]Wilbur constantly has death on his mind at night when he is worrying over whether or not he will be slaughtered.[8]Even though he is able to escape his death, Charlotte, who takes care of him, is not able to escape her own. She passes away, but, according to Trudelle H. Thomas, ""even in the face of death, life continues and ultimate goodness wins out"".[9]Jordan Anne Deveraux explains that E.B. White discusses a fewrealitiesof death. From the novel, readers learn that death can be delayed but that no one can avoid it forever.[10]Change[edit]For Norton D. Kinghorn, Charlotte's web also acts as a signifier ofchange. The change Kinghorn refers to is that of both the human world and the farm/barn world. For both of these worlds, change is something that can't be avoided.[5]Along with the changing of theseasonsthroughout the book, the characters also go through their own changes. Jordan Anne Deveraux also explains that Wilbur and Fern each go through their changes to transition fromchildhoodcloser to adulthood throughout the novel.[10]This is evidenced by Wilbur accepting death and Fern giving up her dolls. Wilbur grows throughout the book, allowing him to become the caretaker of Charlotte's children just as she was a caretaker for him, as is explained by scholar Sue Misheff.[11]But rather than accept the changes that are forced upon them, according to Sophie Mills, the characters aim to go beyond the limits of change.[8]In a different way, Wilbur goes through a change when he switches locations. Amy Ratelle explains that when he moves from the Arables' farm to Homer Zuckerman's farm, he goes from being a loved pet to a farm animal.Innocence[edit]Fern goes from being a child to being more of an adult. As she experiences this change, Kinghorn notes that it can also be considered a fall frominnocence.[5]Wilbur also starts out young and innocent at the beginning of the book. A comparison is drawn between the innocence and youth of Fern and Wilbur. Sophie Mills states that they can identify with one another.[8]Both Wilbur and Fern are, at first, horrified by the realization that life must end; however, by the end of the book, they learn to accept that, eventually, everything must die.[10]According to Matthew Scully, the book presents the difference in the worldview of adults versus the worldview of children. Children, such as Fern, believe killing another for food is wrong, while adults have been gradually conditioned to believe that it is natural.[12]History[edit]The book was published three years after White began writing it.[13]His editor,Ursula Nordstrom, said that one day in 1952, he arrived at her office and handed her a new manuscript, the only copy of the book then in existence, which she read soon after and enjoyed.[14]The book was released on October 15, 1952.[15][16][17]In light of White'sDeath of a Pig, published in 1948,[18]which gives an account of his own failure to save a sick pig (bought for butchering), the book can be seen as his attempt ""to save his pig in retrospect"".[19]His overall motivation for the book has not been revealed, and he once wrote: ""I haven't told why I wrote the book, but I haven't told you why I sneeze, either. A book is a sneeze.""[20]DearVladimir:There is a large grey spider that commonly inhabits out-buildings and sheds, and I turn to you on the chance that you know her and can enlighten me as to certain of her more intimate habits and functions—this because she figures in a book I am writing and I find myself, at this point, stuck....—E. B. White, October 8, 1950[21]White encountered the spider at his farm inHancock County, Mainein October 1950. Unable to identify it himself, he asked his friendVladimir Nabokov, the novelist and lepidopterist, for advice. Nabokov replied that he knew ""nothing at all"" about spiders, but suggested that White contactWillis J. Gertschat theAmerican Museum of Natural History.[21]Gertsch's bookAmerican Spiderswas one of the sources for the arachnid anatomical terms (mentioned in the beginning of chapter nine), along withThe Spider BookbyJohn Henry Comstock, both of which combine a sense of poetry with scientific fact.[22]White incorporated details from Comstock's accounts of baby spiders, most notably the ""flight"" of the young spiders on silken parachutes.[22]He sent Gertsch's book to illustratorGarth Williams.[23]Williams's initial drawings depicted a spider with a woman's face, and White suggested that he simply draw a realistic spider instead.[24]White's original name for the novel's spider character was Charlotte Epeira (afterEpeira sclopetaria, the Grey Cross spider, now known asLarinioides sclopetarius), before discovering that the more modern name for that genus wasAranea.[25]In the book, Charlotte gives her full name as ""Charlotte A. Cavatica"", revealing her as a barn spider, anorb-weaverwith the scientific nameAraneus cavaticus.[citation needed]White originally opened the book with an introduction of Wilbur and the barnyard (which later became the third chapter) but decided to begin the book by introducing Fern and her family on the first page.[23]White's publishers were at one point concerned with the end and tried to get him to change it.[26]Charlotte's Webhas become White's most famous book, but he treasured his privacy and that of the farmyard and barn that helped inspire it, which have been kept off limits to the public according to his wishes.[27]Reception[edit]The book was generally well-reviewed when it was released. InThe New York Times,Eudora Weltywrote: ""As a piece of work it is just about perfect, and just about magical in the way it is done.""[28]Aside from its paperback sales, the book is 78th on the all-time bestselling hardback book list. According to publicity for the 2006 film adaptation (see below), it has sold more than 45 million copies and been translated into 23 languages. It was aNewbery Honorbook for 1953, losing toSecret of the AndesbyAnn Nolan Clarkfor themedal.[29][30]In 1970, White won theLaura Ingalls Wilder Medal, a major prize in the field of children's literature, forCharlotte's Webalong with his first children's book,Stuart Little(1945).[31]Seth Lerer, in his bookChildren's Literature, finds that Charlotte represents female authorship and creativity, and compares her to other female characters in children's literature such as Jo March inLittle Womenand Mary Lennox inThe Secret Garden.[32]Nancy Larrickbrings to attention the ""startling note of realism"" in the opening line, ""Where's Papa going with that ax?""[33]IllustratorHenry Coleexpressed his deep childhood appreciation of the characters and story, and calls Garth Williams's illustrations full of ""sensitivity, warmth, humor, and intelligence"".[34]Illustrator Diana Cain Bluthenthal states that Williams' illustrations inspired and influenced her.[35]An unabridged audio book read by White himself reappeared decades after it had originally been recorded.[36]Newsweekwrites that White reads the story ""without artifice and with a mellow charm"", and that ""White also has a plangency that will make you weep, so don't listen (at least, not to the sad parts) while driving"".[36]Joe Berk, president of Pathway Sound, had recorded the book with White in his neighbor's house in Maine (which Berk describes as an especially memorable experience) and released it in LP.[37]From Michael Sims: ""The producer later said that it took him 17 takes to read the death scene of Charlotte. And finally, they would walk outside, and E.B. White would go, this is ridiculous, a grown man crying over the death of an imaginary insect. And then, he would go in and start crying again when he got to that moment.""[38]Bantam releasedCharlotte's WebalongsideStuart Littleon CD in 1991, digitally remastered, having acquired the two books for rather a large amount.[37]In 2005, a teacher in California conceived of a project for her class in which they would send out hundreds of drawings of spiders (each representing Charlotte's child, Aranea, going out into the world so that she can return and tell Wilbur of what she has seen) with accompanying letters; they ended up visiting a large number of parks, monuments, and museums, and were hosted by and/or prompted responses from celebrities and politicians such asJohn Travoltaand then-First LadyLaura Bush.[39]In 2003, the book was listed at number 170 on the BBC'sThe Big Readpoll of the UK's 200 ""best-loved novels"".[40]A 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for third-graders in schools inSan Diego County, California.[41]Based on a 2007 online poll, theNational Education Associationlisted it as one of its ""Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children.""[42]It was one of the ""Top 100 Chapter Books"" of all time in a 2012 poll bySchool Library Journal.[43]In 2010, theNew York Public Libraryreported thatCharlotte's Webwas the sixth most borrowed book in its history.[44]Its awards and nominations include:John Newbery Honor Book(1953)[45]Horn Book Fanfare(1952)[46]Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal(1970) (awarded to White for his children's books:Charlotte's WebandStuart Little)Massachusetts Children's Book Award(1984)[47]Adaptations[edit]Film[edit]The book was adapted intoan animated feature of the same namein 1973[48]byHanna-Barbera Productionsand Sagittarius Productions and released byParamount Pictureswith a score by theSherman Brothers.

For other uses, seeThe Da Vinci Code (disambiguation).The Da Vinci CodeThe first U.S. editionAuthorDan BrownSeriesRobert Langdon#2GenreMystery,detective fiction,conspiracy fiction,thrillerPublisherDoubleday(US)Publication dateMarch 18, 2003[1]Publication placeUnited StatesPages689 (U.S. hardback)489 (U.S. paperback)ISBN0-385-50420-9(US)OCLC50920659Dewey Decimal813/.54 21LC ClassPS3552.R685434 D3 2003Preceded byAngels & DemonsFollowed byThe Lost SymbolThe Da Vinci Codeis a 2003mysterythriller novelbyDan Brown. It is “the best-selling American novel of all time.”[2]Brown's second novel to include the characterRobert Langdon—the first was his 2000 novelAngels & Demons—The Da Vinci CodefollowssymbologistLangdon andcryptologistSophie Neveu after a murder in theLouvre Museumin Paris entangles them in a dispute between thePriory of SionandOpus Deiover the possibility ofJesusandMary Magdalenehaving had a child together.The novel explores an alternative religious history, whose central plot point is that theMerovingiankings of Francewere descended fromthe bloodline of Jesus ChristandMary Magdalene, ideas derived from Clive Prince'sThe Templar Revelation(1997) and books byMargaret Starbird. The book also refers toThe Holy Blood and the Holy Grail(1982), although Brown stated that it was not used as research material.[3]The Da Vinci Codeprovoked a popular interest in speculation concerning theHoly Graillegend and Mary Magdalene's role in thehistory of Christianity. The book has been extensively denounced by manyChristian denominationsas an attack on theCatholic Church, and also consistently criticized by scholars forits historical and scientific inaccuracies. The novel became a massive worldwidebestseller,[4]selling 80 million copies as of 2009[update],[5]and has been translated into 44 languages. In November 2004,Random Housepublished a Special Illustrated Edition with 160 illustrations. In 2006,a film adaptationwas released byColumbia Pictures.Plot[edit]Louvrecurator andPriory of Siongrand master Jacques Saunière is fatally shot one night at the museum by analbinoCatholic monk named Silas, who is working on behalf of someone he knows only as the Teacher, who wishes to discover the location of the ""keystone"", an item crucial in the search for theHoly Grail. After Saunière's body is discovered in the pose of theVitruvian ManbyLeonardo da Vinci, the police summon Harvard professor Robert Langdon, who is in town on business. Police captain Bezu Fache tells him that he was summoned to help the police decode the cryptic message Saunière left during the final minutes of his life. The message includes aFibonacci sequenceout of order and an anagram: ""O, draconian devil! Oh, lame saint!"" Langdon explains to Fache that the pentacle Saunière drew on his chest in his own blood represents an allusion to the goddess and not devil worship, as Fache believes.Sophie Neveu, a policecryptographer, secretly explains to Langdon that she is Saunière's estranged granddaughter and that Fache thinks Langdon is the murderer because the last line in her grandfather's message, which was meant for Neveu, said ""P.S. Find Robert Langdon"", which Fache had erased prior to Langdon's arrival.  However, ""P.S."" does not refer to ""postscript"", but rather to Sophie—the nickname given to her by her grandfather was ""Princess Sophie"". She understands that her grandfather intended Langdon to decipher the code, which leads to Leonardo da Vinci'sMona Lisa, which in turn leads to his paintingMadonna of the Rocks. They find a pendant that holds the address of the Paris branch of the Depository Bank of Zurich.Replica cryptex: prize fromGoogleDa Vinci CodeQuest ContestNeveu and Langdon escape from the police and visit the bank. In the safe deposit box, which is unlocked with the Fibonacci sequence, they find a box containing the keystone: acryptex, a cylindrical, hand-held vault with five concentric, rotating dials labeled with letters. When they are lined up correctly, they unlock the device, but if the cryptex is forced open, an enclosed vial of vinegar breaks and dissolves the message inside the cryptex, which was written onpapyrus. The box containing the cryptex contains clues to its password.Langdon and Neveu take the keystone to the home of Langdon's friend, Sir Leigh Teabing, an expert on the Holy Grail, the legend of which is heavily connected to the Priory. There, Teabing explains that the Grail is not a cup but connected toMary Magdalene, and that she was Jesus Christ's wife and is the person to his right inThe Last Supper. The trio then flee the country on Teabing's private plane, on which they conclude that the proper combination of letters spells out Neveu's given name, Sofia. Opening the cryptex, they discover a smaller cryptex inside it, along with another riddle that ultimately leads the group to the tomb ofIsaac NewtoninWestminster Abbey.During the flight to Britain, Neveu reveals the source of her estrangement from her grandfather ten years earlier: arriving home unexpectedly from university, Neveu secretly witnessed a spring fertility rite conducted in the secret basement of her grandfather's country estate. From her hiding place, she was shocked to see her grandfather with a woman at the center of a ritual attended by men and women who were wearing masks and chanting praise to the goddess. She fled the house and broke off all contact with Saunière. Langdon explains that what she witnessed was an ancient ceremony known ashieros gamosor ""sacred marriage"".By the time they arrive atWestminster Abbey, Teabing is revealed to be the Teacher for whom Silas is working. Teabing wishes to use the Holy Grail, which he believes is a series of documents establishing thatJesus Christmarried Mary Magdalene and fathered children, in order to ruin theVatican. He compels Langdon at gunpoint to solve the second cryptex's password, which Langdon realizes is ""apple"". Langdon secretly opens the cryptex and removes its contents before tossing the empty cryptex in the air. Teabing is arrested by Fache, who by now realizes that Langdon is innocent. Bishop Aringarosa, head of religious sectOpus Deiand Silas' mentor, realizing that Silas has been used to murder innocent people, rushes to help the police find him. When the police find Silas hiding in an Opus Dei Center, Silas assumes that they are there to kill him and he rushes out, accidentally shooting Bishop Aringarosa. Bishop Aringarosa survives but is informed that Silas was found dead later from a gunshot wound.The final message inside the second keystone leads Neveu and Langdon toRosslyn Chapel, whose docent turns out to be Neveu's long-lost brother, whom Neveu had been told died as a child in the car accident that killed her parents. The guardian of Rosslyn Chapel, Marie Chauvel Saint Clair, is Neveu's long-lost grandmother and Saunière's wife who was the woman who participated with him in the ""sacred marriage"". It is revealed that Neveu and her brother are descendants of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Priory of Sion hid her identity to protect her from possible threats to her life. The real meaning of the last message is that the Grail is buried beneath the smallpyramiddirectly belowLa Pyramide Inversée, the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre. It also lies beneath the ""Rose Line"", an allusion to ""Rosslyn"". Langdon figures out this final piece to the puzzle; he follows the Rose Line (prime meridian) toLa Pyramide Inversée, where he kneels to pray before the hidden sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, as theTemplar knightsdid before.Characters[edit]Robert Langdon: A professor of symbology at Harvard University and the protagonist of the novel.Jacques Saunière: The grandmaster of the Priory of Sion, Curator of Louvre Museum.Sophie Neveu: A cryptologist of the French police and granddaughter of Saunière.Bezu Fache: A member of Opus Dei and a French police captain.Silas / The Monk: A member of Opus Dei who murders Saunière and the secondary antagonist of the novel.Manuel Aringarosa: A bishop of the Vatican and member of Opus Dei.Sister Sandrine: A Seneschal of the Priory of Sion and nun of St. Sulpice.André Vernet: A guard of Zurich bank.Sir Leigh Teabing / The Teacher: A Grail scholar and British expatriate living in Paris, and the main antagonist of the novel.Rémy Legaludec: A servant who assists Teabing.Jérôme Collet: A French police lieutenant and Fache's deputy.Marie Chauvel Saint-Clair: Sophie's grandmother.Reaction[edit]Sales[edit]The Da Vinci Codewas a major success in 2003, outsold only byJ. K. Rowling'sHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.[6]As of 2016, it had sold 80 million copies worldwide.[7]Historical inaccuracies[edit]Main article:Criticism of The Da Vinci CodeA woman protesting againstThe Da Vinci Codefilm outside a movie theater inCulver City, California. The TFP acronym in the banner stands for theAmerican Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property.The Da Vinci Codegenerated criticism when it was first published for the fictitious description of the core aspects of Christianity and descriptions ofEuropean art, history, and architecture. The book has received negative reviews mostly from Catholic and other Christian communities. Many critics took issue with the level of research Brown did when writing the story.The New York Timeswriter Laura Miller characterized the novel as ""based on a notorious hoax"", ""rank nonsense"", and ""bogus"", saying the book is heavily based on the fabrications ofPierre Plantard, who is asserted to have created the Priory of Sion in 1956.[8]Critics accuse Brown of distorting and fabricating history.Theologicalauthor Marcia Ford considered that novels should be judged not on their literary merit, but on their conclusions:Regardless of whether you agree with Brown's conclusions, it's clear that his history is largely fanciful, which means he and his publisher have violated a long-held if unspoken agreement with the reader: Fiction that purports to present historical facts should be researched as carefully as a nonfiction book would be.[9]Richard Abaneswrote:The most flagrant aspect... is not that Dan Brown disagrees with Christianity but that he utterly warps it in order to disagree with it... to the point of completely rewriting a vast number of historical events. And making the matter worse has been Brown's willingness to pass off his distortions as 'facts' with which innumerable scholars and historians agree.[9]Much of the controversy generated byThe Da Vinci Codewas due to the fact that the book was marketed as being historically accurate; the novel opens with a ""fact"" page that states that ""The Priory of Sion—a Frenchsecret societyfounded in 1099—is a real organization"", whereas thePriory of Sionis a hoax created in 1956 byPierre Plantard, which Plantard admitted under oath in 1994, well before the publication ofThe Da Vinci Code.[10]The fact page itself is part of the novel as a fictional piece, but is not presented as such. The page also states that ""all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents... and secret rituals in this novel are accurate"", a claim disputed by numerous academic scholars and experts in numerous areas.[11]Brown addressed the idea of some of the more controversial aspects being fact on his website, stating that the page at the beginning of the novel mentions only ""documents, rituals, organization, artwork and architecture"" but not any of the ancient theories discussed by fictional characters, stating that ""Interpreting those ideas is left to the reader"". Brown also says, ""It is my belief that some of the theories discussed by these characters may have merit"" and ""the secret behindThe Da Vinci Codewas too well documented and significant for me to dismiss.""[12]In 2003, while promoting the novel, Brown was asked in interviews what parts of the history in his novel actually happened. He replied ""Absolutely all of it.""[13]In a 2003 interview with CNN'sMartin Savidgehe was again asked how much of the historical background was true. He replied, ""99% is true... the background is all true"".[14]Asked byElizabeth Vargasin anABC Newsspecial if the book would have been different if he had written it as non-fiction he replied, ""I don't think it would have.""[15]In 2005, UK TV personalityTony Robinsonedited and narrated a detailed rebuttal of the main arguments of Brown and those ofMichael Baigent,Richard LeighandHenry Lincoln, who authored the bookHoly Blood, Holy Grail, in the programThe Real Da Vinci Code, shown onBritish TVChannel 4. The program featured lengthy interviews with many of the main protagonists cited by Brown as ""absolute fact"" inThe Da Vinci Code. Arnaud de Sède, son ofGérard de Sède, stated categorically that his father and Plantard had made up the existence of thePrieuré de Sion, the cornerstone of theJesus bloodlinetheory: ""frankly, it was piffle"",[16]noting that the concept of a descendant of Jesus was also an element of the 1999Kevin SmithfilmDogma.The earliest appearance of this theory is due to the 13th-centuryCistercianmonk and chroniclerPeter of Vaux de Cernaywho reported thatCatharsbelieved that the 'evil' and 'earthly' Jesus Christ had a relationship with Mary Magdalene, described as hisconcubine(and that the 'good Christ' was incorporeal and existed spiritually in the body of Paul).[17]The programThe Real Da Vinci Codealso cast doubt on the Rosslyn Chapel association with the Grail and on other related stories, such as the alleged landing of Mary Magdalene in France.According toThe Da Vinci Code, the Roman EmperorConstantine IsuppressedGnosticismbecause it portrayed Jesus as purely human.[18]The novel portrays Constantine as wanting Christianity to act as a unifying religion for theRoman Empire, thinking that Christianity would appeal topagansonly if it featured ademigodsimilar to pagan heroes. According to theGnostic Gospels, Jesus was merely a human prophet, not a demigod. Therefore, to change Jesus' image, Constantine destroyed the Gnostic Gospels and promoted the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, which portray Jesus as divine or semi-divine; however, most scholars agree that all Gnostic writings depict Christ as purely divine, his human body being a mere illusion (docetism).[19]Gnostic sects saw Christ this way because they regarded matter as evil, and therefore believed that a divine spirit would never have taken on a material body.[20]Literary reception[edit]The book received both positive and negative reviews from critics, and it has been the subject of negative appraisals concerning its portrayal of history. Its writing and historical accuracy were reviewed negatively byThe New Yorker,[21]Salon.com,[22]andMaclean's.[23]Positive[edit]Janet MaslinofThe New York Timessaid that one word ""concisely conveys the kind of extreme enthusiasm with which this riddle-filled, code-breaking, exhilaratingly brainy thriller can be recommended. That word is wow. The author is Dan Brown (a name you will want to remember). In this gleefully erudite suspense novel, Mr. Brown takes the format he has been developing through three earlier novels and fine-tunes it to blockbuster perfection.""[24]David Lazarus ofThe San Francisco Chroniclesaid, ""This story has so many twists—all satisfying, most unexpected—that it would be a sin to reveal too much of the plot in advance. Let's just say that if this novel doesn't get your pulse racing, you need to check your meds.""[25]The book appeared at number 43 on a 2010 list of 101 best books ever written, which was derived from a survey of more than 15,000 Australian readers.[26]Disparaging[edit]Stephen Kinglikened Brown's work to ""Jokes for the John"", calling such literature the ""intellectual equivalent ofKraft Macaroni and Cheese"".[27]Roger Ebertdescribed it as a ""potboiler written with little grace and style"", although he added it did ""supply an intriguing plot"".[28]In his review of the filmNational Treasure, whose plot also involves ancient conspiracies and treasure hunts, he wrote: ""I should read a potboiler likeThe Da Vinci Codeevery once in a while, just to remind myself that life is too short to read books likeThe Da Vinci Code.""[29]While interviewingUmberto Ecoin a 2008 issue ofThe Paris Review,Lila Azam ZanganehcharacterizedThe Da Vinci Codeas ""a bizarre little offshoot"" of Eco's novel,Foucault's Pendulum. In response, Eco remarked, ""Dan Brown is a character fromFoucault's Pendulum!I invented him. He shares my characters' fascinations—the world conspiracy ofRosicrucians,Masons, andJesuits. The role of the Knights Templar. Thehermetic secret. The principle that everything is connected. I suspect Dan Brown might not even exist.""[30]Negative[edit]Salman Rushdiesaid during a lecture, ""Do not start me onThe Da Vinci Code. A novel so bad that it gives bad novels a bad name.""[31]Stephen Fryhas referred to Brown's writings as ""complete loose stool-water"" and ""arse gravy of the worst kind"".[32]In a live chat on June 14, 2006, he clarified, ""I just loathe all those book[s] about theHoly Grailand Masons and Catholic conspiracies and all that botty-dribble. I mean, there's so much more that's interesting and exciting in art and in history. It plays to the worst and laziest in humanity, the desire to think the worst of the past and the desire to feel superior to it in some fatuous way.""[33]A. O. Scott, reviewing the movie based on the book forThe New York Times, called the book ""Dan Brown's best-selling primer on how not to write an English sentence"".[34]The New YorkerreviewerAnthony Lanerefers to it as ""unmitigated junk"" and decries ""the crumbling coarseness of the style"".[21]LinguistGeoffrey Pullumand others posted several entries critical of Brown's writing, atLanguage Log, calling Brown one of the ""worst prose stylists in the history of literature"" and saying Brown's ""writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily, thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad"".[35]Lawsuits[edit]AuthorLewis Perduealleged that Brown plagiarized two of his novels,The Da Vinci Legacy, originally published in 1983, andDaughter of God, originally published in 2000. He sought to block distribution of the book and film. However,Judge George Danielsof theUS District Court in New Yorkruled against Perdue in 2005, saying that ""A reasonable average lay observer would not conclude thatThe Da Vinci Codeis substantially similar toDaughter of God"" and that ""Any slightly similar elements are on the level of generalized or otherwise unprotectable ideas.""[36]Perdue appealed; the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the original decision, saying Mr. Perdue's arguments were ""without merit"".[37]In early 2006, Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh filed suit against Brown's publisher, Random House. They alleged that significant portions ofThe Da Vinci Codewere plagiarized fromThe Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, violating their copyright.[38]Brown confirmed during the court case that he named the principal Grail expert of his story Leigh Teabing, an anagram of ""Baigent Leigh"", after the two plaintiffs. In reply to the suggestion thatHenry Lincolnwas also referred to in the book, since he has medical problems resulting in a severe limp, like the character of Leigh Teabing, Brown stated he was unaware of Lincoln's illness and the correspondence was a coincidence.[39]Since Baigent and Leigh had presented their conclusions as historical research, not as fiction,Mr Justice Peter Smith, who presided over the trial, deemed that a novelist must be free to use these ideas in a fictional context, and ruled against Baigent and Leigh. Smith also hidhis own secret codein his written judgment, in the form of seemingly random italicized letters in the 71-page document, which apparently spell out a message. Smith indicated he would confirm the code if someone broke it.[40]After losing before theHigh Courton July 12, 2006, Baigent and Leigh appealed to theCourt of Appeal, unsuccessfully.[39][40]In April 2006 Mikhail Anikin, a Russian scientist and art historian working as a senior researcher at theHermitage Museumin St Petersburg, stated the intention to bring a lawsuit against Brown, maintaining that he was the one who coined the phrase used as the book's title and one of the ideas regarding theMona Lisaused in its plot. Anikin interprets theMona Lisato be a Christian allegory consisting of two images, one of Jesus Christ that comprises the image's right half, and one of the Virgin Mary that forms its left half. According to Anikin, he expressed this idea to a group of experts from the Museum of Houston during a 1988René Magritteexhibit at the Hermitage, and when one of the Americans requested permission to pass it along to a friend Anikin granted the request on condition that he be credited in any book using his interpretation. Anikin eventually compiled his research intoLeonardo da Vinci or Theology on Canvas, a book published in 2000, butThe Da Vinci Code, published three years later, makes no mention of Anikin and instead asserts that the idea in question is a ""well-known opinion of a number of scientists"".[41][42]Brown has been sued twice in U.S. Federal courts by the author Jack Dunn who claims Brown copied a huge part of his bookThe Vatican Boysto writeThe Da Vinci CodeandAngels & Demons. Neither lawsuit was allowed to go to a jury trial. In 2017, in London, another claim was begun against Brown by Jack Dunn who claimed that justice was not served in the U.S. lawsuits.[43]Possibly the largest reaction occurred inKolkata, India, where a group of around 25 protesters ""stormed"" Crossword bookstore, pulled copies of the book from the racks, and threw them to the ground. On the same day, a group of 50–60 protesters successfully made theOxford Bookstoreon Park Street decide to stop selling the book ""until the controversy sparked by the film's release was resolved"".[44]Thus in 2006, sevenIndian states(Nagaland,Punjab,Goa,Tamil Nadu,Andhra Pradesh) banned the release or exhibition of theHollywoodmovieThe Da Vinci Code(as well as the book).[45]Later, two states, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, lifted the ban under high court order.[46][47]Release details[edit]The book has been translated into over 44 languages, primarily hardcover.[48]Major English-language (hardcover) editions include:The Da Vinci Code(1st ed.), US: Doubleday, April 2003,ISBN0-385-50420-9.The Da Vinci Code(spec illustr ed.), Doubleday, November 2, 2004,ISBN0-385-51375-5(as of January 2006, has sold 576,000 copies).The Da Vinci Code, UK: Corgi Adult, April 2004,ISBN0-552-14951-9.The Da Vinci Code(illustr ed.), UK: Bantam, October 2, 2004,ISBN0-593-05425-3.The Da Vinci Code(trade paperback), US/CA: Anchor, March 2006.The da Vinci code(paperback), Anchor, March 28, 2006, 5 million copies.The da Vinci code(paperback) (special illustrated ed.), Broadway, March 28, 2006, released 200,000 copies.Goldsman, Akiva(May 19, 2006),The Da Vinci Code Illustrated Screenplay: Behind the Scenes of the Major Motion Picture, Howard, Ron; Brown, Dan introd, Doubleday, Broadway, the day of the film's release.

During its opening weekend, moviegoers spent an estimated $77 million in America, and $224 million worldwide.[50]The movie received mixed reviews. Roger Ebert in its review wrote that ""Ron Howard is a better filmmaker than Dan Brown is a novelist; he follows Brown's formula (exotic location, startling revelation, desperate chase scene, repeat as needed) and elevates it into a superior entertainment, with Tom Hanks as a theo-intellectual Indiana Jones... it's involving, intriguing and constantly seems on the edge of startling revelations.""[28]The film received two sequels:Angels & Demons, released in 2009, andInferno, released in 2016.

R. R. Tolkien. Set inMiddle-earth, the story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 children's bookThe Hobbitbut eventually developed into a much larger work. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949,The Lord of the Ringsis one of thebest-selling books ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.[2]The title refers to the story's mainantagonist,[b]theDark LordSauron, whoin an earlier agecreated theOne Ring, allowing him to rule the otherRings of Powergiven tomen,dwarves, andelves, in his campaign to conquer all of Middle-earth. From homely beginnings inthe Shire, ahobbitland reminiscent of the English countryside, the story ranges across Middle-earth, followingthe questto destroy the One Ring, seen mainly through the eyes of the hobbitsFrodo,Sam,Merry, andPippin. Aiding the hobbits are the wizardGandalf, the menAragornandBoromir, the elfLegolas, and the dwarfGimli, who unite as theCompany of the Ringin order to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth against Sauron's armies and give Frodo a chance to destroy the One Ring in the fires ofMount Doom.Although often called a trilogy, the work was intended by Tolkien to be a single volume in a two-volume set, along withThe Silmarillion.[3][T 3]For economic reasons, it was first published over the course of a year, from 29 July 1954 to 20 October 1955,in three volumesrather than one,[3][4]under the titlesThe Fellowship of the Ring,The Two Towers, andThe Return of the King;The Silmarillionappeared only after the author's death. The work is divided internally into six books, two per volume, with several appendices of chronologies, genealogies, and linguistic information.[c]These three volumes were later published as aboxed setin 1957, and even finally as a single volume in 1968, following the author's original intent.Tolkien's work, after an initially mixedreceptionby the literary establishment, has been the subject ofextensive analysis of its themes,literary devices, and origins.Influenceson this earlier work, and on the story ofThe Lord of the Rings, includephilology, mythology,Christianity,earlier fantasy works, andhis own experiences in the First World War.The Lord of the Ringsis considered one of the most influential fantasy books ever written, and has helped to create and shape the modern fantasy genre. Since release, it has been reprinted many times andtranslated into at least 38 languages.[d]Its enduring popularity has led to numerous references in popular culture, the founding of many societies byfans of Tolkien's works,[5]and the publication of many books about Tolkien and his works. It hasinspired many derivative works, including paintings, music,films, television,video games, and board games.Award-winningadaptations ofThe Lord of the Ringshave been made forradio,theatre, andfilm. It was named Britain's best-loved novel of all time in a 2003 poll by theBBCcalledThe Big Read.Plot[edit]The Fellowship of the Ring[edit]Further information:The Fellowship of the Ring § ContentsGandalfproves thatFrodo's Ring is theOne Ringby throwing it into Frodo's fireplace, revealing the hidden text of theRhyme of the Rings.Bilbo Bagginscelebrates his birthday and leaves the Ring toFrodo, his heir.Gandalf(awizard) suspects it is aRing of Power; seventeen years later, he confirms it is the One Ring, lost by the Dark LordSauron, and counsels Frodo to take it away from the Shire. Gandalf leaves, promising to return, but fails to do so. Frodo sets out on foot with his cousinPippin Tookand gardenerSam Gamgee. They are pursued byBlack Riders, but meet someElves, whose singing toElberethwards off the Riders. The Hobbits take an evasive shortcut to Bucklebury Ferry, where they meet their friendMerry Brandybuck. Merry and Pippin reveal they know about the Ring and insist on joining Frodo on his journey. They try to shake off the Black Riders by cutting through theOld Forest. Merry and Pippin are trapped by the malignOld Man Willow, but are rescued byTom Bombadil. Leaving Tom's house, they are caught by abarrow-wight. Frodo, awakening from the barrow-wight's spell, calls Tom Bombadil, who frees them and gives them ancient swords from the wight's hoard. 
The Hobbits reach the village ofBree, where they meetStrider, aRanger. The innkeeper gives Frodo an old letter from Gandalf, which identifies Strider as a friend. Knowing the Black Riders will attempt to seize the Ring, Strider guides the group toward theElvishsanctuary ofRivendell. AtWeathertop, they are attacked by five Black Riders. Their leader wounds Frodo with a cursed blade. Strider fights them off and treats Frodo with the herbathelas. They are joined by the ElfGlorfindel, who rides with Frodo, now deathly ill, towards Rivendell. The Black Riders pursue Frodo into the Ford of Bruinen, where they are swept away by flood waters summoned byElrond.Frodo recovers in Rivendell under Elrond's care. Gandalf informs Frodo that the Black Riders are theNazgûl, Men enslaved by Rings of Power to serve Sauron.The Council of Elronddiscusses what to do with the Ring. Strider is revealed to be Aragorn, the heir ofIsildurwho had cut the Ring from Sauron's hand in the Second Age, but claimed it for himself. The Ring was lost when Isildur was killed; it passed toGollumand then to Bilbo. Gandalf reports that the chief wizard,Saruman, is a traitor.The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed in the fire ofMount DoominMordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond chooses companions for him: Sam, Merry, and Pippin; Gandalf; the Men Aragorn andBoromir, son of theSteward of Gondor; the ElfLegolas; and theDwarfGimli, representing the Free Peoples of the West.
After a failed attempt to cross theMisty Mountains, the Fellowship risk the path through theMines of Moria. They learn thatBalinand his Dwarves, who had attempted to regain possession of Moria, were killed byOrcs. They are attacked by Orcs and aBalrog, a fire demon. Gandalf confronts the Balrog: both fall into an abyss. The others escape to theElvish forestofLothlórien, where the LadyGaladrieltests their loyalty, and gives them magical gifts. She allows Frodo and Sam to look into her vision-giving fountain, the Mirror of Galadriel. Frodo offers her the Ring: she refuses, knowing that it would master her.
Galadriel's husband Celeborn gives the Fellowship boats, cloaks, and waybread. They travel down theRiver Anduin. At Amon Hen, Boromir tries to take the Ring, but Frodo puts on the Ring and disappears. Frodo chooses to cross the river and go alone to Mordor, but Sam, guessing what he intends, intercepts and joins him.The Two Towers[edit]Further information:The Two Towers § ContentsA party of Orcs sent bySarumanandSauronattack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two Hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs. The Orcs are killed byRiders of Rohan, led byÉomer. The Hobbits escape intoFangornForest, where they are befriended by theEntTreebeard. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf: he explains that he killed the Balrog; he too was killed in the fight, but was sent back to Middle-earth. He is now Gandalf the White, replacing Saruman as chief of the wizards. They ride toEdoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees KingThéodenfrom the influence of Saruman's spyGríma Wormtongue. Théoden musters his army and rides to the fortress ofHelm's Deep; Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard. The Ents destroyIsengard, Saruman's stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower ofOrthanc. Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army ofHuornsto Théoden's aid. He brings an army of Riders of Rohan to Helm's Deep. They defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns and are destroyed. Gandalf, Théoden, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Isengard, where they find Merry and Pippin relaxing amidst the ruins. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. Wormtongue throws down a hard round object to try to kill Gandalf. Pippin picks it up; Gandalf swiftly takes it, but Pippin steals it in the night. It is apalantír, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron, becoming ensnared. Sauron sees Pippin, but misunderstands the circumstances. Gandalf rides forMinas Tirith, chief city ofGondor, taking Pippin with him.Frodo and Sam struggle through the barren hills of theEmyn Muil. They realize they are being tracked; on a moonlit night they capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. Frodo makes Gollum swear to serve him, as Ringbearer, and asks him to guide them to Mordor. Gollum leads them across theDead Marshes. Sam overhears Gollum debating with his alter ego, Sméagol, whether to steal the Ring.
TheBlack Gateof Mordor is too well guarded, so they travel south throughIthiliento a secret pass that Gollum knows. They are captured by rangers led byFaramir, Boromir's brother, and brought to the secret fastness ofHenneth Annûn. Faramir resists the temptation to seize the Ring and, disobeying orders to arrest strangers, releases them. Gollum guides the hobbits to the pass, but leads them into the lair of the great spiderShelobin the tunnels ofCirith Ungol. Frodo holds up his gift, thePhial of Galadriel, which holds thelightofEärendil's star: it drives Shelob back. Frodo cuts through a giant web using his swordSting. Shelob attacks again, and Frodo falls to her venom. Sam picks up Sting and thePhial. He wounds the monster. Believing Frodo to be dead, a devestated Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Orcs take Frodo; Sam overhears them saying that Frodo is still alive, and sets out to rescue him.The Return of the King[edit]Further information:The Return of the King § ContentsSauron sends a great army againstGondor. Gandalf arrives atMinas Tirithto warnDenethorof the attack, while Théoden musters the Riders of Rohan to go to Gondor's aid. Minas Tirith is besieged; the Lord of the Nazgûl uses a spell-woundbattering ramto destroy the city's gates. Denethor, deceived by Sauron, falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre; Pippin and Gandalf rescue his son Faramir from the same fate. Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and theRangers of the North, takes thePaths of the Deadto recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, oathbreakers who will have no rest until they fight for the King of Gondor. Aragorn unleashes the Army of the Dead on theCorsairs of Umbarinvading southern Gondor. He and men of southern Gondor sail in the Corsairs' ships up theAnduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. Théoden's nieceÉowyn, who joined the army in disguise, kills the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry; both are wounded. Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron's army in theBattle of the Pelennor Fields, but Théoden is killed. Aragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals the sick. He leads an army through Ithilien to the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. At theBattle of the Morannon, his army is vastly outnumbered.Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. When they reach the edge of theCracks of Doom, Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer: he claims it for himself and puts it on. Gollum reappears. He bites off Frodo's Ring finger. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power. All he created collapses, the Nazgûl perish, Aragorn wins the battle of the Morannon, and theEaglesrescue Frodo and Sam from the ruin of Mount Doom. Aragorn is crowned King, and wedsArwen, Elrond's daughter. Théoden is buried; Éomer is crowned King of Rohan. His sister Éowyn is engaged to Faramir, now Steward of Gondor and Prince of Ithilien. Galadriel, Celeborn, and Gandalf say farewell to Treebeard, and to Aragorn. The four hobbits travel home, only to find it has been taken over by Saruman's men. Merry raises a rebellion andscours the Shire. Saruman reveals crimes that Wormtongue has done, causing Wormtongue to turn on Saruman and kill him in front ofBag End, Frodo's home. Wormtongue then is killed by hobbit archers. Merry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts to heal the Shire. Frodo, broken by the quest, leaves a few years later, sailing from theGrey Havensover the Sea to find peace.Extensive appendices outline more details of the history, cultures,genealogies, andlanguagesthat Tolkien imagined for the peoples of Middle-earth.In antiquarian style,[6]they provide background details for the narrative, with much detail for Tolkien fans who want to know more about the stories.Frame story[edit]Further information:Tolkien's frame storiesTolkien presentsThe Lord of the Ringswithin a fictionalframe storywhere he is not the original author, but merely the translator of part of an ancient document, theRed Book of Westmarch.[7]That book is modelled on the realRed Book of Hergest, which similarly presents an older mythology. Various details of the frame story appear in the Prologue, its ""Note onShireRecords"", and in the Appendices, notably Appendix F. In this frame story, theRed Bookis the purported source of Tolkien's other works relating toMiddle-earth:The Hobbit,The Silmarillion, andThe Adventures of Tom Bombadil.[8]Concept and creation[edit]Background[edit]Further information:Tolkien's legendariumAlthough a major work in itself,The Lord of the Ringswas only the last movement of a much older set of narratives Tolkien had worked on since 1917 encompassingThe Silmarillion,[9]in a process he described asmythopoeia.[e]The Lord of the Ringsstarted as a sequel to Tolkien's workThe Hobbit, published in 1937.[11]The popularity ofThe Hobbitled George Allen & Unwin, the publishers, to request a sequel. Tolkien warned them that he wrote quite slowly, and responded with several stories he had already developed. Having rejected his contemporary drafts forThe Silmarillion, puttingRoverandomon hold, and acceptingFarmer Giles of Ham, Allen & Unwin continued to ask for more stories abouthobbits.[12]Writing[edit]Main article:Constructing The Lord of the RingsNavigable diagram ofTolkien's legendarium.The Lord of the Ringsbegan as a sequel toThe Hobbitbut gradually took in elements of the legendarium, the mythology summarized inThe Silmarillion.Persuaded by his publishers, he started ""a new Hobbit"" in December 1937.[11]After several false starts, the story of the One Ring emerged. The idea for the first chapter (""A Long-Expected Party"") arrived fully formed, although the reasons behind Bilbo's disappearance, the significance of the Ring, and the titleThe Lord of the Ringsdid not come until the spring of 1938.[11]Originally, he planned to write a story in which Bilbo had used up all his treasure and was looking for another adventure to gain more; however, he remembered the Ring and its powers and thought that would be a better focus for the new work.[11]As the story progressed, he brought in elements fromThe Silmarillionmythology.[13]Writing was slow, because Tolkien had a full-time academic position, marked exams to bring in a little extra income, and wrote many drafts.[11][T 4]Tolkien abandonedThe Lord of the Ringsduring most of 1943 and only restarted it in April 1944,[11]as a serial for his sonChristopher Tolkien, who was sent chapters as they were written while he was serving in South Africa with theRoyal Air Force. Tolkien made another major effort in 1946 and showed the manuscript to his publishers in 1947.[11]The story was effectively finished the next year, but Tolkien did not complete the revision of earlier parts of the work until 1949.[11]The original manuscripts, which total 9,250 pages, now reside in the J. R. R. Tolkien Collection atMarquette University.[14]Poetry[edit]Main article:Poetry inThe Lord of the RingsUnusually for 20th century novels, the prose narrative is supplemented throughout byover 60 pieces of poetry. These include verse and songs of many genres: for wandering,marching to war,drinking, and having a bath; narrating ancient myths,riddles,prophecies, and magical incantations; and of praise and lament (elegy).[15]Some, such as riddles, charms, elegies, and narrating heroic actions are found inOld Englishpoetry.[15]Scholars have stated that the poetry is essential for the fiction to work aesthetically and thematically, as it adds information not given in the prose, and it brings out characters and their backgrounds.[16][17]The poetry has been judged to be of high technical skill, reflected in Tolkien's prose; for instance, he wrote much ofTom Bombadil's speech in metre.[18]Illustrations[edit]Main article:Non-narrative elements in The Lord of the RingsTolkien'scalligraphyof theRing Versewas one of the few illustrations in the first edition. It is written in theBlack SpeechofMordorusing theTengwarscript.Tolkien worked on the text usinghis maps of Middle-earthas a guide, to ensure the elements of the story fitted together in time and space.[T 5]He prepared a variety of types of illustration – maps, calligraphy, drawings, cover designs, even a facsimile painting of theBook of Mazarbul– but only the maps, the inscription on the Ring, and a drawing of theDoors of Durinwere included in the first edition.[19][T 6]The hardback editions sometimes had cover illustrations by Tolkien,[f]sometimes by other artists. According toThe New York Times,Barbara Remington's cover designs forBallantine's paperback editions ""achieved mass-cult status in the 1960s, particularly on college campuses"" across America.[20]Influences[edit]Main article:J. R. R. Tolkien's influencesBeowulf'seotenas ond ylfe ond orcneas, ""ogres and elves and devil-corpses"" helped to inspire Tolkien to create theOrcsandElvesofMiddle-earth.[21]Tolkien drew ona wide array of influencesincluding language,[T 7]Christianity,[T 8]mythologyandGermanic heroic legendincluding the NorseVölsunga saga,[22]archaeology, especially at the Temple ofNodens,[23]ancient and modern literature, like Finnish 19th-centuryepic poetryThe KalevalabyElias Lönnrot,[24]and personal experience. He was inspired primarily by his profession,philology;[T 9]his work centred on the study ofOld Englishliterature, especiallyBeowulf, and he acknowledgedits importance to his writings.[21]He was a gifted linguist, influenced by Celtic,[25][22]Finnish,[26]Slavic,[27]and Greek language and mythology.[28]Commentators have attempted to identify literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings; he acknowledged that he had enjoyed adventure stories by authors such asJohn BuchanandRider Haggard.[29][30][31]TheArts and CraftspolymathWilliam Morriswas a major influence,[T 10]and Tolkien undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home.[32]Tolkien stated, too, that he had been influenced by his childhood experiences of the English countryside ofWorcestershirenearSarehole Mill, and its urbanization by the growth ofBirmingham,[T 11]and his personal experience offighting in the trenchesof theFirst World War.[33]Moreover, the militarization and industrialization inspired the character of Sauron and his forces. The Orcs represented the worst of it as workers that have been tortured and brutalized by the war and industry.[34]Themes[edit]Main article:Themes ofThe Lord of the RingsScholars and critics have identifiedmany themes in the bookwith itscomplex interlaced narrative, including a reversedquest,[35][36]the struggle ofgood and evil,[37]death and immortality,[38]fate and free will,[39]the addictive danger of power,[40]and various aspects of Christianity such as the presence of three Christ figures, forprophet, priest, and king, as well as elements like hope andredemptive suffering.[41][42][43][44]There is a common theme throughout the work oflanguage,its sound, and its relationship to peoples and places, along with hints ofprovidencein descriptions of weather and landscape.[45]Out of these, Tolkien stated that the central theme is death and immortality.[T 12]To those who supposed that the book was anallegoryof events in the 20th century, Tolkien replied in the foreword to the Second Edition that it was not, saying he preferred ""history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.""Some commentators have criticized the book for being a story about men for boys, with no significant women; or about a purely rural world with no bearing on modern life in cities; of containing no sign of religion; or of racism. Other commentators responded by noting that there are threepowerful women in the book, Galadriel, Éowyn, and Arwen; that life, even in rural Hobbiton, is not idealized; thatChristianity is a pervasive theme; and thatTolkien was sharply anti-racistboth in peacetime and during the Second World War, while Middle-earth is evidently polycultural.[46][47][48]Others have discussed the apparent or implicitsexualityin the book.[49][50][51]Publication history[edit]A dispute with his publisher,Allen & Unwin, led Tolkien to offer the work toWilliam Collinsin 1950. Tolkien intendedThe Silmarillion(itself largely unrevised at this point) to be published along withThe Lord of the Rings,butAllen & Unwinwas unwilling to do this. AfterMilton Waldman, his contact at Collins, expressed the belief thatThe Lord of the Ringsitself ""urgently wanted cutting"", Tolkien eventually demanded that they publish the book in 1952.[52]Collins did not; and so Tolkien wrote toAllen & Unwin, telling that he would have gladly considered the publication of any part of the stuff, fearing his work would never see the light of day.[11]For publication, the work wasdivided into three volumesto minimize any potential financial loss due to the high cost of type-setting and modest anticipated sales:The Fellowship of the Ring(Books I and II),The Two Towers(Books III and IV), andThe Return of the King(Books V and VI, and six appendices).[53]Delays in producing appendices,mapsand especially an index led to the volumes being published later than originally hoped – on 29 July 1954, on 11 November 1954 and on 20 October 1955 respectively in the United Kingdom.[54]In the United States,Houghton MifflinpublishedThe Fellowship of the Ringon 21 October 1954,The Two Towerson 21 April 1955, andThe Return of the Kingon 5 January 1956.[55]The Return of the Kingwas especially delayed as Tolkien revised the ending and prepared appendices (some of which had to be left out because of space constraints). Tolkien did not like the titleThe Return of the King, believing it gave away too much of the storyline, but deferred to his publisher's preference.[56]Tolkien wrote that the titleThe Two Towers""can be left ambiguous"",[T 13]but considered naming the two asOrthancandBarad-dûr,Minas Tirithand Barad-dûr, or Orthanc and theTower of Cirith Ungol.[T 14]However, a month later he wrote a note published at the end ofThe Fellowship of the Ringand later drew a cover illustration, both of which identified the pair asMinas Morguland Orthanc.[57][58]Tolkien was initially opposed to titles being given to each two-book volume, preferring instead the use of book titles: e.g.The Lord of the Rings: Vol. 1,The Ring Sets OutandThe Ring Goes South; Vol. 2,The Treason of IsengardandThe Ring Goes East; Vol. 3,The War of the RingandThe End of the Third Age. However, these individual book titles were dropped, and after pressure from his publishers, Tolkien suggested the volume titles: Vol. 1,The Shadow Grows; Vol. 2,The Ring in the Shadow; Vol. 3,The War of the RingorThe Return of the King.[59][60]Because the three-volume binding was so widely distributed, the work is often referred to as theLord of the Rings""trilogy"". In a letter to the poetW. H. Auden, who famously reviewed the final volume in 1956,[61]Tolkien himself made use of the term ""trilogy"" for the work[T 15]though he did at other times consider this incorrect, as it was written and conceived as a single book.[T 16]It is often called a novel; however, Tolkien objected to this term as he viewed it as aheroic romance.[T 17]The books were published under a profit-sharing arrangement, whereby Tolkien would not receive an advance or royalties until the books had broken even, after which he would take a large share of the profits.[62]It has ultimately become one of the best-selling novels ever written, with at least 50 million copies sold by 2003[63]and over 150 million copies sold by 2007.[2]The work was published in the UK by Allen & Unwin until 1990, when the publisher and its assets were acquired byHarperCollins.[64][65]Editions and revisions[edit]Barbara Remington's cover illustrations for theBallantinepaperback version ""achieved mass-cult status"" on American college campuses in the 1960s.[20]They were parodied byMichael K. Frith's cover design for the 1969Bored of the Rings.[66][67]In the early 1960sDonald A. Wollheim, science fiction editor of the paperback publisherAce Books, claimed thatThe Lord of the Ringswas not protected in the United States underAmerican copyright lawbecause Houghton Mifflin, the US hardcover publisher, had neglected to copyright the work in the United States.[68][69]Then, in 1965, Ace Books proceeded to publish an edition, unauthorized by Tolkien and without payingroyaltiesto him. Tolkien took issue with this and quickly notified his fans of this objection.[70]Grass-rootspressure from these fans became so great that Ace Books withdrew their edition and made a nominal payment to Tolkien.[71][T 18]Authorized editions followed fromBallantine BooksandHoughton Mifflinto tremendous commercial success. Tolkien undertook various textual revisions to produce a version of the book that would be published with his consent and establish an unquestioned US copyright. This text became the Second Edition ofThe Lord of the Rings, published in 1965.[71]The first Ballantine paperback edition was printed in October that year, selling a quarter of a million copies within ten months. On 4 September 1966, the novel debuted onThe New York Times's Paperback Bestsellers list as number three, and was number one by 4 December, a position it held for eight weeks.[72]Houghton Mifflin editions after 1994 consolidate variant revisions by Tolkien, and corrections supervised byChristopher Tolkien, which resulted, after some initial glitches, in a computer-based unified text.[73]In 2004, for the 50th Anniversary Edition,Wayne G. HammondandChristina Scull, under supervision from Christopher Tolkien, studied and revised the text to eliminate as many errors and inconsistencies as possible, some of which had been introduced by well-meaning compositors of the first printing in 1954, and never been corrected.[74]The 2005 edition of the book contained further corrections noticed by the editors and submitted by readers. Yet more corrections were made in the 60th Anniversary Edition in 2014.[75]Several editions, including the 50th Anniversary Edition, print the whole work in one volume, with the result that pagination varies widely over the various editions.[T 19]Posthumous publication of drafts[edit]From 1988 to 1992 Christopher Tolkien published the surviving drafts ofThe Lord of the Rings, chronicling and illuminating with commentary the stages of the text's development, in volumes 6–9 of hisHistory of Middle-earthseries. The four volumes carry the titlesThe Return of the Shadow,The Treason of Isengard,The War of the Ring, andSauron Defeated.[76]Translations[edit]Further information:TranslatingThe Lord of the RingsSee also:List of translations ofThe Lord of the RingsThe work has been translated, with varying degrees of success, into at least 38,[d]and reportedly at least 70, languages.[77]Tolkien, an expert inphilology, examined many of these translations, and made comments on each that reflect both the translation process and his work. As he was unhappy with some choices made by early translators, such as theSwedish translationbyÅke Ohlmarks,[T 20]Tolkien wrote a ""Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings"" (1967). BecauseThe Lord of the Ringspurports to be a translation of the fictitiousRed Book of Westmarch, using the English language to represent theWestronof the ""original"", Tolkien suggested that translators attempt to capture the interplay between English and the invented nomenclature of the English work, and gave several examples along with general guidance.[78][79]Reception[edit]Main article:Literary reception ofThe Lord of the Rings1950s[edit]Earlyreviews of the work were mixed. The initial review in theSunday Telegraphdescribed it as ""among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century"".[80]TheSunday Timesechoed this sentiment, stating that ""the English-speaking world is divided into those who have readThe Lord of the RingsandThe Hobbitand those who are going to read them.""[80]TheNew York Herald Tribuneappeared to predict the books' popularity, writing in its review that they were ""destined to outlast our time"".[81]W. H. Auden, a former pupil of Tolkien's and an admirer of his writings, regardedThe Lord of the Ringsas a ""masterpiece"", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement ofJohn Milton'sParadise Lost.[82]Kenneth F. Slater wrote inNebula Science Fiction, April 1955, ""... if you don't read it, you have missed one of the finest books of its type ever to appear"".[83][84]On the other hand, in 1955, the Scottish poetEdwin MuirattackedThe Return of the King, writing that ""All the characters are boys masquerading as adult heroes ... and will never come to puberty ... Hardly one of them knows anything about women"", causing Tolkien to complain angrily to his publisher.[85]In 1956, theliterary criticEdmund Wilsonwrote a review entitled ""Oo, Those Awful Orcs!"", calling Tolkien's work ""juvenile trash"", and saying ""Dr. Tolkien has little skill at narrative and no instinct for literary form.""[86]Within Tolkien's literary group,The Inklings, the work had a mixed reception.Hugo Dysoncomplained loudly at its readings,[87][g]whereasC. S. Lewishad very different feelings, writing, ""here are beauties which pierce like swords or burn like cold iron. Here is a book which will break your heart.""[9]Lewis observed that the writing is rich, in that some of the 'good' characters have darker sides, and likewise some of the villains have ""good impulses"".[88]Despite the mixed reviews and the lack of a paperback until the 1960s,The Lord of the Ringsinitially sold well in hardback.[9]Later[edit]Further information:Tolkien's prose styleandLiterary hostility to J. R. R. TolkienJudith Shulevitz, writing inThe New York Times, criticized the ""pedantry"" ofTolkien's literary style, saying that he ""formulated a high-minded belief in the importance of his mission as a literary preservationist, which turns out to be death to literature itself"".[89]The critic Richard Jenkyns, writing inThe New Republic, criticized the work for a lack of psychological depth. Both the characters and the work itself were, according to Jenkyns, ""anemic, and lacking in fibre"".[90]The science fiction authorDavid Brininterprets the work as holding unquestioning devotion to a traditional hierarchical social structure.[91]In his essay ""Epic Pooh"", fantasy authorMichael Moorcockcritiques the world-view displayed by the book as deeply conservative, in both the ""paternalism"" of the narrative voice and thepower structuresin the narrative.[92]Tom Shippey, like Tolkien an English philologist, notes the wide gulf between Tolkien's supporters, both popular and academic, and his literary detractors, and attempts to explain in detail both why the literary establishment dislikedThe Lord of the Rings, and the work's subtlety, themes, and merits, including theimpression of depththat it conveys.[13]The scholar of humanitiesBrian Roseburyanalysed Tolkien's prose style in detail, showing that it was generally quite plain, varying to suit the voices of the different characters, and rising to a heroic register for special moments.[93]The criticPatrick Currycited the work's first publisher,Rayner Unwin's ""pithy and accurate"" assessment of the novel: ""a very great book in its own curious way"".[94]Awards[edit]In 1957,The Lord of the Ringswas awarded theInternational Fantasy Award. Despite its numerous detractors, the publication of theAce BooksandBallantinepaperbacks helpedThe Lord of the Ringsbecome immensely popular in the United States in the 1960s. The book has remained so ever since, ranking as the most popular works of fiction of the twentieth century, judged by all of three different measures: sales, library borrowings, and reader surveys.[95][96]In the 2003 ""Big Read"" survey conducted in Britain by the BBC,The Lord of the Ringswas found to be the ""Nation's best-loved book"". In similar 2004 polls both Germany[97]and Australia[98]choseThe Lord of the Ringsas their favourite book. In a 1999 poll ofAmazon.comcustomers,The Lord of the Ringswas judged to be their favourite ""book of the millennium"".[99]In 2019, theBBC NewslistedThe Lord of the Ringson itslist of the ""100 most inspiring novels"".[100]Adaptations[edit]Main article:Adaptations ofThe Lord of the RingsThe Lord of the Ringshas been adapted into various media, including radio, stage, motion pictures, and videogames.Radio[edit]The book has been adapted for radio four times. In 1955 and 1956, theBBCbroadcastThe Lord of the Rings, a 13-part radio adaptation of the story. In the 1960s radio stationWBAIproduced a shortradio adaptation. A 1979 dramatization ofThe Lord of the Ringswas broadcast in the United States and subsequently issued on tape and CD. In 1981, the BBC broadcastThe Lord of the Rings, a new dramatization in 26 half-hour instalments.[101][102]Motion pictures[edit]Main articles:Middle-earth in motion picturesandPeter Jackson's interpretation ofThe Lord of the RingsA variety of filmmakers considered adapting Tolkien's book, among themStanley Kubrick, who thought itunfilmable,[103][104]Michelangelo Antonioni,[105]Jim Henson,[106]Heinz Edelmann,[107]andJohn Boorman.[108]A Swedish live action television film,Sagan om ringen, was broadcast in 1971.[109]In 1978,Ralph Bakshimade an animatedfilm versioncoveringThe Fellowship of the Ringand part ofThe Two Towers, to mixed reviews.[110]In 1980,Rankin/Bassreleasedan animated TV specialbased on the closing chapters ofThe Return of the King, gaining mixed reviews.[111][112]The 1991 Soviet Union live-action adaptation ofThe Fellowship of the Ring,Khraniteli, was aired once and thought lost,[113][114]but was rediscovered and republished on the Web. It includesTom Bombadiland theBarrow-wight, omitted from Jackson's version.[115]In Finland, a live action television miniseries,Hobitit, was broadcast in 1993 based onThe Lord of the Rings, with a flashback to Bilbo's encounter with Gollum inThe Hobbit.[116][117]A far more successful adaptation wasPeter Jackson's live actionThe Lord of the Ringsfilm trilogy, produced byNew Line Cinemaand released in three instalments asThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring(2001),The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers(2002), andThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King(2003). All three parts won multipleAcademy Awards, including consecutiveBest Picturenominations. The final instalment of this trilogy was the second film to break the one-billion-dollar barrier and won a total of 11Oscars(something only two other films in history,Ben-HurandTitanic, have accomplished), includingBest Picture,Best DirectorandBest Adapted Screenplay.[118][119]Commentators including Tolkien scholars, literary critics and film critics are divided onhow faithfully Jackson adapted Tolkien's work, or whether a film version is inevitably different, and if so the reasons for any changes, and the effectiveness of the result.[120]The Hunt for Gollum, a 2009 film byChris Bouchard,[121][122]and the 2009Born of Hope, written by Paula DiSante and directed byKate Madison, arefan filmsbased on details in the appendices ofThe Lord of the Rings.[123]From September 2022,Amazonhas been presenting a multi-season television series of stories,The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. It is set at the beginning of theSecond Age, long before the time ofThe Lord of the Rings, based on materials in the novel's appendices.[124][125][126]In 2023,Warner Bros. Discoverybegan making a series of films set in Middle-earth, produced along withNew Line Cinemaand Freemode.[127]The first wasThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, ananimewritten by Jeffrey Addiss, Will Matthews andPhilippa Boyens, directed byKenji Kamiyamaand released in December 2024. It was based on the story of the legendary Rohan kingHelm Hammerhand.[128][129][130]Audiobooks[edit]In 1990,Recorded Bookspublished anaudio versionofThe Lord of the Rings,[131]read by the British actorRob Inglis. A large-scale musical theatre adaptation,The Lord of the Rings, was first staged inToronto, Ontario, Canadain 2006 and opened in London in June 2007; it was a commercial failure.[132]In 2013, the artist Phil Dragash recorded the whole of the book, using the score from Peter Jackson's movies.[133][134][135]During theCOVID-19 lockdown,Andy Serkisread the entire book ofThe Hobbitonline to raise money for charity.[136]He then recorded the work again as an audiobook.[137]The cover art was done byAlan Lee. In 2021, Serkis recordedThe Lord of the Ringsnovels.[138]Legacy[edit]Further information:Works inspired by J. R. R. TolkienInfluence on fantasy[edit]Main article:Tolkien's impact on fantasyThe enormous popularity of Tolkien's work expanded the demand for fantasy. Largely thanks toThe Lord of the Rings, the genre flowered throughout the 1960s and enjoys popularity to the present day.[139]The opus has spawned many imitations, such asThe Sword of Shannara, whichLin Cartercalled ""the single most cold-blooded, complete rip-off of another book that I have ever read,""[140]as well as alternate interpretations of the story, such asThe Last Ringbearer.The Legend of Zelda, which popularized theaction-adventure gamegenre in the 1980s, was inspired byThe Lord of the Ringsamong other fantasy books.[141][142]Dungeons & Dragons, which popularized therole-playing gamegenre in the 1970s, features several races fromThe Lord of the Rings,includinghalflings(hobbits), elves, dwarves,half-elves, orcs, and dragons. However,Gary Gygax, the lead designer of the game, stated that he included these elements as a marketing move to draw on the popularity the work enjoyed at the time he was developing the game.[143]Because Dungeons & Dragons has gone on toinfluence many popular games, especiallyrole-playing video games, the influence ofThe Lord of the Ringsextends to many of them, with titles such asDragon Quest,[144][145]EverQuest, theWarcraftseries, andThe Elder Scrollsseries of games[146]as well asvideo games set in Middle-earthitself.Music[edit]Further information:Music of Middle-earthIn 1965, the composer and songwriterDonald Swann, best known for his collaboration withMichael FlandersasFlanders & Swann, set six poems fromThe Lord of the Ringsand one fromThe Adventures of Tom Bombadil(""Errantry"") to music. When Swann met with Tolkien to play the songs for his approval, Tolkien suggested for ""Namárië"" (Galadriel's lament) a setting reminiscent ofplain chant, which Swann accepted.[147]The songs were published in 1967 asThe Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle,[148]and a recording of the songs performed by singer William Elvin with Swann on piano was issued that same year byCaedmon RecordsasPoems and Songs of Middle Earth.[149]Rock bands of the 1970s were musically and lyrically inspired by the fantasy-embracing counter-culture of the time. The British rock bandLed Zeppelinrecorded several songs that contain explicit references toThe Lord of the Rings, such as mentioning Gollum and Mordor in ""Ramble On"", theMisty Mountainsin ""Misty Mountain Hop"", and Ringwraiths in ""The Battle of Evermore"". In 1970, the Swedish musicianBo Hanssonreleased aninstrumentalconcept albumentitledSagan om ringen(""The Saga of the Ring"", the title of the Swedish translation at the time).[150]The album was subsequently released internationally asMusic Inspired by Lord of the Ringsin 1972.[150]From the 1980s onwards, many heavy metal acts have been influenced by Tolkien.[151]In 1988, the Dutch composer and trombonistJohan de Meijcompleted hisSymphony No. 1 ""The Lord of the Rings"". It had 5 movements, titled ""Gandalf"", ""Lothlórien"", ""Gollum"", ""Journey in the Dark"", and ""Hobbits"".[152]The 1991 albumShepherd Moonsby the Irish musicianEnyacontains an instrumental titled ""Lothlórien"", in reference to the home of the wood-elves.[153]Impact on popular culture[edit]Further information:Impact of Tolkien's mythology""Welcome to Hobbiton"" sign inMatamata, New Zealand, wherePeter Jackson's film version was shotThe Lord of the Ringshas had a profound and wide-ranging impact on popular culture, beginning with its publication in the 1950s, but especially during the 1960s and 1970s, when young people embraced it as acounterculturalsaga.[154]""Frodo Lives!"" and ""Gandalf for President"" were two phrases popular among United StatesTolkien fansduring this time.[155]Its impact is such that the words ""Tolkienian"" and ""Tolkienesque"" have entered theOxford English Dictionary, and many of his fantasy terms, formerly little-known in English, such as ""Orc"" and ""Warg"", have become widespread in that domain.[156]Among its effects are numerousparodies, especiallyHarvard Lampoon'sBored of the Rings, which has had the distinction of remaining continuously in print from its publication in 1969, and of being translated into at least 11 languages.[157]In 1969, Tolkien sold the merchandising rights toThe Lord of The RingsandThe HobbittoUnited Artistsunder an agreement stipulating a lump sum payment of £10,000[158](equivalent to £208,000 in 2023) plus a 7.5% royalty after costs,[159]payable to Allen & Unwin and the author.[160]In 1976, three years after the author's death, United Artists sold the rights toSaul ZaentzCompany, who now trade asTolkien Enterprises. Since then all ""authorised"" merchandise has been signed off by Tolkien Enterprises, although theintellectual property rightsof the specific likenesses of characters and other imagery from various adaptations is generally held by the adaptors.[161]Outside commercial exploitation from adaptations, from the late 1960s onwards there has been an increasing variety of original licensed merchandise, with posters and calendars created by illustrators such asBarbara Remington.[162]The work was named Britain's best novel of all time in the BBC'sThe Big Read.[163]In 2015, the BBC rankedThe Lord of the Rings26th on its list of the 100 greatest British novels.[164]It was included inLe Monde's list of ""100 Books of the Century"".[165]Notes[edit]^J. R. R. Tolkiendisliked having the word ""novel"" applied to his works, preferring the phrase ""heroicromance"", but ""novel"" is commonly applied.[T 1]^Tolkien has the wizard Gandalf say to the hobbit Frodo ""the Black Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings.""[T 2]^Volume I:Prologue,The Ring Sets Out,The Ring Goes South;Volume II:The Treason of Isengard,The Ring Goes East;Volume III:The War of the Ring,The End of the Third Age, Appendices A–F.^abAt least 38 languages are listed at theFAQ. This number is a very conservative estimate; some 56 translations are listed attranslations ofThe Lord of the Rings, and 57 languages  are listed atElrond's Library.^Tolkien created the word to define a different view of myth from C. S. Lewis's ""lies breathed through silver"", writing the poem ""Mythopoeia"" to present his argument; it was first published inTree and Leafin 1988.[10]^See the lead images in the articles on the three separate volumes, e.g.The Fellowship of the Ring.^Dyson's actual comment,bowdlerizedin the TV version, was ""Not another fucking Elf!""Grovier, Kelly (29 April 2007).""In the Name of the Father"".The Observer.Archivedfrom the original on 2 October 2013.

She writes letters to God because her father Alphonso beats and rapes her. Due to the rape, she gives birth to two children, Olivia and Adam, whom Alphonso takes away. A farmer identified as ""Mister"" (Mr.__) asks to marry her younger sister Nettie, but Alphonso offers him Celie instead. Celie is abused by Mister and mistreated by his prior children. Nettie runs away and stays with Celie, but Mister eventually makes her leave after she refuses his unwanted sexual advances. Nettie promises to write, but Celie never receives any letters, and Celie concludes that she is dead.Mister's son Harpo marries an assertive girl named Sofia. Celie is impressed by Sofia's self-esteem, but Mister chides Harpo for what he considers weakness in his treatment of Sofia. In a moment of envy, Celie tells Harpo to beat Sofia. Sofia fights back and confronts Celie, who apologizes and confides in her about Mister's abuse.Shug Avery, ajazzandbluessinger and Mister's long-time mistress, moves in. Celie takes care of Shug, who is ill. While Shug is initially rude to Celie, the two become friends and Celie becomes infatuated with Shug. Frustrated by Harpo's domineering behavior, Sofia moves out, taking her children with her. Several months later, Harpo opens ajuke jointwhere a fully recovered Shug performs nightly. Shug begins an affair with Mister. Shug learns that Mister beats Celie, and vows to stay at the house until she is convinced he will stop. Shug and Celie grow closer, and Celie tells Shug that she's never had an orgasm. Shug convinces Celia to look at hervulvain a mirror and teaches her about herclitoris.Sofia returns for a visit and gets into a fight with Harpo's new girlfriend, Squeak (Mary Agnes). She has a verbal spat with the mayor's wife, Miss Millie, and after the mayor slaps her, she hits him back. She is beaten by the police and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Squeak tricks the warden, her white uncle, into releasing Sofia from prison and having her work as Miss Millie's maid. The plan works, but the warden rapes Squeak. Sofia is released from prison and forced to work for Miss Millie, which she detests. Squeak cares for Sofia's children, and the two women become friends.Shug returns to town, newly married to a man called Grady. Celie confesses to Shug that her father raped her. While both their husbands are out, Celie and Shug have sex for the first time. Together, they learn that Mister has hidden letters from Nettie for years. In the letters, Nettie says she has befriended a missionary couple, Samuel and Corrine, and gone to Africa with them. Samuel and Corrine had unwittingly adopted Adam and Olivia. Through Samuel's story of the adoption, Nettie learns that Alphonso is her and Celie's stepfather. Their biological father was lynched, and their mother then suffered a mental collapse that Alphonso exploited. Nettie confesses to Samuel and Corrine that she is the children's biological aunt. Corrine, gravely ill, refuses to believe Nettie until Nettie reminds her that she had previously met Celie. Later, Corrine dies, having accepted Nettie's story.Celie visits Alphonso, who confirms Nettie's story. Celie confides to Shug that she is losing faith in God; Shug explains to Celie her own unique religious philosophy.

Celie learns that Mister is suffering from a considerable decline in fortunes, and begins calling him by his first name, Albert. Mister proposes that they marry ""in the spirit as well as in the flesh"", but Celie declines.Nettie and Samuel marry and prepare to return to America. Before they leave, Adam marries Tashi, an African girl. Following tradition, Tashi undergoesfemale genital mutilationandfacial scarring. In solidarity, Adam undergoes the same facial scarring ritual.As Celie realizes that she is content without Shug, Shug returns, having ended her relationship with Germaine.

The title echoes the component parts ofGeoffrey Chaucer'sThe Canterbury Tales, which is a series of connected stories (such as ""The Merchant's Tale"" and ""The Parson's Tale"").[9]It also alludes to the tradition of fairy tales where the central character tells her story.[10]The Handmaid's Talewon the 1985Governor General's Awardand the firstArthur C. Clarke Awardin 1987; it was also nominated for the 1986Nebula Award, the 1986Booker Prize, and the 1987Prometheus Award. In 2022,The Handmaid's Talewas included on the ""Big Jubilee Read"" list of 70 books byCommonwealthauthors, selected to celebrate thePlatinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.[11]The book has been adapted into a1990 film, a2000 opera,a 2017 television series, and other media. A sequel novel,The Testaments, was published in 2019.Plot summary[edit]After staging an attack killing thepresident of the United Statesand most ofCongress, a radical political group called the ""Sons ofJacob"" usestheonomicideology to launch a revolution.[8]TheConstitutionis suspended, newspapers arecensored, and theUnited States of Americais reformed into amilitary dictatorshipknown as the Republic of Gilead. The new regime quickly consolidates its power, overtaking all other religious groups, includingChristiandenominations.The regime reorganizes society using a peculiar interpretation of someOld Testamentideas, and a new militarized, hierarchical model of social and religious theonomy is established among its newsocial classes. One of the most significant changes is the limitation ofwomen's rights. Women become the lowest-ranking class and are not allowed to own money or property, or to read and write. Women are deprived of control over their reproductive functions. Though the regime controls most of the country, various rebel groups remain active.The story is told in the first-person by a woman named Offred, considered acriminalfor trying toescapetoCanadawith a forgedpassportwith her husband and five-year-old daughter; she is also considered an adulterer for being married to a divorced man. Her marriage was forcibly dissolved, and her daughter was taken from her. Instead of being sentenced under the Republic of Gilead's draconiancriminal justice system, Offred accepted training to become a ""Handmaid"" at theRachelandLeahCentre, an alternative only available to fertile women:environmental pollutionandradiationhave drastically affectedfertility, and she is one of the few remaining women who can conceive. She has been assigned to produce children for the ""Commanders"", the ruling class of men, and is made a Handmaid, a role based on thebiblicalstory ofRacheland her handmaidBilhah.Women are classed socially and wear uniforms, ranked highest to lowest: the Commanders' Wives in sky blue, their unmarried daughters in white, the Handmaids in red with highly visible large whitebonnets, the Aunts (who train andindoctrinatethe Handmaids) in brown, the Marthas (cooks and maids, possibly unmarriedsterilewomenpast child-bearing years) in green, Econowives (the wives of lower-ranking men who handle everything in thedomestic sphere) in blue, red and green stripes, and widows in black.Offred details her life starting with her third assignment as a Handmaid to a Commander. Interspersing narratives of her present-day experiences are flashbacks of her life before and during the beginning of the revolution, including her failed escape, indoctrination by the Aunts, and her friend Moira's escape from the indoctrination facility. At her new home, she is treated poorly by the Commander's wife, Serena Joy, a formerChristian mediapersonality who supported women's domesticity and subordinate role well before Gilead was established.To Offred's surprise, the Commander asks to see her outside of the ""Ceremony"", ritualized rape conducted during the Handmaids' likely fertile period each month, with the wives present, intended to result inconception. His request to see her in the library is illegal in Gilead, but they meet nevertheless. They mostly playScrabbleand Offred is allowed to ask favors of him, such as information or material items. He asks Offred to kiss him ""as if she meant it"" and tells her about his strained relationship with his wife. Finally, he gives her lingerie and takes her to a covert, government-runbrothelusingJezebels, women forced into sanctioned sex slavery. Offred unexpectedly encounters an emotionally-broken Moira there, who tells her that those found breaking the law are sent to the ""Colonies"" to clean uptoxic wasteor are allowed to work as Jezebels as punishment.In the days between her visits to the Commander, Offred also learns her shopping partner, a woman called Ofglen, is with the Maydayresistance, an underground network working to overthrow Gilead's government. Not knowing of Offred's criminal acts with her husband, Serena begins to suspect that he is infertile, so she arranges for Offred to have sex with Nick, the Commander's personal servant, who had attempted to talk to her before and shown interest. Serena offers Offred information about her daughter in exchange. She later brings her a photograph of Offred's daughter which leaves Offred feeling dejected believing she has been erased from her daughter's life.After their initial sexual encounter, Offred and Nick begin to meet on their own initiative as well; she discovers that she enjoys these intimate moments despite memories of her husband, and shares potentially dangerous information about her past with him. Offred later tells Nick that she thinks she is pregnant.Offred hears from a new walking partner that Ofglen has disappeared (reported as a suicide). Shecontemplates suicidewhen Serena finds evidence of the illegal relationship with the Commander. Shortly afterward, men arrive at the house wearing uniforms of thesecret police, known as the Eyes of God or simply ""Eyes"", to take her away. As she is led to a waiting van, Nick tells her to trust him and go with the men. Offred is unsure if Nick or the men are Eyes or secretly members of Mayday, or if they are here to capture her or aid in her escape; she ultimately enters the van. Her future is left uncertain while Serena and the Commander are left bereft in their house, each thinking about the repercussions of Offred's capture on their lives.The novel concludes with ametafictionalepilogue, described as a partial transcript of an international historical association conference taking place in the year 2195. The male keynote speaker explains that Offred's narrative was originally recorded on a set of audio cassettes, a technology roughly 200 years out of date at that time, and later transcribed by historians. The speaker appears to be very dismissive of the misogyny of Gilead and interprets the story's title as a sexist joke. He also comments on the difficulty of authenticating the account, due to how few records have survived from the early years of Gilead's existence, and speculates on the eventual fates of Offred and her acquaintances.[12]Background[edit]Fitting with her statements thatThe Handmaid's Taleis a work ofspeculative fiction, notscience fiction, Atwood's novel offers asatiricalview of various social, political, and religious trends of early Puritanism in the United States. Atwood notes that ""[n]ations never build apparently radical forms of government on foundations that aren’t there already,"" and further describes the novel's setting as a potential cover story forhowsomeone might seize power in the United States.Such a situation, argues Atwood, would ""need only the opportunity of a period of social chaos to reassert itself.""[13]Atwood argues that all of the scenarios offered inThe Handmaid's Talehave actually occurred in real life—in an interview she gave regarding her later novelOryx and Crake, Atwood maintains that ""As withThe Handmaid's Tale, I didn't put in anything that we haven't already done, we're not already doing, we're seriously trying to do, coupled with trends that are already in progress... So all of those things are real, and therefore the amount of pure invention is close to nil.""[14]Atwood was known to carry aroundnewspaperclippings to her various interviews to support her fiction's basis in reality.[15]Atwood has explained thatThe Handmaid's Taleis a response to those who say the oppressive, totalitarian, and religious governments that have taken hold in other countries throughout the years ""can't happen here""—but in this work, she has tried to show how such a takeover might play out.[16]Atwood was also inspired by theIslamic revolution in Iranin 1978–79 that saw a theocracy established that drastically reduced therights of womenandimposeda strict dress code onIranian women, very much like that of Gilead.[17]InThe Handmaid's Tale, a reference is made to theIslamic Republic of Iranin the form of the history bookIran and Gilead: Two Late Twentieth Century Monotheocraciesmentioned in the endnotes describing the historians' convention in 2195.[17]Atwood's picture of a society ruled by men who professed high moral principles, but are in fact self-interested and selfish was inspired by observingCanadian politiciansin action, especially in her hometown ofToronto, who frequently profess in a very sanctimonious manner to be acting from the highest principles of morality while in reality the opposite is the case.[17]During theSecond World War,Canadian womentook on jobs in the place of men serving in the military that they were expected to yield to men once the war was over. After 1945, not all women wanted to return to their traditional roles ashousewivesand mothers, leading to a male backlash.[18]Atwood was born in 1939, and while growing up in the 1950s she saw first-hand the complaints against women who continued to work after 1945 and of women who unhappily gave up their jobs, which she incorporated into her novel.[18]The way in which the narrator is forced into becoming an unhappy housewife after she loses her job, in common with all the other women of Gilead, was inspired by Atwood's memories of the 1950s.[18]Atwood's inspiration for the Republic of Gilead came from her study of earlyAmerican Puritanswhile at Harvard, which she attended on aWoodrow Wilson Fellowship.[19]Atwood argues that the modern view of the Puritans—that they came to America to fleereligious persecutionin England and set up areligiously tolerantsociety—is misleading, and that instead, these Puritan leaders wanted to establish a monolithictheonomywhere religious dissent would not be tolerated.[19][20]Atwood has a personal connection to the Puritans, and she dedicates the novel to her own ancestorMary Webster, who wasaccused of witchcraftin Puritan New England but survived her hanging.[21]Due to the totalitarian nature of Gileadean society, Atwood, in creating the setting, drew from the ""utopian idealism"" present in 20th-century régimes, such asCambodiaandRomania, as well as earlier New England Puritanism.[22]Atwood has argued that a coup, such as the one depicted inThe Handmaid's Tale, would misuse religion in order to achieve its own ends.[22][23]Atwood, in regards to those leading Gilead, further stated:[24]I don't consider these people to be Christians because they do not have at the core of their behaviour and ideologies what I, in my feeble Canadian way, would consider to be the core of Christianity ... and that would be not only love your neighbours but love your enemies. That would also be ""I was sick and you visited me not"" and such and such ...And that would include also concern for the environment, because you can't love your neighbour or even your enemy, unless you love your neighbour's oxygen, food, and water. You can't love your neighbour or your enemy if you're presuming policies that are going to cause those people to die. ... Of course faith can be a force for good and often has been. So faith is a force for good particularly when people are feeling beleaguered and in need of hope. So you can have bad iterations and you can also have the iteration in which people have got too much power and then start abusing it. But that is human behaviour, so you can't lay it down to religion. You can find the same in any power situation, such as politics or ideologies that purport to beatheist. Need I mention the formerSoviet Union? So it is not a question of religion making people behave badly. It is a question of human beings getting power and then wanting more of it.In the same vein, Atwood also declared that ""In the real world today, some religious groups are leading movements for the protection of vulnerable groups, including women.""[9]Atwood draws connections between the ways in which Gilead's leaders maintain their power and other examples of actualtotalitarian governments. In her interviews, Atwood offers upAfghanistanas an example of a religious theocracy forcingwomenout of the public sphere and into their homes,[25]as in Gilead.[15][19]The ""state-sanctioned murder of dissidents"" was inspired by thePhilippines under President Ferdinand Marcos, and the lastGeneral Secretary of the Romanian Communist PartyNicolae Ceaușescu's obsession with increasing the birth rate (Decree 770) led to the strict policing of pregnant women and the outlawing of birth control andabortion.[15]However, Atwood clearly explains that many of these actions were not just present in other cultures and countries, ""but withinWestern society, and within the 'Christian' tradition itself"".[22]The Republic of Gilead struggles withinfertility, making Offred's services as a Handmaid vital to producing children and thus reproducing the society. Handmaids themselves are ""untouchable"", but their ability to signify status is equated to that of slaves or servants throughout history.[22]Atwood connects their concerns with infertility to real-life problems our world faces, such as radiation, chemical pollution, andsexually transmitted disease(HIV/AIDSis specifically mentioned in the ""Historical Notes"" section at the end of the novel, which was a relatively new disease at the time of Atwood's writing whose long-term impact was still unknown). Atwood's strong stance on environmental issues and their negative consequences for our society has presented itself in other works such as herMaddAddamtrilogy, and refers back to her growing up with biologists and her own scientific curiosity.[26]Characters[edit]Offred[edit]Offred is theprotagonistandnarratorwho takes the readers through life in Gilead. She was labelled a ""wanton woman"" when Gilead was established because she had married a man who was divorced. All divorces were nullified by the new government, meaning her husband was now considered still married to his first wife, making Offred an adulteress. In trying to escape Gilead, she was separated from her husband and daughter.[27]She is part of the first generation of Gilead's women, those who remember pre-Gilead times. Proved fertile, she is considered an important commodity and has been placed as a ""Handmaid"" in the home of ""the Commander"" and his wife Serena Joy, to bear a child for them (Serena Joy is believed to be infertile).[27]Readers are able to see Offred's resistance to the Republic of Gilead on the inside through her thoughts.Sometimes Offred has thoughts most readers would disagree with, such as the Ceremony not being rape because she agreed to be a Handmaid, despite the implication that she had no real choice (the alternative may have been execution, orhard labourcleaning nuclear waste). This may be a belief she has adapted tolessen her mental strain, or may be due to brainwashing during her Handmaid training.Offred is aslave namethat describes her function: she is ""of Fred"" (i.e., she belongs to Fred – presumed to be the name of the Commander – and is considered aconcubine). In the novel, Offred says that she isnota concubine, but a tool; a ""two-legged womb"". The Handmaids' names say nothing about who the women really are; their only identity is as the Commander's property. ""Offred"" is also a pun on the word ""offered"", as in ""offered as a sacrifice"", and ""of red"" because the red dress assigned for the Handmaids in Gilead.[9]In Atwood's original novel, Offred's real name is never revealed. InVolker Schlöndorff's 1990 film adaptation Offred was given the real name Kate,[28]while the television series gave her the real name June.The women in training to be Handmaids whisper names across their beds at night. The names are ""Alma. Janine. Dolores. Moira. June"", and all are later accounted for except June. In addition, one of the Aunts tells the Handmaids-in-training to stop ""mooning and June-ing"".[29]From this and other references, some readers have inferred that her birth name could be ""June"".[30]Academic Madonne Miner suggests that ""June"" is a pseudonym. As ""Mayday"" is the name of the Gilead resistance, June could be an invention by the protagonist. The Nunavut conference covered in the epilogue takes place in June.[31]When the Hulu TV series chose to state outright that Offred's real name is June, Atwood wrote that it was not her original intention to imply that Offred's real name is June ""but it fits, so readers are welcome to it if they wish"".[9]The revelation of Offred's real name serves only to humanize her in the presence of the other Handmaids.Commander[edit]The Commander says that he was a scientist and was previously involved in something similar tomarket researchbefore Gilead's inception. Later, it is hypothesized, but not confirmed, that he might have been one of the architects of the Republic and its laws. Presumably, his first name is ""Fred"", though that, too, may be a pseudonym. He engages inforbidden intellectual pursuitswith Offred, such as playingScrabble, and introduces her to a secret club that serves as a brothel for high-ranking officers.He shows his softer side to Offred during their covert meetings and confesses to being ""misunderstood"" by his wife. Offred learns that the Commander carried on a similar relationship with his previous Handmaid, who later killed herself when his wife found out.In the epilogue, Professor Pieixoto speculates that one of two figures, both instrumental in the establishment of Gilead, may have been the Commander, based on the name ""Fred"". It is his belief that the Commander was a man named Frederick R. Waterford who was killed in apurgeshortly after Offred was taken away, charged with harbouring an enemy agent.Serena Joy[edit]Serena Joy is a formertelevangelistand the Commander's Wife in the fundamentalist theonomy. Her real name is Pam and she is fond of gardening and knitting. The state took away her power and public recognition, and she tries to hide her past as a television figure. Offred identifies Serena Joy by recalling seeing her on TV when she was a little girl early on Saturday mornings while waiting for the cartoons to air.Believed to be sterile (although the suggestion is made that the Commander is sterile, Gileadean laws attribute sterility only to women), she is forced to accept that he has use of a Handmaid. She resents having to take part in ""The Ceremony"", a monthly ritual where the ""owner"" Commander attempts to impregnate the enslaved Handmaid while she is ovulating. Serena strikes a deal with Offred to arrange for her to have sex with Nick in order to become pregnant. According to Professor Pieixoto in the epilogue, ""Serena Joy"" or ""Pam"" are pseudonyms. The character's real name is implied to be Thelma.Ofglen[edit]Ofglen is a neighbour of Offred's and a fellow Handmaid. She is partnered with Offred to do the daily shopping. Handmaids are never alone and are expected to police each other's behaviour. Ofglen is a secret member of the Mayday resistance. In contrast to Offred, she is daring. She knocks out a Mayday spy who is to betorturedandkilledin order to save him the pain of a violent death. Offred is told that when Ofglen vanishes, it is because she has committed suicide before the government can take her into custody due to her membership in the resistance, possibly to avoid giving away any information.A new Handmaid, also called Ofglen, takes Ofglen's place, and is assigned as Offred's shopping partner. She threatens Offred against any thought of resistance. However, she breaks protocol by telling her what happened to the previous Ofglen.Nick[edit]Nick is the Commander'schauffeur, who lives above the garage. Right from the start, Nick comes across as a daring character as he smokes and tries to engage with Offred, both forbidden activities. By Serena Joy's arrangement, he and Offred start a sexual relationship to increase her chance of getting pregnant. If she were unable to bear the Commander a child, she would be declared sterile and shipped to the ecological wastelands of the Colonies. Offred begins to develop feelings for him. Nick is an ambiguous character, and Offred does not know if he is a party loyalist or part of the resistance, though he identifies himself as the latter. The epilogue suggests that he really was part of the resistance, and aided Offred in escaping the Commander's house.Moira[edit]Moira has been a close friend of Offred's since college. In the novel, their relationship represents a female friendship that the Republic of Gilead tries to block. A lesbian, she has resisted thehomophobiaof Gileadean society. Moira is taken to be a Handmaid soon after Offred. She finds the life of a Handmaid unbearably oppressive and risks engaging with the guards just to defy the system. She escapes by stealing an Aunt's pass and clothes, but Offred later finds her working as a sex slave in a party-run brothel. She was caught and chose the brothel rather than to be sent to the Colonies. Moira exemplifies defiance against Gilead by rejecting every value that is forced onto the citizens.Luke[edit]Luke was Offred's husband before the formation of Gilead. He was married when he first started a relationship with Offred and divorced his first wife to marry her. Under Gilead, all divorces were retroactively nullified, resulting in Offred being considered an adulteress and their daughterillegitimate. Offred was forced to become a Handmaid and her daughter was given to a loyalist family. Since their attempt to escape to Canada, Offred has heard nothing of Luke. She wavers between believing him dead or imprisoned.Professor Pieixoto[edit]Pieixoto is the ""co-discoverer [with Professor Knotly Wade] of Offred's tapes"". In his presentation at an academic conference set in 2195, he talks about ""the 'Problems of Authentication in Reference toThe Handmaid's Tale'"".[27]Pieixoto is the person who is retelling Offred's story, and so makes the narration even moreunreliablethan it was originally.Aunt Lydia[edit]Aunt Lydia appears in flashbacks where her instructions frequently haunt Offred. Aunt Lydia works at the 'Red Center' where women receive instructions for a life as a Handmaid. Throughout the narrative, Aunt Lydia's pithy pronouncements on the code of conduct for the Handmaids shed light on the philosophy of subjugation of women practised in Gilead. Aunt Lydia appears to be a true believer of Gilead's religious philosophy and seems to take her job as a genuine calling.In the sequelThe Testaments, however, Aunt Lydia is revealed to have been aiding anti-Gilead resistance networks. Her actions in releasing internal information to selected contacts instigates an internal purge that demolishes Gilead's ability to function and restores the United States. She also writes an autobiography of her life, which she hides in a copy ofCardinal John Henry Newman'sApologia Pro Vita Suain the restricted section of the Ardua Hall library.Cora[edit]A Martha (female domestic servants are called Marthas) who works at the Commander's house because she is infertile. She hopes that Offred will get pregnant as she desires to help raise a child. She is friendly towards Offred and even covers up for her when she finds her lying on the floor one morning—a suspicious occurrence by Gilead's standards, worthy of being reported.Rita[edit]Rita is a Martha at the Commander's house. Her job is cooking and housekeeping and she is one of the members of the ""household"". At the start of the novel, Rita has a contempt for Offred and though she is responsible for keeping Offred well fed, she believes a Handmaid should prefer going to the Colonies over working as a sexual slave.Setting[edit]The novel is set in an indeterminate dystopian future, speculated to be around the year 2005,[32]with a fundamentalist theonomy ruling the territory of what had been the United States but is now the Republic of Gilead. The fertility rates in Gilead have diminished due to environmental toxicity and fertile women are a valuable commodity owned and enslaved by the powerful elite. Individuals are segregated by categories and dressed according to their social functions. Complex dress codes play a key role in imposing social control within the new society and serve to distinguish people by sex, occupation, andcaste.The action takes place in what once was theHarvard Squareneighbourhood ofCambridge, Massachusetts;[33][34]Atwood studied atRadcliffe College, located in this area. As a researcher, Atwood spent a lot of time in theWidener Libraryat Harvard which in the novel serves as a setting for the headquarters of the Gilead Secret Service.[10]Gilead society[edit]Religion[edit]Bruce Miller, the creator and executive producer ofThe Handmaid's Taletelevision serial, declared with regard to Atwood's book, as well as his series, that Gilead is ""a society that's based kind of in a perverse misreading of Old Testament laws and codes"".[35]The author explains that Gilead tries to embody the ""utopian idealism"" present in 20th-century regimes, as well as earlierNew England Puritanism.[22]Both Atwood and Miller stated that the people running Gilead are ""not genuinely Christian"".[36][35]The group running Gilead, according to Atwood, is ""not really interested in religion; they're interested in power"".[24]In herprayersto God, Offred reflects on Gilead and prays ""I don't believe for an instant that what's going on out there is what You meant... I suppose I should say I forgive whoever did this, and whatever they're doing now. I'll try, but it isn't easy.""[37]Margaret Atwood, writing on this, says that ""Offred herself has a private version of theLord's Prayerand refuses to believe that this regime has been mandated by a just and merciful God.""[9]Christian churches that do not support the actions of the Sons of Jacob are systematically demolished, and the people living in Gilead are never seenattending church.[35]Christian denominations, includingQuakers,Baptists,Jehovah's Witnesses, andRoman Catholics, are specifically named as enemies of the Sons of Jacob.[24][35]Nuns who refuse conversion are considered ""unwomen"" and banished to the Colonies, owing to their reluctance to marry and refusal (or inability) to bear children. Priests unwilling to convert are executed and hanged from the Wall. Atwood pits Quaker Christians against the regime by having them help the oppressed, something she feels they would do in reality: ""The Quakers have gone underground, and are running an escape route to Canada, as—I suspect—they would.""[9]Jewsare named an exception and classified Sons ofJacob. Offred observes that Jews refusing to convert are allowed to emigrate from Gilead to Israel, and most choose to leave. However, in the epilogue, Professor Pieixoto reveals that many of the emigrating Jews ended up being dumped into the sea while on the ships ostensibly tasked with transporting them to Israel, due to privatization of the ""repatriation program"" and capitalists' effort to maximize profits. Offred mentions that many Jews who chose to stay were caughtsecretly practising Judaismand executed.Women[edit]WivesThe top social level permitted to women, achieved by marriage to higher-ranking officers (Commanders). Wives always wear blue dresses and cloaks, suggesting traditional depictions of theVirgin Maryin historic Christian art. When a Commander dies, his Wife becomes aWidowand must dress in black until/unless she remarries.DaughtersThe natural or adopted children of theruling class. They wear white until marriage, which isarrangedby the government. The narrator's daughter may have been adopted by an infertile Wife and Commander, and she is shown in a photograph wearing a long white dress.HandmaidsThebonnetsthat handmaids wear are modelled onOld Dutch Cleanser's faceless mascot, which Atwood in childhood found frightening.[9]Fertile women whosesocial functionis to bear children for infertile wives.Handmaidsdress in ankle-length red dresses, white caps, and heavy boots. In summer, they change into lighter-weight (but still ankle-length) dresses and slatted shoes. When in public, in winter, they wear ankle-length red cloaks, red gloves, and heavy whitebonnets, which they call ""wings"". The sides of the bonnets stick out like wings, blocking their peripheral vision and shielding their faces from view. Handmaids are women of proven fertility who have broken the law. The law includes both gender crimes, such as lesbianism, and religious crimes, such as adultery (redefined to include sexual relationships with divorced partners since divorce is no longer legal). The Republic of Gilead justifies the use of the Handmaids for procreation by referring to two biblical stories: Genesis 30:1–13 and Genesis 16:1–4. In the first story, Jacob's infertile wife Rachel offers up her handmaidBilhahto be a surrogate mother on her behalf, and then her sister Leah does the same with her own handmaidZilpah(even though Leah has already given Jacob many sons). In the other story, which appears earlier in Genesis but is cited less frequently, Abraham has sex with his wife's handmaid,Hagar. Handmaids are assigned to Commanders and live in their houses. When unassigned, they live at training centres. Handmaids who successfully bear children continue to live at their Commander's house until their children are weaned, at which point they are sent to a new assignment to a new Commander. Those who produce children will never be declared ""unwomen"" or sent to the Colonies, even if they never have another baby.AuntsTrainers of the Handmaids. They dress in brown. Aunts promote the role of Handmaid as an honourable way for a sinful woman to redeem herself. They police the Handmaids, beating some and ordering the maiming of others. The Aunts have an unusual amount of autonomy, compared to other women of Gilead. They are the only class of women permitted to read and write, although this is only to fulfil the administrative aspect of their role.MarthasThey are older, infertile women who have domestic skills and are compliant, making them suitable as servants within the households of the Commanders and their families. They dress in green. The title of ""Martha"" is based on the account ofJesus at the home of Martha and Mary(Gospel of Luke10:38–42), in whichMarylistens to Jesus while her sisterMarthaworks at ""all the preparations that had to be made"". The duties of Marthas may be tasked to Guardians of the Faith, paramilitary officers who police Gilead's civilian population and guard the Commanders, wherever conflict with Gilead's laws may arise, such as with cleaning a Commander's study where Marthas could obtain literature.EconowivesWomen married to men of lower-rank, not members of the elite. They are expected to perform all the female functions: domestic duties, companionship, and child-bearing. Their dress is multicoloured red, blue, and green to reflect these multiple roles, and is made of notably cheaper material.Thedivision of labouramong the women generates some resentment. Marthas, Wives and Econowives perceive Handmaids as promiscuous and are taught to scorn them. Offred mourns that the women of the various groups have lost their ability to empathize with each other.The Ceremony[edit]""The Ceremony"" is a non-maritalsexual actsanctioned for reproduction. The ritual requires the Handmaid to lie on her back between the legs of the Wife during the sex act as if they were one person. The Wife has to invite the Handmaid to share her power this way; many Wives consider this both humiliating and offensive. Offred describes the ceremony:My red skirt is hitched up to my waist, though no higher. Below it the Commander is fucking. What he is fucking is the lower part of my body. I do not say making love, because this is not what he's doing. Copulating too would be inaccurate because it would imply two people and only one is involved. Nor does rape cover it: nothing is going on here that I haven't signed up for.[38]Reception[edit]Critical reception[edit]The Handmaid's Talereceived critical acclaim, helping to cement Atwood's status as a prominent writer of the 20th century. Not only was the book deemed well-written and compelling, but Atwood's work was notable for sparking intense debates both in and out of academia.[39][failed verification]Atwood maintains that the Republic of Gilead is only an extrapolation of trends already seen in the United States at the time of her writing, a view supported by other scholars studyingThe Handmaid's Tale.[40]Many have placedThe Handmaid's Talein the same category ofdystopian fictionasNineteen Eighty-FourandBrave New World,[15]a categorization that Atwood has accepted and reiterated in many articles and interviews.[16]Even today, many reviewers hold that Atwood's novel remains as foreboding and powerful as ever, largely because of its basis in historical fact.[21][23]Yet when her book was first published in 1985, not all reviewers were convinced of the ""cautionary tale"" Atwood presented. For example, Mary McCarthy's 1986New York Timesreview argued thatThe Handmaid's Talelacked the ""surprised recognition"" necessary for readers to see ""our present selves in a distorting mirror, of what we may be turning into if current trends are allowed to continue"".[26]Genre classification[edit]See also:Social science fictionThe Handmaid's Taleis a feminist dystopian novel,[41][42]combining the characteristics ofdystopian fiction: ""a genre that projects an imaginary society that differs from the author's own, first, by being significantly worse in important respects and second by being worsebecauseit attempts to reify someutopianideal"",[43]with thefeministutopian ideal which: ""sees men ormasculine systemsas the major cause of social and political problems (e.g. war), and presents women as not only at least the equals of men but also asthe sole arbiters of their reproductive functions"".[44][45]The Encyclopedia of Science Fictionnotes that dystopian images are almost invariably images of future society, ""pointing fearfully at the way the world is supposedly going in order to provide urgent propaganda for a change in direction"".[46]Atwood's stated intent was indeed to dramatize potential consequences of current trends.[47]In 1985, reviewers hailed the book as a ""feminist1984"",[48]citing similarities between the totalitarian regimes under which both protagonists live, and ""the distinctively modern sense of nightmare come true, the initial paralyzed powerlessness of the victim unable to act"".[49]Scholarly studies have expanded on the place ofThe Handmaid's Talein the dystopian and feminist traditions.[49][19][50][14][48]The classification of utopian and dystopian fiction as a sub-genre of the collective term,speculative fiction, alongsidescience fiction,fantasy, andhorroris a relatively recent convention. Dystopian novels have long been discussed as a type of science fiction; however, with publication ofThe Handmaid's Tale, Atwood distinguished the terms science fiction and speculative fiction quite intentionally. In interviews and essays, she has discussed why, observing:I like to make a distinction between science fiction proper and speculative fiction. For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can't yet do, such as going through a wormhole in space to another universe; and speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand, such as DNA identification and credit cards, and that takes place on Planet Earth. But the terms are fluid.[51]Atwood acknowledges that others may use the terms interchangeably, but she notes her interest in this type of work is to explore themes in ways that ""realisticfiction"" cannot do.[51]Among a few science fiction aficionados, however, Atwood's comments were considered petty and contemptuous. (The term speculative fiction was indeed employed that way by certain New Wave writers in the 1960s and early 1970s to express their dissatisfaction with traditional orestablishmentscience fiction.)Hugo-winningscience fiction criticDavid Langfordobserved in a column: ""The Handmaid's Talewon the very firstArthur C. Clarke Awardin 1987. She's been trying to live this down ever since.""[52]Reception in schools[edit]Atwood's novels, and especially her works of speculative fiction,The Handmaid's TaleandOryx and Crake, are frequently offered as examples for the final, open-ended question on the AmericanAdvanced PlacementEnglish Literature and Composition exam each year.[53]As such, her books are often assigned in high-school classrooms to students taking this Advanced Placement course, despite the mature themes the work presents. Atwood herself has expressed surprise that her books are being assigned to high-school audiences, largely due to her own censored education in the 1950s, but she has assured readers that this increased attention from high-school students has not altered the material she has chosen to write about since.[54]Censorship in the United States[edit]TheAmerican Library AssociationlistsThe Handmaid's Taleas number 37 on the ""100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000"".[55]In 2019,The Handmaid's Taleis still listed as the seventh-most challenged book because of profanity, vulgarity, and sexual overtones.[56]Atwood participated in discussingThe Handmaid's Taleas the subject of an ALA discussion series titled ""One Book, One Conference"".[57]In 2009, a parent in Toronto accused the book of being anti-Christian and anti-Islamic because the women are veiled and polygamy is allowed.[58]Rushowy reports that ""TheCanadian Library Associationsays there is 'no known instance of a challenge to this novel in Canada', but says the book was called anti-Christian and pornographic by parents after being placed on a reading list for secondary students in Texas in the 1990s.""[59]A 2012 challenge as required reading for a Page High SchoolInternational Baccalaureateclass and as optional reading for Advanced Placement reading courses atGrimsley High SchoolinGreensboro, North Carolinabecause the book is ""sexually explicit, violently graphic and morally corrupt"". Some parents thought the book is ""detrimental to Christian values"".[60]In November 2012, two parents protested against the inclusion of the book on a required reading list in Guilford County, North Carolina. The parents presented the school board with a petition signed by 2,300 people, prompting a review of the book by the school's media advisory committee. According to local news reports, one of the parents said ""she felt Christian students are bullied in society, in that they're made to feel uncomfortable about their beliefs by non-believers. She said including books likeThe Handmaid's Talecontributes to that discomfort, because of its negative view on religion and its anti-biblical attitudes toward sex.""[61]In November 2021 inGoddard, Kansas, ""The Goddard school district has removed more than two dozen books from circulation in the district's school libraries, citing national attention and challenges to the books elsewhere.""[62]In May 2022, Atwood announced that, in a joint project undertaken withPenguin Random House, an ""unburnable"" copy of the book would be produced and auctioned off, the project intended to ""stand as a powerful symbol againstcensorship"".[63]On 7 June 2022, the unique, ""unburnable"" copy was sold throughSotheby'sin New York for $130,000.[64]The book has been banned in school libraries in Florida, Missouri, Oregon,[65][66]Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas,[67][68]Utah, Virginia,[69]Wisconsin, and Wyoming.[70]In higher education[edit]In institutions of higher education, professors have foundThe Handmaid's Taleto be useful, largely because of its historical and religious basis and Atwood's captivating delivery. The novel's teaching points include: introducing politics and the social sciences to students in a more concrete way;[71][72]demonstrating the importance of reading to our freedom, both intellectual and political;[73]and acknowledging the ""most insidious and violent manifestations of power in Western history"" in a compelling manner.[74]The chapter entitled ""Historical Notes"" at the end of the novel also represents a warning to academics who run the risk of misreading and misunderstanding historical texts, pointing to the satirized Professor Pieixoto as an example of a male scholar who has taken over and overpowered Offred's narrative with his own interpretation.[75]Academic reception[edit]Feminist analysis[edit]Much of the discussion aboutThe Handmaid's Talehas centred on its categorization as feminist literature. Atwood does not see the Republic of Gilead as a purelyfeministdystopia, as not all men have greater rights than women.[22]Instead, this society presents a typical dictatorship: ""shaped like a pyramid, with the powerful of both sexes at the apex, the men generally outranking the women at the same level; then descending levels of power and status with men and women in each, all the way down to the bottom, where the unmarried men must serve in the ranks before being awarded an Econowife"".[22]Econowives are women expected to carry out child-bearing, domestic duties, and traditional companionship; they are married to men that don't belong to the elite. When asked about whether her book was feminist, Atwood stated that the presence of women and what happens to them are important to the structure and theme of the book. This aisle of feminism, by default, would make a lot of books feminist. However, she is adamant in her stance that her book did not represent the brand of feminism that victimizes or strips women of moral choice.[76]Atwood has argued that while some of the observations that informed the content ofThe Handmaid's Talemay be feminist, her novel is not meant to say ""one thing to one person"" or serve as a political message—instead,The Handmaid's Taleis ""a study of power, and how it operates and how it deforms or shapes the people who are living within that kind of regime"".[15][16]Some scholars have offered a feminist interpretation, connecting Atwood's use of religious fundamentalism in the pages ofThe Handmaid's Taleto a condemnation of its presence in current American society.[77][78]Atwood goes on to describe her book as not a critique of religion, but a critique of theuseof religion as a ""front for tyranny"".[79]Others have argued thatThe Handmaid's Talecritiques typical notions of feminism, as Atwood's novel appears to subvert the traditional ""women helping women"" ideals of the movement and turns toward the possibility of ""thematriarchalnetwork ... and a new form of misogyny: women's hatred of women"".[80]Scholars have analyzed and made connections to patriarchal oppression inThe Handmaid's Taleand oppression of women today. Aisha Matthews tackles the effects of institutional structures that oppress woman and womanhood and connects those to the themes present inThe Handmaid's Tale. She first asserts that structures and social frameworks, such as the patriarchy and societal role of traditional Christian values, are inherently detrimental to the liberation of womanhood. She then makes the connection to the relationship between Offred, Serena Joy, and the Commander, explaining that through this ""perversion of traditional marriage, the Biblical story of Rachel, Jacob, and Bilhah is taken too literally"". Their relationship and other similar relationships inThe Handmaid's Talemirror the effects of patriarchal standards of womanliness.[81]Sex and occupationIn the world ofThe Handmaid's Tale, the sexes are strictly divided. Gilead's society values white women's reproductive commodities over those of other ethnicities. Women are categorized ""hierarchically according to class status and reproductive capacity"" as well as ""metonymicallycolour-coded according to their function and their labour"".[82]The Commander expresses his personal opinion that women are considered inferior to men, as the men are in a position where they have power to control society.Women are segregated by clothing, as are men. With rare exceptions, men wear military or paramilitary uniforms. All classes of men and women are defined by the colours they wear, drawing on colour symbolism and psychology. All lower-status individuals are regulated by this dress code. All ""non-persons"" are banished to the ""Colonies"". Sterile, unmarried women are considered to be non-persons. Both men and women sent there wear grey dresses.The women, particularly the Handmaids, are stripped of their individual identities as they lack formal names, taking on their assigned Commander's first name in most cases.UnwomenSterile women, the unmarried, some widows, feminists, lesbians, nuns, and politically dissident women: all women who are incapable ofsocial integrationwithin the Republic's strict gender divisions. Gilead exiles Unwomen to ""the Colonies"", areas both of agricultural production and deadly pollution. Joining them are Handmaids who fail to bear a child after three two-year assignments.JezebelsJezebels are women who are forced to become prostitutes and entertainers. They are available only to the Commanders and to their guests. Offred portrays Jezebels as attractive and educated; they may be unsuitable as Handmaids due to temperament. They have been sterilized, a surgery that is forbidden to other women. They operate in unofficial but state-sanctioned brothels, unknown to most women.Jezebels, whose title comes fromJezebelin the Bible, dress in the remnants of sexualized costumes from ""the time before"", such as cheerleaders' costumes, school uniforms, andPlayboy Bunnycostumes. Jezebels can wear make-up, drink alcohol and socialize with men, but are tightly controlled by the Aunts. When they pass their sexual prime or their looks fade, they are discarded without any precision as to whether they are killed or sent to the Colonies.Philosophical analysis[edit]Many elements of Gilead recall details from Plato'sRepublic. Gilead's social hierarchy of commanders, guardians, Marthas and handmaids, for example, has similarities to Plato's social hierarchy of philosopher-guardians, auxiliary-guardians and producers. Both societies are also home to a state-based eugenics program, and see gymnasiums used as educational spaces in which women are socialized into new gender roles. The powers that be in Gilead legitimize their rule through the extensive use of propaganda, much as Plato's rulers ensure co-operation on the part of the public by propagating anoble lie.According to philosopher Andy Lamey, rather than straightforward allusions, the similarities to Plato are combined with features that differ, at times dramatically, from Plato's original. As Lamey writes, ""the result is that Atwood's dystopia deliberately calls to mind a distorted version of Platonism, one that differs in ways large and small from the original.""[83]In the case of gymnasiums, for example, in Plato they see women socialized into roles that make them the equal of men, while in Gilead they are where handmaids are first taught their duties.Vernon Provençal has suggested that the novel is a satire of Platonism.[83]Lamey, however, argues that this interpretation cannot explain why the book contains distorted references to philosophies beyond Platonism. Two such references are evident in mottos that handmaids are forced to repeat during their training. ""Pen is envy"" is a corrupt rendering of Freud's notion of penis envy, while ""From each according to her ability; to each according to his needs"" is a garbled version of Marx's slogan ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."" Lamey argues that such allusions, rather than satirizing the philosophies in question, see Gilead employ a practice frequently used by actual dictatorships, that of seeking to bolster their prestige and legitimacy by twisting ideas already in circulation to suit their own ends.Race analysis[edit]African Americans, the main non-White ethnic group in this society, are called theChildren of Ham. A state TV broadcast mentions they have been relocated ""en masse"" to ""National Homelands"" in North Dakota, which are suggestive of the apartheid-era homelands (Bantustans) set up by South Africa or forced death marches. Ana Cottle characterizedThe Handmaid's Taleas ""White feminism"", noting that Atwood does away with Black people in a few lines by relocating the ""Children of Ham"" while borrowing heavily from the African-American experience and applying it to White women, specifically Gilead's explicit anti-literacy laws, which was borrowed from real lifeanti-literacy campaignsin the United States, alongside the removal of surnames among handmaids, an ode to how enslaved Africans were not given last names until Emancipation.[84][85]It is implied that a total genocide has been committed againstNative Americansliving in territories under the rule of Gilead.Jewswere given a choice between converting to the state religion or being ""repatriated"" toIsrael. Converts who were subsequently discovered with any symbolic representations or artifacts ofJudaismwere executed, and the repatriation scheme was privatized, with the result that many Jews died en route to Israel.Awards[edit]1985 –Governor General's Award for English-language fiction(winner)[86]1986 –Booker Prize(nominated)[87]1986 –Nebula Award(nominated)[88]1986 –Los Angeles TimesBook Prize for Fiction(winner)[89]1987 –Arthur C.

Retrieved13 December2016.If you're writing about the future and you aren't doing forecast journalism, you'll probably be writing something people will call either science fiction or speculative fiction. I like to make a distinction between science fiction proper and speculative fiction. For me, the science fiction label belongs on books with things in them that we can't yet do, such as going through a wormhole in space to another universe; and speculative fiction means a work that employs the means already to hand, such as DNA identification and credit cards, and that takes place on Planet Earth. But the terms are fluid. Some use speculative fiction as an umbrella covering science fiction and all its hyphenated forms–science fiction fantasy, and so forth–and others choose the reverse... I have written two works of science fiction or, if you prefer, speculative fiction:The Handmaid's TaleandOryx and Crake.

It tied withRoger Zelazny'sThis Immortalfor theHugo Award for Best Noveland won the inauguralNebula Award for Best Novelin 1966. It is the first installment of theDune Chronicles. It is one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.[3]Duneis set in the distant future in afeudalinterstellar society, descended from terrestrial humans, in which various noble houses control planetaryfiefs. It tells the story of youngPaul Atreides, whose family reluctantly accepts the stewardship of the planetArrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source ofmelangeor ""spice"", an enormously valuable drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.Herbert wrote fivesequels:Dune Messiah,Children of Dune,God Emperor of Dune,Heretics of Dune, andChapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his sonBrian Herbertand authorKevin J. Andersoncontinued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmakerAlejandro Jodorowskyattempted to makea filmbased on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, afilm adaptationdirected byDavid Lynchwas released to mostly negative responses from critics and failure at the box office, although it later developed acult following. The book was also adapted into the 2000Sci-Fi ChannelminiseriesFrank Herbert's Duneand its 2003 sequel,Frank Herbert's Children of Dune(the latter of which combines the events ofDune MessiahandChildren of Dune). A secondfilm adaptation, directed byDenis Villeneuve, was released on October 21, 2021, to positive reviews. It went on to be nominated for tenAcademy Awards, includingBest Picture, ultimately winning six. Villeneuve's film covers roughly the first half of the original novel; asequel, which covers the second half, was released on March 1, 2024, to critical acclaim. Both films have grossed over $1 billion worldwide.The series has also been used as the basis forseveral board, role-playing, and video games.Since 2009, the names of planets from theDunenovels have been adopted for the real-life nomenclature of plains and other features onSaturn's moonTitan.Origins[edit]TheOregon Dunes, nearFlorence, Oregon, served as an inspiration for theDunesaga.After his novelThe Dragon in the Seawas published in 1957, Herbert traveled toFlorence, Oregon, at the north end of theOregon Dunes. Here, theUnited States Department of Agriculturewas attempting to usepoverty grassesto stabilize thesand dunes. Herbert claimed in a letter to his literary agent,Lurton Blassingame, that the moving dunes could ""swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways.""[4]Herbert's article on the dunes, ""They Stopped the Moving Sands"", was never completed (and only published decades later inThe Road to Dune), but its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts.[5]Herbert further drew inspiration fromNative Americanmentors like ""Indian Henry"" (as Herbert referred to the man to his son; likely a Henry Martin of theHoh tribe) and Howard Hansen. Both Martin and Hansen grew up on theQuileutereservationnear Herbert's hometown. According to historianDaniel Immerwahr, Hansen regularly shared his writing with Herbert. ""White menare eating the earth,"" Hansen told Herbert in 1958, after sharing a piece on the effect of logging on the Quileute reservation. ""They're gonna turn this whole planet into a wasteland, just likeNorth Africa."" The world could become a ""big dune,"" Herbert responded in agreement.[6]Herbert was also interested in the idea of thesuperheromystiqueandmessiahs. He believed thatfeudalismwas a natural condition humans fell into, where some led and others gave up the responsibility of making decisions and just followed orders. He found that desert environments have historically given birth to several major religions with messianic impulses. He decided to join his interests together so he could play religious and ecological ideas against each other. In addition, he was influenced by the story ofT. E. Lawrenceand the ""messianic overtones"" in Lawrence's involvement in theArab RevoltduringWorld War I. In an early version ofDune, the hero was actually very similar to Lawrence of Arabia, but Herbert decided the plot was too straightforward and added more layers to his story.[7]Herbert drew heavy inspiration also fromLesley Blanch'sThe Sabres of Paradise(1960), anarrative historyrecounting a mid-19th-centuryconflict in the Caucasusbetween rugged caucasian Muslim tribes and the expandingRussian Empire.[8]Language used on both sides of that conflict become terms in Herbert's world—chakobsa, aCaucasianhunting language, becomes a battle language of humans spread across the galaxy;kanly, a word for blood feud in the 19th-century Caucasus, represents a feud between Dune's noble Houses;sietchandtabirare both words for camp borrowed fromUkrainian Cossacks(of thePontic–Caspian steppe).[8]Herbert also borrowed some lines which Blanch stated were Caucasian proverbs.""To kill with the point lacked artistry"", used by Blanch to describe the Caucasus peoples' love of swordsmanship, becomes in Dune""Killing with the tip lacks artistry"", a piece of advice given to a young Paul during his training.""Polish comes from the city, wisdom from the hills"", a Caucasianaphorism, turns into a desert expression:""Polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert"".[8]Another significant source of inspiration forDunewas Herbert's experiences withpsilocybinand his hobby of cultivating mushrooms, according tomycologistPaul Stamets's account of meeting Herbert in the 1980s:[9]Frank went on to tell me that much of the premise ofDune—the magicspice(spores) that allowed the bending of space (tripping), thegiant sand worms(maggotsdigesting mushrooms), the eyes of theFreman(theceruleanblue ofPsilocybemushrooms), the mysticism of the female spiritual warriors, theBene Gesserits(influenced by the tales ofMaria Sabinaand the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico)—came from his perception of the fungal life cycle, and his imagination was stimulated through his experiences with the use ofmagic mushrooms.Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising. He published a three-part serialDune Worldin the monthlyAnalog, from December 1963 to February 1964. The serial was accompanied by several illustrations that were not published again. After an interval of a year, he published the much slower-paced five-partThe Prophet of Dunein the January–May 1965 issues.[10][11]The first serial became ""Book One: Dune"" in the final publishedDunenovel, and the second serial was divided into ""Book Two: Muad'dib"" and ""Book Three: The Prophet"". The serialized version was expanded, reworked, and submitted to more than twenty publishers, each of whom rejected it. The novel,Dune, was finally accepted and published in August 1965 byChilton Books, a printing house better known for publishing auto repair manuals.[12]Sterling Lanier, an editor at Chilton, had seen Herbert's manuscript and had urged his company to take a risk in publishing the book. However, the first printing, priced at$5.95(equivalent to $59.37 in 2024), did not sell well and was poorly received by critics as being atypical of science fiction at the time. Chilton considered the publication ofDunea write-off and Lanier was fired.[13]Over the course of time, the book gained critical acclaim, and its popularity spread by word-of-mouth to allow Herbert to start working full time on developing the sequels toDune, elements of which were already written alongsideDune.[14]At first Herbert considered usingMarsas setting for his novel, but eventually decided to use a fictional planet instead. His son Brian said that ""Readers would have too many preconceived ideas about that planet, due to the number of stories that had been written about it.""[15]Herbert dedicated his work ""to the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'—to the dry-landecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.""[16]Plot[edit]DukeLeto AtreidesofHouse Atreides, ruler of theocean worldCaladan, is assigned by thePadishah EmperorShaddam IVto serve as fief ruler of the planetArrakis. Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitabledesert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary source ofmelange, or the ""spice"", a unique and incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan. It is also through the consumption of spice thatSpacing GuildNavigators are able to effect safe interstellar travel through a limited ability to see into the future. The Emperor is jealous of the Duke's rising popularity in theLandsraad, the council of Great Houses, and sees House Atreides as a potential rival and threat. He conspires withHouse Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies of the Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival. Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind, but is compelled to obey the Emperor's orders anyway.Leto'sconcubineLady Jessicais an acolyte of theBene Gesserit, an exclusively female group that pursues mysterious political aims and wields seeminglysuperhumanphysical and mental abilities, such as the ability to control their bodies down to the cellular level, and also decide the sex of their children. Though Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of theirbreeding program, out of love for Leto she bore him a son,Paul. From a young age, Paul is trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite soldiersDuncan IdahoandGurney Halleck.Thufir Hawat, the Duke'sMentat(human computers, able to store vast amounts of data and perform advanced calculations on demand), has instructed Paul in the ways of political intrigue. Jessica has also trained her son in Bene Gesserit disciplines.Paul'spropheticdreams interest Jessica's superior, theReverend MotherGaius Helen Mohiam. She subjects Paul to a deadly test. She holds a poisoned needle, thegom jabbar, to his neck, ready to strike should he withdraw his hand from a box which creates extreme pain by nerve induction but causes no physical damage. This is to test Paul's ability to endure the pain and override his animal instincts, proving that he is, in Bene Gesserit eyes, human. Paul passes, enduring greater pain than any woman has ever been subjected to in the test.Paul and his parents travel with their household to occupyArrakeen, the capital on Arrakis. Leto learns of the dangers involved in harvesting the spice, which is protected by giantsandworms, and seeks to negotiate with the planet's indigenousFremenpeople, seeing them as a valuable ally rather than foes. Soon after the Atreides' arrival, Harkonnen forces attack, joined by the Emperor's ferociousSardaukartroops in disguise. Leto is betrayed by his personal physician, theSuk doctorWellington Yueh, who delivers a drugged Leto to the BaronVladimir Harkonnenand his twisted Mentat,Piter De Vries.Yueh, who delivered Leto under duress, arranges for Jessica and Paul to escape into the desert. Duncan is killed helping them flee, and they are subsequently presumed dead in a sandstorm by the Harkonnens. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule, hoping Leto can kill Baron Harkonnen during their encounter. Piter kills Yueh, and the Baron narrowly avoids the gas (due to his defensive shield), which kills Leto, Piter, and the others in the room. The Baron forces Thufir to take over Piter's position by dosing him with a long-lasting, fatal poison and threatening to withhold the regular antidote doses. While he follows the Baron's orders, Thufir works secretly to undermine the Harkonnens.Having fled into the desert, Paul is exposed to high concentrations of spice and has visions through which he realizes he has significant powers (as a result of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme). He foresees potential futures in which he lives among the Fremen before leading them on aholy waracross the known universe. Paul reveals that Jessica's father is Baron Harkonnen, a secret kept from her by the Bene Gesserit.Paul and Jessica traverse the desert in search of Fremen people. After being captured by a Fremen band, Paul and Jessica agree to teach the Fremen the Bene Gesserit fighting technique known to the Fremen as the ""weirding way"" and are accepted into the community ofSietch Tabr. Paul proves his manhood by killing a Fremen man named Jamis in a ritualisticcrysknifefight and chooses the Fremen name Muad'Dib, while Jessica opts to undergo a ritual to become a Reverend Mother by drinking and neutralizing the poisonousWater of Life. Pregnant with Leto's daughter, she inadvertently causes her unborn daughterAliato become infused with the same powers in the womb. Paul takes a Fremen lover,Chani, who bears him a son he names Leto.Two years pass, and Paul's powerful prescience manifests, which confirms to the Fremen that he is their prophesied ""Lisan al-Gaib""messiah, a legend planted by the Bene Gesserit'sMissionaria Protectiva. Paul embraces his father's belief that the Fremen could be a powerful fighting force to take back Arrakis, but also sees that if he does not control them, theirjihadcould consume the entire universe. Word of the new Fremen leader reaches both the Baron and the Emperor as spice production falls due to their increasingly destructive raids. The Baron encourages his brutish nephewGlossu ""Beast"" Rabbanto rule with an iron fist, hoping the contrast with his shrewder nephewFeyd-Rauthawill make the latter popular among the people of Arrakis when he eventually replaces Rabban. The Emperor, suspecting the Baron of trying to create troops more powerful than the Sardaukar to seize power, sends spies to Arrakis. Thufir uses the opportunity to sow seeds of doubt in the Baron about the Emperor's true plans, putting further strain on their alliance.Gurney, who survived the Harkonnen coup and became a smuggler, reunites with Paul and Jessica after a Fremen raid on his harvester. Believing Jessica to be a traitor, Gurney threatens to kill her but is stopped by Paul. Paul did not foresee Gurney's attack and concludes he must increase his prescience by drinking the Water of Life, which is fatal to males. Paul falls into unconsciousness for three weeks after drinking the poison, but when he wakes, he has clairvoyance across time and space: heistheKwisatz Haderach, the ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit breeding program.Paul senses the Emperor and the Baron are amassing fleets around Arrakis to quell the Fremen rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a major offensive. The Emperor arrives with the Baron on Arrakis. The Sardaukar seize a Fremen outpost, killing many, including young Leto, while Alia is captured and taken to the Emperor. Under cover of an electric storm, which shorts out the Sardaukar's defensive shields, Paul and the Fremen, riding giant sandworms, destroy the capital's natural rock fortifications withatomicsand attack, while Alia assassinates the Baron and escapes. The Fremen quickly defeat both the Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops, killing Rabban in the process. Thufir is ordered to assassinate Paul, who gives him the opportunity to take anything that Thufir wishes of him. Thufir chooses to stab himself with the poisoned needle intended for Paul.Paul faces the Emperor, threatening to destroy spice production forever unless Shaddam abdicates the throne. Feyd-Rautha challenges Paul to a knife fight, during which he cheats and tries to kill Paul with a poison spur in his belt. Paul gains the upper hand and kills him. The Emperor reluctantly cedes the throne to Paul and promises his daughterPrincess Irulan's hand in marriage. Paul takes control of the Empire, but realizes that he cannot stop the Fremen jihad, as their belief in him is too powerful to restrain.Characters[edit]House AtreidesPaul Atreides, the Duke's son, and main character of the novelDukeLeto Atreides, head ofHouse AtreidesLady Jessica,Bene Gesseritandconcubineof the Duke, mother of Paul and AliaAlia Atreides, Paul's younger sisterThufir Hawat,Mentatand Master of Assassins to House AtreidesGurney Halleck, staunchly loyal troubadour warrior of the AtreidesDuncan Idaho, Swordmaster for House Atreides, graduate of theGinaz SchoolWellington Yueh,Suk doctorfor the Atreides who is secretly working for House HarkonnenHouse HarkonnenBaronVladimir Harkonnen, head ofHouse HarkonnenPiter De Vries, twisted MentatFeyd-Rautha, nephew and heir-presumptive of the BaronGlossu ""Beast"" Rabban, also called Rabban Harkonnen, older nephew of the BaronIakin Nefud, Captain of the GuardHouse CorrinoShaddam IV,Padishah Emperorof the Known Universe (the Imperium)Princess Irulan, Shaddam's eldest daughter and heir, also a historianCount Fenring, the Emperor's closest friend, advisor, and ""errand boy""Bene GesseritReverend MotherGaius Helen Mohiam, Proctor Superior of the Bene Gesserit school and the Emperor'sTruthsayerLadyMargot Fenring, Bene Gesserit wife of Count FenringFremenTheFremen, native inhabitants of ArrakisStilgar, Fremen leader ofSietch TabrChani, Paul's Fremen concubine and a Sayyadina (female acolyte) of Sietch TabrDr.Liet-Kynes, the Imperial Planetologist on Arrakis and father of Chani, as well as a revered figure among the FremenTheShadout Mapes, head housekeeper of imperial residence on ArrakisJamis, Fremen killed by Paul in ritual duelHarah, wife of Jamis and later servant to Paul who helps raise Alia among the FremenReverend Mother Ramallo, religious leader of Sietch TabrSmugglersEsmar Tuek, a powerful smuggler and the father of Staban TuekStaban Tuek, the son of Esmar Tuek and a powerful smuggler who befriends and takes in Gurney Halleck and his surviving men after the attack on the AtreidesThemes and influences[edit]TheDuneseries is a landmark ofscience fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in hisDuneuniverse so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. For example, a key pre-history event to the novel's present is the ""Butlerian Jihad"", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity.[14]Duneconsiders the way humans and their institutions might change over time.[1]DirectorJohn Harrison, who adaptedDuneforSyfy's2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of ""the human condition and its moral dilemmas"", and said:A lot of people refer toDuneas science fiction. I never do. I consider it an epic adventure in the classic storytelling tradition, a story of myth and legend not unlike theMorte d'Arthuror any messiah story. It just happens to be set in the future ... The story is actually more relevant today than when Herbert wrote it. In the 1960s, there were just these two colossal superpowers duking it out. Today we're living in a more feudal, corporatized world more akin to Herbert's universe of separate families, power centers and business interests, all interrelated and kept together by the one commodity necessary to all.[17]ButDunehas also been called a mix ofsoftandhard science fictionsince ""the attention to ecology is hard, the anthropology and the psychic abilities are soft.""[18]Hard elements include the ecology of Arrakis, suspensor technology, weapon systems, and ornithopters, while soft elements include issues relating to religion, physical and mental training, cultures, politics, and psychology.[19]Herbert said Paul's messiah figure was inspired by theArthurianlegend,[20]and that thescarcity of wateron Arrakis was a metaphor foroil, as well as air and water itself, and for the shortages of resources caused byoverpopulation.[21]NovelistBrian Herbert, his son and biographer, wrote:Duneis a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange, the geriatric spice that represents, among other things, the finite resource of oil. The planet Arrakis features immense, ferocious worms that are like dragons of lore, with ""great teeth"" and a ""bellows breath of cinnamon."" This resembles the myth described by an unknown English poet inBeowulf, the compelling tale of a fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair under cliffs, at the edge of the sea. The desert of Frank Herbert's classic novel is a vast ocean of sand, with giant worms diving into the depths, the mysterious and unrevealed domain of Shai-hulud. Dune tops are like the crests of waves, and there are powerful sandstorms out there, creating extreme danger. On Arrakis, life is said to emanate from the Maker (Shai-hulud) in the desert-sea; similarly all life on Earth is believed to have evolved from our oceans. Frank Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated present conditions into world systems that seem entirely alien at first blush. But close examination reveals they aren't so different from systems we know ... and the book characters of his imagination are not so different from people familiar to us.[22]Each chapter ofDunebegins with anepigraphexcerpted from the fictional writings of the character Princess Irulan. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert's complex fictional universe and themes.[23][24][25]They act as foreshadowing and invite the reader to keep reading to close the gap between what the epigraph says and what is happening in the main narrative.[26]The epigraphs also give the reader the feeling that the world they are reading about is epically distanced, since Irulan writes about an idealized image of Paul as if he had already passed into memory.[27]Brian Herbert wrote: ""Dad told me that you could follow any of the novel's layers as you read it, and then start the book all over again, focusing on an entirely different layer. At the end of the book, he intentionally left loose ends and said he did this to send the readers spinning out of the story with bits and pieces of it still clinging to them, so that they would want to go back and read it again.""[28]Middle-Eastern and Islamic references[edit]Due to the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in theArabic language, as well as the series' ""Islamicundertones"" and themes, aMiddle-Easterninfluence on Herbert's works has been noted repeatedly.[29][30]In his descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words.[31][32]For example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived fromشيء خلود,šayʾ ḫulūd, 'immortal thing' orشيخ خلود,šayḫ ḫulūd, 'old man of eternity'.[32][33]The title of the Fremen housekeeper, the Shadout Mapes, is borrowed from theشادوف,šādūf, theEgyptianterm fora device used to raise water.[32]In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit, are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (fromمؤدب,muʾaddib, 'educator'), Lisan al-Gaib (fromلسان الغيب,lisān al-ġayb, 'voice of the unseen'), Usul (fromأصول,ʾuṣūl, 'fundamental principles'), Shari-a (fromشريعة,šarīʿa, 'sharia; path'), Shaitan (fromشيطان,šayṭān, 'Shaitan; devil; fiend'), and jinn (fromجن,ǧinn, 'jinn; spirit; demon; mythical being').[29]It is likely Herbert relied on second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen.[32]They are meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an ""imagined desert culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic references"" and has a distinctlyBedouinaesthetic.[32]As a foreigner who adopts the ways of a desert-dwelling people and then leads them in a military capacity, Paul Atreides bears many similarities to the historicalT. E. Lawrence.[34]His 1962 biopicLawrence of Arabiahas also been identified as a potential influence.[35]The Sabres of Paradise(1960) has also been identified as a potential influence uponDune, with its depiction ofImam Shamiland the Islamic culture of theCaucasusinspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology ofDune.[8]The environment of the desert planet Arrakis was primarily inspired by the environments of theMiddle East. Similarly Arrakis as a bioregion is presented as a particular kind of political site. Herbert has made it resemble a desertifiedpetrostatearea.[36]The Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes ofArabia, and theMahdiprophecy originates fromIslamic eschatology.[37]Inspiration is also adopted from medieval historianIbn Khaldun's cyclical history and hisdynastic conceptinNorth Africa, hinted at by Herbert's reference to Khaldun's bookKitāb al-ʿibar(""The Book of Lessons""). The fictionalized version of the ""Kitab al-ibar"" inDuneis a combination of a Fremen religious manual and a desert survival book.[38][39]Additional language and historic influences[edit]In addition to Arabic,Dunederives words and names from a variety of other languages, includingNavajo,Latin,Old Scandinavian(""Landsraad""),[40]Romani,Hebrew(""Kefitzat haderech"",קפיצת הדרך,contracting of the path),Serbo-Croatian,Nahuatl,Greek,Persian,Sanskrit(""prana bindu"", ""prajna""),Russian,Turkish,Finnish, andOld English.[41][42]Bene Gesseritis part of the Latin legal phrasequamdiu se bene gesserit""as long as he shall behave himself well"" seen in grants of certain offices (such as judgeships) meaning that the appointee shall remain in office so long as he shall not be guilty of abusing it. Some critics miss the connotation of the phrase, misled by the Latin future perfectgesserit, taking it over-literally (and adding an unwarranted passive) to mean ""it will have been well borne"", an interpretation which is not well supported by the Bene Gesserit doctrine in the story.[43][original research?]Through the inspiration fromThe Sabres of Paradise, there are also allusions to the tsarist-eraRussian nobilityandCossacks.[44]Frank Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind thearistocraticfamilies inDunewas ""aristocratic bureaucracy"" which he saw as analogous to theSoviet Union.[45][46]Environmentalism and ecology[edit]Dunehas been called the ""first planetaryecologynovel on a grand scale"".[47]Herbert hoped it would be seen as an ""environmental awarenesshandbook"" and said the title was meant to ""echo the sound of 'doom'"".[48]It was reviewed in the best-selling counterculturalWhole Earth Catalogin 1968 as a ""rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community"".[49]After the publication ofSilent SpringbyRachel Carsonin 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences.Duneresponded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of Arrakis life, from giant sandworms (for whom water is deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life-forms adapted to live with limited water.Dunewas followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such asA Door into Ocean(1986) andRed Mars(1992).[47]Environmentalists have pointed out thatDune'spopularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex—almost living—thing, in combination with thefirst images of Earth from spacebeing published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the internationalEarth Day.[50]While the genre ofclimate fictionwas popularized in the 2010s in response to real globalclimate change,Duneas well as other early science fiction works from authors likeJ. G. Ballard(The Drowned World) andKim Stanley Robinson(theMarstrilogy) have retroactively been considered pioneering examples of the genre.[51][52]Declining empires[edit]The Imperium inDunecontains features of various empires in Europe and theNear East, including theRoman Empire,Holy Roman Empire, andOttoman Empire.[33][53][54]Lorenzo DiTommaso comparedDune'sportrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire toEdward Gibbon'sDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire,which argues thatChristianityallied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall ofAncient Rome. In ""The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in Epic Science Fiction"" (2007), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of the Emperor on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as ""parasites"". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt and materially indulgent. Gibbon'sDecline and Fallpartly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack. The Emperor's Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Dune not only because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the fact that Jessica and Paul have trained the Fremen in their battle tactics, but because of the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others.[55]The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal bygenetic mixingof successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by Paul Atreides, described by Frank Herbert as depicting ""war as a collective orgasm"" (drawing on Norman Walter's 1950The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare),[56][57]themes that would reappear inGod Emperor of Dune'sScatteringand Leto II's all-femaleFish Speakerarmy.Gender dynamics[edit]Gender dynamicsare complex inDune. Herbert offers a multi-layered portrayal of gender roles within the context of a feudal, hierarchical society, particularly through the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood. Although the Bene Gesserit tend to hold roles that are traditionally associated with women, such as wives, concubines, and mothers, their characters transcend stereotypes as they play politics and pursue long-term strategic goals. Full gender equality is not depicted inDune, but the Bene Gesserit use specialized training and access to high-ranking men to gain agency and power within the constraints of their environment. Their training in prana-bindu allows them to exert control over their minds and bodies, including over pregnancy, and they are skilled in hand-to-hand combat and use of the Voice to command others. Jessica's disobedience in bearing a son instead of daughter and training him in the Bene Gesserit Way is a major plot point that sets in motion the events of the novel.[58][59]By setting up certain women with leaders of certain Houses in the Imperium, the Bene Gesserit can control bloodlines across generations through their secret breeding program.[60]Even within the male-dominated Imperium, then, the Bene Gesserit wield reproductive power and choose which genetic markers to continue into the future.[61]Reverend Mother Mohiam uses skills in Truthsaying to act as the Emperor's official Truthsayer and advisor. Her role can be considered similar to that ofabbessesin the medieval Church. Before Princess Irulan appears as a character who agrees to a political marriage with Paul, she acts as a historian who shapes the reader's interpretation of the story and Paul's legacy due to the excerpts from her writing that frame each chapter.[58][59]Among the Fremen, women have roles as mothers and wives and also exercise agency through combat and religious authority. Fremen women and children have a reputation for being just as violent and dangerous as Fremen men. Chani travels with Stilgar in his military party, armed like the others. After becoming Paul's concubine, she kills one of the men who comes to challenge him. Alia leads an attack against the Emperor's Sardaukar and kills Baron Harkonnen with a gom jabbar. Women also take on the role of religious leaders. Chani is a Sayyadina who presides over tribal rituals such as Paul's worm-riding test, and Reverend Mother Ramallo carries the tribe's memories and passes them along to Jessica through theWater of Lifeceremony. Within the male-led sietches, Fremen women find different avenues of authority.[62]The gom jabbar test of humanity is administered by the female Bene Gesserit order but rarely to males.[63]The Bene Gesserit have seemingly mastered the unconscious and can play on the unconscious weaknesses of others using the Voice, yet their breeding program seeks after a male Kwisatz Haderach.[34]Their plan is to produce a male who can ""possess complete racial memory, both male and female,"" and look into the black hole in the collective unconscious that they fear.[64]A central theme of the book is the connection, in Jessica's son, of this female aspect with his male aspect. This aligns with concepts inJungianpsychology, which features conscious/unconscious and taking/giving roles associated with males and females, as well as the idea of the collective unconscious.[65]Paul's approach to power consistently requires his upbringing under the matriarchal Bene Gesserit, who operate as a long-dominatingshadow governmentbehind all of the great houses and their marriages or divisions.[64]He is trained by Jessica in the Bene Gesserit Way, which includes prana-bindu training in nerve and muscle control and precise perception.[59]Paul also receives Mentat training, thus helping prepare him to be a type of androgynous Kwisatz Haderach, a male Reverend Mother.[64]In a Bene Gesserit test early in the book, it is implied that people are generally ""inhuman"" in that they irrationally place desire over self-interest and reason.[citation needed]This applies Herbert's philosophy that humans are not created equal, while equal justice and equal opportunity are higher ideals than mental, physical, or moral equality.[66]Heroism[edit]I am showing you the superhero syndrome and your own participation in it.—Frank Herbert[67]Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to manystories describing the birth of a hero.[68]He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale.[69][70]As such,Duneis representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means.[71]Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causes the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, ""The bottom line of theDunetrilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better to rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.""[72]He wrote in 1985, ""Dunewas aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.""[73]Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes ofDunefrom earlier heroes such asSuperman,van Vogt'sGilbert GosseynandHenry Kuttner's telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of ""painful and slow personal progress."" And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through ""the application of mystical philosophies and techniques."" For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen, Ginaz swordsmen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing Guild Navigators).[74]Zen and religion[edit]Main article:List of Dune religionsEarly in his newspaper career, Herbert was introduced toZenby twoJungianpsychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who ""gave a crucial boost to his thinking"".[75]Zen teachings ultimately had ""a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert's] work"".[75]Throughout theDuneseries and particularly inDune, Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed fromZen Buddhism.[75][76]The Fremen are referred to asZensunniadherents, and many of Herbert's epigraphs are Zen-spirited.[77]In ""DuneGenesis"", Frank Herbert wrote:What especially pleases me is to see the interwoven themes, the fugue like relationships of images that exactly replay the wayDunetook shape. As in anEscherlithograph, I involved myself with recurrent themes that turn into paradox. The central paradox concerns the human vision of time. What about Paul's gift of prescience—thePresbyterianfixation? For theDelphic Oracleto perform, it must tangle itself in a web ofpredestination. Yet predestination negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a mathematically enclosed universe whose limits are always inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It's like akoan, a Zen mind breaker. It's like theCretanEpimenidessaying, ""All Cretans are liars.""[66]Brian Herbert called theDuneuniverse ""a spiritual melting pot"", noting that his father incorporated elements of a variety of religions, includingBuddhism,Sufi mysticismand other Islamic belief systems,Catholicism,Protestantism,Judaism, andHinduism.[78]He added that Frank Herbert's fictional future in which ""religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms"" represents the author's solution to eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claimed to have ""the one and only revelation.""[78][79]Asimov'sFoundation[edit]Tim O'Reilly suggests that Herbert also wroteDuneas a counterpoint toIsaac Asimov'sFoundationseries. In hismonographon Frank Herbert, O'Reilly wrote that ""Duneis clearly a commentary on theFoundationtrilogy. Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov's classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions. The twist he has introduced intoDuneis thatthe Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero.""[80]According to O'Reilly, Herbert bases the Bene Gesserit on the scientific shamans of the Foundation, though they use biological rather than statistical science.[80]In contrast to theFoundationseries and its praise of science and rationality,Duneproposes that the unconscious and unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity.[80]Both Herbert and Asimov explore the implications of prescience (i.e., visions of the future) both psychologically and socially. TheFoundationseries deploys a broadly determinist approach to prescient vision rooted in mathematical reasoning on a macroscopic social level.Dune, by contrast, invents a biologically rooted power of prescience that becomes determinist when the user actively relies on it to navigate past an undefined threshold of detail. Herbert's eugenically produced and spice-enhanced prescience is also personalized to individual actors whose roles in later books constrain each other's visions, rendering the future more or less mutable as time progresses. In what might be a comment onFoundation, Herbert's most powerfully prescient being inGod Emperor of Dunelaments the boredom engendered by prescience, and values surprises, especially regarding one's death, as a psychological necessity.[citation needed]However, both works contain a similar theme of the restoration of civilization[81]and seem to make the fundamental assumption that ""political maneuvering, the need to control material resources, and friendship or mating bonds will be fundamentally the same in the future as they are now.""[82]Critical reception[edit]Dunetied withRoger Zelazny'sThis Immortalfor theHugo Awardin 1966[83]and won the inauguralNebula Award for Best Novel.[84]Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, andDuneis considered by some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written.[85]The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies.[86]Dunehas been regularly cited as one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.[3][87]Arthur C. ClarkedescribedDuneas ""unique"" and wrote, ""I know nothing comparable to it exceptThe Lord of the Rings.""[88]Robert A. Heinleindescribed the novel as ""powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.""[88][89]It was described as ""one of the monuments of modern science fiction"" by theChicago Tribune,[88]andP. Schuyler MillercalledDune""one of the landmarks of modern science fiction ... an amazing feat of creation.""[89]The Washington Postdescribed it as ""a portrayal of an alien society more complete and deeply detailed than any other author in the field has managed ... a story absorbing equally for its action and philosophical vistas ... An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.""[88][89]Algis BudryspraisedDunefor the vividness of its imagined setting, saying ""The time lives. It breathes, it speaks, and Herbert has smelt it in his nostrils"". He found that the novel, however, ""turns flat and tails off at the end. ... [T]ruly effective villains simply simper and melt; fierce men and cunning statesmen and seeresses all bend before this new Messiah"". Budrys faulted in particular Herbert's decision to kill Paul's infant son offstage, with no apparent emotional impact, saying ""you cannot be so busy saving a world that you cannot hear an infant shriek"".[90]After criticizing unrealistic science fiction,Carl Saganin 1978 listedDuneas among stories ""that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical"".[91]The Louisville Timeswrote, ""Herbert's creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics, and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.""[89]Writing forThe New Yorker, Jon Michaud praised Herbert's ""clever authorial decision"" to exclude robots and computers (""two staples of the genre"") from his fictional universe, but suggested that this may be one explanation whyDunelacks ""true fandom among science-fiction fans"" to the extent that it ""has not penetrated popular culture in the way thatThe Lord of the RingsandStar Warshave"".[14]Tamara I. Hladik wrote that the story ""crafts a universe where lesser novels promulgate excuses for sequels. All its rich elements are in balance and plausible—not the patchwork confederacy of made-up languages, contrived customs, and meaningless histories that are the hallmark of so many other, lesser novels.""[92]On November 5, 2019, theBBC NewslistedDuneon its list of the100 most influential novels.[93]J. R. R. Tolkienrefused to reviewDune, on the grounds that he disliked it ""with some intensity"" and thus felt it would be unfair to Herbert, another working author, if he gave an honest review of the book.[94]First edition prints and manuscripts[edit]Thefirst editionofDuneis one of the most valuable in science fictionbook collecting. Copies have been sold for more than $20,000 at auction.[95]California State University, Fullerton's Pollak Library has several of Herbert's draft manuscripts ofDuneand other works, with the author's notes, in their Frank Herbert Archives.[96]Sequels and prequels[edit]See also:Dune (franchise) § Development and publicationAfterDuneproved to be a critical and financial success for Herbert, he was able to devote himself full time to writing additional novels in the series. He had already drafted parts of the second and third while writingDune.[14]The series includedDune Messiah(1969),Children of Dune(1976),God Emperor of Dune(1981),Heretics of Dune(1984), andChapterhouse: Dune(1985), each sequentially continuing on the narrative fromDune. Herbert died on February 11, 1986.[97]Herbert's son,Brian Herbert, had found several thousand pages of notes left by his father that outlined ideas for other narratives related toDune. Brian Herbert enlisted authorKevin J. Andersonto help build outprequelnovels to the events ofDune. Brian Herbert's and Anderson'sDuneprequelsfirst started publication in 1999, and have led to additional stories that take place between those of Frank Herbert's books.[98]The notes for what would have beenDune 7also enabled them to publishHunters of Dune(2006) andSandworms of Dune(2007), sequels to Frank Herbert's final novelChapterhouse: Dune, which complete the chronological progression of his original series, and wrap up storylines that began inHeretics of Dune.Adaptations[edit]Further information:Dune (franchise) § In other mediaDunehas been considered an ""unfilmable"" and ""uncontainable"" work to adapt from novel to film or other visual medium.[99]Described byWired, ""It has four appendices and a glossary of its own gibberish, and its action takes place on two planets, one of which is a desert overrun by worms the size of airport runways. Lots of important people die or try to kill each other, and they're all tethered to about eight entangled subplots.""[100]There have been several attempts to achieve this difficult conversion with various degrees of success.[101]Early stalled attempts[edit]In 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed byArthur P. Jacobs) optioned therights to filmDune. As Jacobs was busy with other projects, such as the sequel toPlanet of the Apes,Dunewas delayed for another year. Jacobs' first choice for director wasDavid Lean, but he turned down the offer.Charles Jarrottwas also considered to direct. Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a director continued. Initially, the first treatment had been handled byRobert Greenhut, the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie in the first place, but subsequentlyRospo Pallenbergwas approached to write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974. However, Jacobs died in 1973.[102]Pre-release flyer for Jodorowsky'sDuneIn December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights from APJ, withAlejandro Jodorowskyset to direct.[103]In 1975, Jodorowsky planned to film the story as a 3-hour feature, set to star his own sonBrontis Jodorowskyin the lead role of Paul Atreides,Salvador DalíasShaddam IV, Padishah Emperor,Amanda LearasPrincess Irulan,Orson WellesasBaron Vladimir Harkonnen,Gloria SwansonasReverend MotherGaius Helen Mohiam,David CarradineasDuke Leto Atreides,Geraldine ChaplinasLady Jessica,Alain DelonasDuncan Idaho,Hervé VillechaizeasGurney Halleck,Udo Kieras Piter De Vries, andMick JaggerasFeyd-Rautha. It was at first proposed to score the film with original music byKarlheinz Stockhausen,Henry Cow, andMagma; later on, the soundtrack was to be provided byPink Floyd.[104]Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris consisting ofChris Foss, a British artist who designed covers for science fiction periodicals,Jean Giraud (Moebius), a French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew forMetal Hurlantmagazine, andH. R. Giger.[103]Moebius began designing creatures and characters for the film, while Foss was brought in to design the film's space ships and hardware.[103]Giger began designing the Harkonnen Castle based on Moebius'sstoryboards.Dan O'Bannonwas to head the special effects department.[103]Dalí was cast as the Emperor.[103]Dalí later demanded to be paid $100,000 per hour; Jodorowsky agreed, but tailored Dalí's part to be filmed in one hour, drafting plans for other scenes of the emperor to use a mechanical mannequin as substitute for Dalí.[103]According to Giger, Dalí was ""later invited to leave the film because of his pro-Francostatements"".[105]Just as the storyboards, designs, and script were finished, the financial backing dried up. Frank Herbert traveled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's script would result in a 14-hour movie (""It was the size of a phone book"", Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. Jodorowsky said in 1985 that he found theDunestory mythical and had intended to re-create it rather than adapt the novel; though he had an ""enthusiastic admiration"" for Herbert, Jodorowsky said he had done everything possible to distance the author and his input from the project.[103]Although Jodorowsky was embittered by the experience, he said theDuneproject changed his life, and some of the ideas were used in his and Moebius'sThe Incal.[106]O'Bannon entered a psychiatric hospital after the production failed, then worked on 13 scripts, the last of which becameAlien.[103]A 2013 documentary,Jodorowsky's Dune, was made about Jodorowsky's failed attempt at an adaptation.In 1976,Dino De Laurentiisacquired the rights from Gibon's consortium. De Laurentiis commissioned Herbert to write a new screenplay in 1978; the script Herbert turned in was 175 pages long, the equivalent of nearly three hours of screen time. De Laurentiis then hired directorRidley Scottin 1979, withRudy Wurlitzerwriting the screenplay and H. R. Giger retained from the Jodorowsky production; Scott and Giger had also just worked together on the filmAlien, after O'Bannon recommended the artist.[107][108]Scott intended to split the novel into two movies. He worked on three drafts of the script, usingThe Battle of Algiersas a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science fiction film,Blade Runner(1982). As he recalls, the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have been even more time-intensive:But after seven months I dropped out ofDune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer had come up with a first-draft script which I felt was a decent distillation of Frank Herbert's. But I also realisedDunewas going to take a lot more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him theDunescript was his.—FromRidley Scott: The Making of his Moviesby Paul M. SammonA draft of the screenplay for the Scott version was discovered in 2024 in theWheaton Collegearchives.[109]1984 film by David Lynch[edit]Main article:Dune (1984 film)In 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to theDunesequels (written and unwritten). After seeingThe Elephant Man, De Laurentiis' daughterRaffaelladecided thatDavid Lynchshould direct the movie. Around that time Lynch received several other directing offers, includingReturn of the Jedi. He agreed to directDuneand write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, was not familiar with the story, or even been interested in science fiction.[110]Lynch worked on the script for six months withEric Bergrenand Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the script before it split over creative differences. Lynch would subsequently work on five more drafts. Production of the work was troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film's timeline.[111]Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour-long film, but at demands fromUniversal Pictures, the film's distributor, he cut it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make up for some of the cut footage.[112]Thisfirst filmofDune, directed by Lynch, was released in 1984, nearly 20 years after the book's publication. Though Herbert said the book's depth and symbolism seemed to intimidate many filmmakers, he was pleased with the film, saying that ""They've got it. It begins asDunedoes. And I hear my dialogue all the way through. There are some interpretations and liberties, but you're gonna come out knowing you've seenDune.""[113]Reviews of the film were negative, saying that it was incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book, and that fans would be disappointed by the way it strayed from the book's plot.[99][114][115][116][117]Upon release for television and other forms of home media, Universal opted to reintroduce much of the footage that Lynch had cut, creating an over-three-hour-long version with extensive monologue exposition. Lynch was extremely displeased with this move, and demanded that Universal replace his name on these cuts with the pseudonym ""Alan Smithee"", and has generally distanced himself from the film since.[112]2000 miniseries by John Harrison[edit]Main article:Frank Herbert's DuneIn 2000,John Harrisonadapted the novel intoFrank Herbert's Dune, aminiseriesthat premiered on theSci-Fi Channel.[17]As of 2004, the miniseries was one of the three highest-rated programs broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel.[118]Further film attempts[edit]In 2008,Paramount Picturesannounced that they would produce a new film based on the book, withPeter Bergattached to direct.[119]ProducerKevin Misher, who spent a year securing the rights from the Herbert estate, was to be joined by Richard Rubinstein and John Harrison (of both Sci-Fi Channel miniseries) as well as Sarah Aubrey and Mike Messina.[119]The producers stated that they were going for a ""faithful adaptation"" of the novel and considered ""its theme of finite ecological resources particularly timely"".[119]Science fiction authorKevin J. Andersonand Frank Herbert's sonBrian Herbert, who had together written multipleDunesequelsandprequelssince 1999, were attached to the project as technical advisors.[120]In October 2009, Berg dropped out of the project, later saying that it ""for a variety of reasons wasn't the right thing"" for him.[121]Subsequently, with a script draft by Joshua Zetumer, Paramount reportedly sought a new director who could do the film for under $175 million.[122]In 2010,Pierre Morelwas signed on to direct, with screenwriter Chase Palmer incorporating Morel's vision of the project into Zetumer's original draft.[123][124]By November 2010, Morel left the project.[125]Paramount finally dropped plans for a remake in March 2011.[126]Films by Denis Villeneuve[edit]Main articles:Dune (2021 film)andDune: Part TwoIn November 2016,Legendary Entertainmentacquired the film and TV rights forDune.[127][128]Varietyreported in December 2016 thatDenis Villeneuvewas in negotiations to direct the project,[129]which was confirmed in February 2017.[130]In April 2017, Legendary announced thatEric Rothwould write the screenplay.[131]Villeneuve explained in March 2018 that his adaptation will be split into two films, with the first installment scheduled to begin production in 2019.[132]Casting includesTimothée Chalametas Paul Atreides,[133]Dave Bautistaas Rabban,Stellan Skarsgårdas Baron Harkonnen,[134]Rebecca Fergusonas Lady Jessica,[135]Charlotte Ramplingas Reverend Mother Mohiam,[136]Oscar Isaacas Duke Leto Atreides,[137]Zendayaas Chani,[138]Javier Bardemas Stilgar,[139]Josh Brolinas Gurney Halleck,[140]Jason Momoaas Duncan Idaho,[141]David Dastmalchianas Piter De Vries,[142]Chang Chenas Dr. Yueh,[143]andStephen HendersonasThufir Hawat.[144]Warner Bros. Picturesdistributed the film, which had its initial premiere on September 3, 2021, at theVenice Film Festival,[145]and wide release in both theaters and streaming onHBO Maxon October 21, 2021, as part of Warner Bros.' approach to handling the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemicon the film industry.[146][147]The film received ""generally favorable reviews"" onMetacritic.[148]It has gone on to win multiple awards and was named by theNational Board of Reviewas one of the 10 best films of 2021, as well as theAmerican Film Institutein their annual top 10 list.[149]The film went on to be nominated for tenAcademy Awards, winning six, the most wins of the night for any film in contention.[150]A sequel,Dune: Part Two, was scheduled for release on November 3, 2023,[151]but was released on March 1, 2024, due to the2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.[152]It had its world premiere at theOdeon Luxe Leicester Square, London, on February 15, 2024, and opened in the United States on March 1. It received critical acclaim especially for its visual effects and has grossed over $711 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossingfilm of 2024.Audiobooks[edit]In 1993,Recorded BooksInc. released a 20-discaudiobooknarrated byGeorge Guidall. In 2007,Audio Renaissancereleased an audio book narrated bySimon Vancewith some parts performed byScott Brick,Orlagh Cassidy,Euan Morton, and other performers.Cultural influence[edit]Dunehas been widely influential, inspiring numerous novels, music, films, television, games, and comic books.[153]It is considered one of the most influential science fiction novels of all time, with numerous modern science fiction works owing their existence toDune.[citation needed]Dunehas been referenced in numerous works ofpopular culture, includingStar Wars,Star Trek,Chronicles of Riddick,The Kingkiller ChronicleandFuturama.[154]Dunewas cited as a source of inspiration forHayao Miyazaki'sanimefilmNausicaä of the Valley of the Wind(1984) for its post-apocalyptic world.[155][156][157][158][159]Dunewas parodied in 1984'sNational Lampoon's DoonbyEllis Weiner, which William F. Touponce called ""something of a tribute to Herbert's success on college campuses"", noting that ""the only other book to have been so honored isTolkien'sThe Lord of the Rings,"" whichwas parodiedbyThe Harvard Lampoonin 1969.[160]Music[edit]In 1977,David Matthewsbecame one of the first artists to dedicate an entire composition toDune,publishing an album of the same name onCTI Records.[161]In 1978, Frenchelectronic musicianRichard Pinhasreleased the nine-trackDune-inspired albumChronolyse, which includes the seven-partVariations sur le thème des Bene Gesserit.[162]In 1979, German electronic music pioneerKlaus Schulzereleased an LP titledDunefeaturing motifs and lyrics inspired by the novel.[163]A similar musical project,Visions of Dune, was released also in 1979 by Zed (a pseudonym of French electronic musician Bernard Sjazner).[164]1981 FrenchzeuhlbandDünreleased their albumEroswhich was inspired by the Dune novel, also their band nameDünwas a short form from their temporary nameDune.[165]Heavy metal bandIron Maidenwrote the song ""To Tame a Land"" based on theDunestory. It appears as the closing track to their 1983 albumPiece of Mind. The original working title of the song was ""Dune""; however, the band was denied permission to use it, with Frank Herbert's agents stating ""Frank Herbert doesn't like rock bands, particularly heavy rock bands, and especially bands like Iron Maiden"".[166]Duneinspired the Germanhappy hardcorebandDune, who have released several albums with space travel-themed songs.[citation needed]The progressive hardcore bandShai Huludtook their name fromDune.[167]In 1988, New Zealand rock bandShihadchose their name based on ""Jihad"", the holy war scene from David Lynch's 1984 film.[168]""Traveller in Time"", from the 1991Blind GuardianalbumTales from the Twilight World, is based mostly on Paul Atreides' visions of future and past.[169][170]The title of the 1993Fear FactoryalbumFear is The Mindkilleris a quote from the ""litany against fear"".[171]The song ""Near Fantastica"", from the Matthew Good albumAvalanche, makes reference to the ""litany against fear"", repeating ""can't feel fear, fear's the mind killer"" through a section of the song.[172]In the Fatboy Slim song ""Weapon of Choice"", the line ""If you walk without rhythm/You won't attract the worm"" is a near quotation from the sections of novel in which Stilgar teaches Paul to ride sandworms.Christopher Walken, who would later star inDune: Part Twoas Emperor Shaddam IV, appears in the music video.[173]Dunealso inspired the 1999 albumThe 2nd Moonby the German death metal bandGolem, which is aconcept albumabout the series.[174]The song ""The Eyes of Ibad"" fromPanchiko's 2000 EPD>E>A>T>H>M>E>T>A>L, takes its name fromDune, referencing the blue-in-blue eyes of the Fremen.DuneinfluencedThirty Seconds to Marson theirself-titled debut album.[175]TheYoungblood Brass Band's song ""Is an Elegy"" onCenter:Level:Roarreferences ""Muad'Dib"", ""Arrakis"" and other elements from the novel.[176]The debut album of Canadian musicianGrimes, calledGeidi Primes, is a concept album based onDune.[177][178]In 2015, the Baltimore-based band Tendrills released a psych rock album called10,191.

Books,The_Bell_Jar,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Jar,The Bell Jar,"1963 novel by Sylvia PlathFor the scientific apparatus, seebell jar. For the 1979 film, seeThe Bell Jar(film).The Bell JarFirst edition cover, published under Sylvia Plath's pseudonym, ""Victoria Lucas"".AuthorSylvia PlathLanguageEnglishGenreRoman à clefPublisherHeinemannPublication date14 January 1963(1963-01-14)[1]Publication placeUnited StatesMedia typePrintPages244Dewey Decimal813.54LC ClassPS3566.L27 B4TextThe Bell JaronlineThe Bell Jaris the only novel written by the American writer and poetSylvia Plath. Originally published under the pseudonym ""Victoria Lucas"" in 1963, the novel is supposedly semi-autobiographical with the names of places and people changed. The book is often regarded as aroman à clefbecause the protagonist's descent into mental illness parallels Plath's experiences with what may have beenclinical depressionorbipolar II disorder. Plath died by suicide a month after its first United Kingdom publication.The novel was published under Plath's name for the first time in 1967. It was not published in the United States until 1971, in accordance with the wishes of both Plath's husbandTed Hughesand her mother.[2]In the United States, the book became an instant best seller, and has since been translated into nearly a dozen languages.[3]Synopsis[edit]In 1953, Esther Greenwood, a 19-year-old undergraduate student from the suburbs of Boston, is awarded a summer internship at the fictionalLadies' Daymagazine in New York City. During the internship, Esther feels neither stimulated nor excited by the work, fashion, and big-city lifestyle that her peers in the program seem to adore. She finds herself struggling to feel anything at all aside from anxiety and disorientation.Esther appreciates the witty sarcasm and adventurousness of Doreen, another intern, but she identifies with the piety of Betsy, an old-fashioned and naïve young woman. Esther has a benefactor in Philomena Guinea, a formerly successful writer of women's fiction, who funds the scholarship through which Esther – from a working-class family – is enrolled at her college.Esther describes in detail several seriocomic incidents that occur during her internship. In the beginning, she and Doreen meet Lenny, a gallant radio host who tries to seduce them, and who eventually dates Doreen. Another incident occurs with a mass food poisoning during a lunch thrown by the staff of the magazine.Much of the story is spent in flashbacks, where Esther reminisces about her boyfriend Buddy, whom she has dated more or less seriously, and who considers himself her fiancé. Esther's internal monologue often lingers on musings of death, violence, and the roles of women in her society.Shortly before the internship ends, she attends a country club party with Doreen, and she is set up with a wealthy Peruvian man named Marco who treats her roughly. Later, Marco takes her outside and tries to rape her; she breaks his nose and leaves. That night, after returning to the hotel, she impulsively throws all of her new and fashionable clothing off the roof.Esther returns to her Massachusetts home that she shares with her widowed mother. She has been hoping for another scholarly opportunity once she is back in Massachusetts, a writing course taught by a world-famous author, but on her return, she immediately is told by her mother that she was not accepted for the course and finds her plans derailed.She decides to spend the summer potentially writing a novel, but she feels she lacks enough life experience to write convincingly. All of her identity has been centered upon doing well academically; she is unsure of what to make of her life once she leaves school, and none of the choices presented to her (motherhood, as exemplified by the prolific child-bearer Dodo Conway, Esther's neighbor, or stereotypical female careers such asstenography) appeal to her.Esther increasingly becomes depressed, and she finds herself unable to sleep. Her mother instructs her to see Dr. Gordon, a psychiatrist, whom Esther mistrusts because he is attractive and does not seem to listen to her. He prescribeselectroconvulsive therapy(ECT); with her awake during the procedure, and leaving her fearful of ECT. Afterward, she tells her mother that she will not go back.The ECT is ineffective, and Esther's mental state worsens. She makes several half-hearted attempts at suicide, including swimming far out to sea, then she makes a serious attempt. Esther writes a note for her mother that she ""will go out on a long walk"", crawls into a well-hidden hole in the cellar, and swallows many of her mother's pills. The newspapers presume her kidnapping and death, but she is discovered alive under her house after an indeterminate amount of time.She is sent to several different mental hospitals until Philomena Guinea, her college benefactor, supports her stay at an elite treatment center where she meets Dr. Nolan, a female therapist. Along with regular psychotherapy sessions, Esther is givenhuge amounts of insulin to produce a ""reaction""(a common – and now disproven – psychiatric treatment at the time) and again receives ECT. Dr. Nolan ensures that they are properly administered.While there, she describes her depression as a feeling of being trapped under abell jar, struggling for breath. Eventually, Esther describes the ECT as beneficial in that it has a sort of antidepressant effect; it lifts the metaphorical bell jar in which she has felt trapped and stifled. While there, she becomes reacquainted with Joan Gilling, who also used to date Buddy. The novel heavily implies that Joan is  alesbianand that she is attracted to, or interested in, Esther, who finds her strange.Esther tells Dr. Nolan how she envies the freedom that men have and how she, as a woman, worries about getting pregnant. Dr. Nolan refers her to a doctor who fits her with adiaphragm. Esther now feels free from her fears about the consequences of sex; free from previous pressures to get married, potentially to the wrong man. Under Dr. Nolan, Esther improves.Various significant events, such as having sex for the first time, being hospitalized as a result, and Joan's suicide, provide her with a new perspective. Esther interacts with Buddy again toward the end of the novel when he visits her to ask if it was something about him that drove women to insanity, given that he dated both Joan and Esther. Buddy later wonders out loud who will marry Esther now that she has been hospitalized, effectively ending their commitment to get engaged. Esther feels relieved.The novel ends with Esther entering a conference with her doctors, who will decide whether she can leave the hospital and return to school.Characters[edit]Interior of a room at theBarbizon hotel(1942)Esther Greenwood, the protagonist of the story, is an ambitious English major from Boston. Having won a summer job as a ""guest editor"" forLadies' Daymagazine, she lives at theBarbizon hotel[4](referred to in the novel as the ""Amazon"" hotel) in New York City, along with the other young women who were selected as guest editors. Esther experiences increasing mental instability during her time in New York and over the following weeks. Her realization that she has no idea what she will do after graduation, combined with professional setbacks, social alienation, the trauma of narrowly avoiding being raped, and the feeling that she simply does not fit into the culturally acceptable role of womanhood, escalate Esther's emotional state of fear and panic. Though it is not immediately apparent, unresolved grief at the death of her father when she was 8 also affects her. Having returned to live with her mother in the Boston suburbs, and experiencing increasing insomnia, loss of appetite, and an inability to read or write, she becomes fixated on—and later attempts—suicide. Before her precipitous decline in mental health, Esther was known as a hardworking student, with an impressive record of excellent grades and a history of winning awards and recognition for her achievements. With the end of that era in sight, Esther is directionless, having only a vague idea she might go into publishing or become an author and poet. This existential quandary results in increasing self-absorption, leaving her prone to feeling detached and tired. She leaves her friend Doreen with a man they just met, after having been asked to stay to help protect her. Later, Doreen returns to the hotel, very drunk and asking for her. While Esther is helping Doreen to her room, Doreen vomits and passes out. Esther leaves her to sleep it off on the corridor floor, rather than deal with the resultant mess.Doreen, another guest editor atLadies' Daymagazine, is a daring and rebellious young woman, and Esther's best friend in New York. Esther finds Doreen's confident personality and free spirit appealing but troublesome, as she longs to be free of society's constraints, but fears the possible consequences. Esther admires Doreen's appearance, humor, personality, and even smell, which she describes as musky and sweet, like freshly crushed ferns. Ultimately, Esther's fear leads her to reject Doreen and resolve to have little more to do with her, choosing instead to befriend Betsy, a prototypical ""good girl"". However, after failing to be accepted into her desired writing program, Esther impulsively writes to Doreen to ask if she can stay with her, but seeing the deterioration of her handwriting frightens her and she never sends the letter.Joan, an old acquaintance of Esther, coincidentally ends up in the same mental hospital. Joan also had dated Buddy Willard, but tells Esther later that she was more interested in maintaining a relationship with Buddy's parents, whom she idealizes as more concerned and caring than—and therefore, superior to—her own. At the hospital, she and Esther engage in a quiet competition to recover first, an apparently common situation among the patients. Upon abruptly entering Joan's room, Esther finds her in bed with DeeDee, another female patient. Esther then reflects on other women she has known who have sex with women, wondering what motivates them. When Joan later makes an ambiguous overture to her, Esther cannot figure out whether it was a pass or a gesture of friendship. In response, Esther tells Joan she never has liked her. Later, when Esther hemorrhages  as a result of her first sexual experience, Joan helps her get to the emergency room. Joan eventually dies by suicide at the mental hospital. Esther attends her funeral.Doctor Nolanis Esther's doctor at the mental hospital. A beautiful and caring woman, her personal sensitivity and professional ability combine to make her the first woman in Esther's life with whom she feels she can fully connect. Nolan prescribes shock therapy and ensures that it is done correctly, which leads to positive results.Doctor Gordonis the first psychiatrist to treat Esther. Self-obsessed and patronizing, he subjects her to poorly administered electric shock treatments that traumatize Esther and utterly fail to help.Mrs. Greenwood, Esther's mother, loves her daughter, but is constantly urging Esther to mold herself into the societal ideal of white, middle-class womanhood—a goal for which Esther feels no desire at all.Buddy Willardis Esther's former boyfriend from her hometown. Studying to become a doctor, Buddy wants a wife who mirrors his mother, and hopes Esther will be that for him. Esther adores him throughout high school, but—upon learning that he is no longer a virgin—she loses respect for him and labels him a hypocrite. However, she feels compelled to postpone ending their relationship when Buddy is diagnosed with tuberculosis. He eventually proposes marriage, but Esther rejects his proposal, telling him that she has decided to never marry. Buddy is shocked and responds that Esther is crazy.Mrs. Willard, Buddy's mother, is a dedicated homemaker with strict, conservative views about both the proper social roles for women and what constitutes sexual propriety. She is set on Buddy and Esther marrying. Joan loves Mrs. Willard and feels that she is the mother Joan always wanted and never had.Mr. Willard, Buddy Willard's father and Mrs. Willard's husband, is a good friend of Esther's family.Constantin, asimultaneous interpreterat theUnited Nations, is an acquaintance of Mrs. Willard, who sets him up with a blind date with Esther while she is in New York. His alluring foreign accent and sophistication are very attractive to Esther, who contemplates giving her virginity to him when they return to his apartment. Puzzlingly, he chooses instead to spend the night sleeping chastely beside her.Irwinis a tall but rather ugly young man, who is the first man Esther has sex with, an initiation that causes her to hemorrhage. He is a ""very well-paid professor of mathematics"" on the make, and invites Esther to have coffee when they meet, unaware that she is on leave from a mental hospital. Unfortunately, penetrative sex with Irwin causes Esther to hemorrhage, a rare but not unheard of occurrence. As a result, he hastily pays for a cab and sends Esther ""home"".Jay Ceeis Esther's boss atLady's Day. She is very intelligent and capable, so ""her plug-ugly looks didn't seem to matter"".[5]She is responsible for editing Esther's work, which she does with a strictness that devastates Esther's self-esteem.Lenny Shepherd, a wealthy young man and disc jockey living in New York, invites Doreen and Esther for drinks while they are on their way to a party. They go together to his place. Doreen asks Esther to stay with her in case Lenny ""tries anything"", but Esther leaves. Doreen and Lenny start dating, taking Doreen away from Esther more often.Philomena Guinea, a wealthy, elderly lady, is the person who endowed Esther's college scholarship. Esther's college requires each girl who is on scholarship to write a letter to her benefactor, thanking him or her. Philomena invites Esther to have a meal with her and is taken with the student. Philomena had been committed at an earlier point in her life, and she insists on covering the cost of an expensive, private mental hospital for Esther, thus saving her from committal to a state-run institution. The inspiration for Philomena is believed to beOlive Higgins Prouty, an author who financially supported Plath before and after her stay in psychiatric care. Prouty struggled with mental breakdowns before meeting Plath, which may have been a direct reason for why she chose to pay for her scholarship.Marco, a Peruvian man and friend of Lenny Shepherd, is set up to take Esther to a party, and behavesmisogynistically. Reflecting on him, Esther muses that ""Women-haters were like gods: invulnerable and chock-full of power"".[6]He assaults her, and attempts to rape her.Betsy, another guest editor at the magazine, is a ""good"" girl from Kansas whom Esther strives to be more like. She serves as a foil to Doreen. Esther finds herself torn between daring to be like Doreen and wanting to emulate Betsy.Hilda, also a guest editor, arouses Esther's dislike with her callous attitude and cruel comments about theRosenbergsas they await imminent execution.Publication history[edit]According to her husband, Plath began writing the novel in 1961, after publishingThe Colossus, her first collection of poetry. Plath may have finished writing the novel in August 1961, although subsequent changes were made in the editing process.[7]After she separated from Hughes, Plath moved to a smaller flat in London, ""giving her time and place to work uninterruptedly. Then at top speed and with very little revision from start to finish she wroteThe Bell Jar,""[3]he explained.Plath was writing the novel under the sponsorship of the Eugene F. Saxton Fellowship, affiliated with publisherHarper & Row, but it was disappointed by the manuscript and withdrew, calling it ""disappointing, juvenile and overwrought"".[3]Early working titles of the novel includedDiary of a SuicideandThe Girl in the Mirror.[8]Upon publication in the United States on 14 April 1971 it became a runaway success, and featured inThe New York Times Best Sellers Listfor many consecutive weeks.[9]The novel was published as an audiobook read by actorMaggie Gyllenhaalin 2015 by Faber & Faber.[10]Style and major themes[edit]The novel is written using a series of flashbacks that reveal parts of Esther's past. The flashbacks primarily deal with Esther's relationship with Buddy Willard. The reader also learns more about her early college years.Womanhood and women's roles[edit]The Bell Jaraddresses the question of socially acceptable identity. It examines Esther's ""quest to forge her identity, to be herself rather than what others expect her to be.""[11]Esther is expected to become a housewife, and a self-sufficient woman, without the options to achieve independence.[8]Esther feels she is a prisoner to domestic duties and she fears the loss of her inner self.The Bell Jarsets out to highlight the problems with oppressive patriarchal society in mid-20th-century America.[12]Throughout the novel, Esther internally muses about sex, virginity, and the expectations on her as a woman therein. A major plot point in the later chapters is Esther being provided a contraceptive implant by a doctor, which allows her to lose her virginity without fear of falling pregnant and thus being expected to become a parent before her time.[13]Earlier in the novel, Esther criticizes the double standard of the expectation that she remains a virgin for Buddy (who intends to marry her), whilst Buddy was able to have a casual sexual relationship with another woman earlier in his life without consequence.Esther appears to take a near-scientific approach to sex and virginity. A chapter of the novel discusses Esther's plan to ""have an affair"" with someone, simply to ""get it over with"" (that is, to lose her virginity), but she is too fearful of the impact of pregnancy.Esther also remarks about her fear of marriage and the constraints a ""typical"" marriage of the era would have on her identity and personal goals.Mental health[edit]Illustration fromThe Cincinnati Post, June 12, 1971Esther describes her life as being suffocated by a bell jar. Abell jaris a thick glass container sometimes used to create a vacuum space. Here, it stands for ""Esther's mental suffocation by the unavoidable settling of depression upon her psyche"".[14]Throughout the novel, Esther talks of it suffocating her, and recognizes moments of clarity when it is lifted. These moments correlate to her mental state and the effect of her depression. Scholars argue about the nature of Esther's ""bell jar"" and what it can stand for.[14]Some say it is a retaliation against suburban lifestyle,[15]others believe it represents the standards set for a woman's life.[12]However, when considering the nature of Sylvia Plath's life and death and the parallels betweenThe Bell Jarand her life, it is hard to ignore the theme of mental illness.[16]PsychiatristAaron Beckstudied Esther's mental illness and notes two causes of depression evident in her life.[17]The first is formed from early traumatic experiences, her father's death when she was 9 years old. It is evident how affected she is by this loss when she wonders ""I thought how strange it had never occurred to me before that I was only purely happy until I was nine years old.""[18]The second cause of her depression is from her perfectionist ideologies. Esther is a woman of many achievements – college, internships and perfect grades. It is this success that puts the unattainable goals into her head, and when she does not achieve them, her mental health suffers. Esther laments, ""The trouble was, I had been inadequate all along, I simply hadn't thought about it.""[18]Esther Greenwood has an obvious mental break – that being her suicide attempt which dictates the latter half of the novel.[18]However, Esther's entire life shows warning signs that cause this depressive downfall. The novel begins with her negative thoughts surrounding all her past and current life decisions. It is this mindset mixed with the childhood trauma and perfectionist attitude that causes her descent that leads her to attempt suicide.[19]This novel gives an account of the treatment of mental health in the 1950s.[20]Plath speaks through Esther's narrative to describe her experience of her mental health treatment. Just as this novel gives way to feminist discourse and challenges the way of life for women in the 1950s, it also gives a case study of a woman struggling with mental health.[21]Parallels in Plath's life[edit]The book contains many references to real people and events in Plath's life. Plath's magazine scholarship was atMademoisellemagazine beginning in 1953.[22]Philomena Guinea is based on authorOlive Higgins Prouty, Plath's patron, who funded Plath's scholarship to study atSmith College. Plath was rejected from aHarvardcourse taught byFrank O'Connor.[23]Dr. Nolan is thought to be based onRuth Beuscher, Plath's therapist, whom she continued seeing after her release from the hospital. A good portion of this part of the novel closely resembles the experiences chronicled byMary Jane Wardin her autobiographical novelThe Snake Pit; Plath later stated that she had seen reviews ofThe Snake Pitand believed the public wanted to see ""mental health stuff"", so she deliberately based details of Esther's hospitalization on the procedures and methods outlined in Ward's book. Plath was a patient atMcLean Hospital,[24]an upscale facility which resembled the ""snake pit"" much less than wards in theMetropolitan State Hospital, which may have been where Mary Jane Ward was hospitalized.In a 2006 interview,Joanne Greenbergsaid that she had been interviewed in 1986 by one of the women who had worked onMademoisellewith Plath in the college guest editors group. The woman claimed that Plath had put so many details of the students' lives intoThe Bell Jarthat ""they could never look at each other again"", and that it had caused the breakup of her marriage and possibly others.[25][26]Janet McCann links Plath's search for female independence with a self-described neurotic psychology.[27]Ted Hughes, Plath's husband, suggested thatThe Bell Jarmight have been written as a response to many years of electroshock treatment and the scars it left.[28]Reception[edit]The Bell Jarreceived ""warily positive reviews"".[27]The short time span between the publication of the book and Plath's suicide resulted in ""few innocent readings"" of the novel.[8]The majority of early readers focused primarily on autobiographical connections from Plath to the protagonist. In response to autobiographical criticism, criticElizabeth Hardwickurged that readers distinguish between Plath as a writer and Plath as an ""event"".[8]Robert Scholes, writing forThe New York Times, praised the novel's ""sharp and uncanny descriptions"".[8][29]Mason Harris of theWest Coast Reviewcomplimented the novel as using ""the 'distorted lens' of madness [to give] an authentic vision of a period which exalted the most oppressive ideal of reason and stability.""[8]Howard MossofThe New Yorkergave a mixed review, praising the ""black comedy"" of the novel, but added that there was ""something girlish in its manner [that] betrays the hand of the amateur novelist"".[8]On November 5, 2019, theBBC NewslistedThe Bell Jaron its list of the100 most inspiring novels.[30]Legacy and adaptations[edit]Main article:The Bell Jar (film)The Bell Jarhas been referred to many times in popular media. Iris Jamahl Dunkle wrote of the novel that ""often, when the novel appears in American films and television series, it stands as a symbol for teenage angst.""[3]Larry Peerce'sThe Bell Jar(1979) starredMarilyn Hassettas Esther Greenwood, and featured the tagline: ""Sometimes just being a woman is an act of courage."" In the film, Joan attempts to get Esther to agree to a suicide pact, which does not occur in the book.In July 2016, it was announced thatKirsten Dunstwould be making her directorial debut with an adaptation ofThe Bell JarstarringDakota Fanningas Esther Greenwood.[31][32]In August 2019, it was announced Dunst was no longer attached, andBell Jarwill become a limited TV series from Showtime.[33]See also[edit]1963 in literatureReferences[edit]^McCrum, Robert (2015).""The 100 best novels: No 85 – The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath"".The Guardian.^McCullough, Frances (1996).

It follows the life experiences of Billy Pilgrim, from his early years, to his time as an American soldier and chaplain's assistant duringWorld War II, to thepost-waryears. Throughout the novel, Billy frequently travels back and forth through time. The protagonist deals with atemporal crisisas a result of his post-war psychological trauma. The text centers on Billy's capture by theGerman Armyand his survival of the Alliedfirebombing of Dresdenas aprisoner of war, an experience that Vonnegut endured as an American serviceman. The work has been called an example of ""unmatched moral clarity""[3]and ""one of the most enduring anti-war novels of all time"".[3]Plot[edit]The novel's first chapter begins with ""All this happened, more or less""; this introduction implies that anunreliable narratortells the story. Vonnegut utilizes a non-linear, non-chronological description of events to reflect Billy Pilgrim's psychological state. Events become clear throughflashbacksand descriptions oftime travelexperiences.[4]In the first chapter, the narrator describes his writing of the book, his experiences as aUniversity of Chicagoanthropology student and aChicago City News Bureaucorrespondent, his research on theChildren's Crusadeand the history of Dresden, and his visit toCold War–eraEuropewith his wartime friend Bernard V. O'Hare. In the second chapter, Vonnegut introduces Billy Pilgrim, an American man from the fictional town ofIlium, New York. Billy believes that an extraterrestrial species from the planetTralfamadoreheld him captive in an alien zoo and that he has experienced time travel.As a chaplain's assistant in theUnited States Armyduring World War II, Billy is an ill-trained, disoriented andfatalisticAmerican soldier who discovers that he does not like war and refuses to fight.[5]He is transferred from a base inSouth Carolinato the front line inLuxembourgduring theBattle of the Bulge. He narrowly escapes death as the result of a string of events. He also meets Roland Weary, a patriot, warmonger, and sadistic bully who derides Billy's cowardice. The two of them are captured in 1944 by the Germans, who confiscate all of Weary's belongings and force him to wear woodenclogsthat cut painfully into his feet; the resulting wounds becomegangrenous, which eventually kills him. While Weary is dying in a rail car full of prisoners, he convinces a fellow soldier, Paul Lazzaro, that Billy is to blame for his death. Lazzaro vows to avenge Weary's death by killing Billy, because revenge is ""the sweetest thing in life.""At this exact time, Billy becomes ""unstuck in time""; Billy travels through time to moments from his past and future. The novel describes the transportation of Billy and the other prisoners into Germany. The German soldiers held their prisoners in the German city ofDresden; the prisoners had to work in ""contract labor"" (forced labor); these events occurred in 1945. The Germans detained Billy and his fellow prisoners in an emptyslaughterhousecalledSchlachthof-fünf(""slaughterhouse five""). During the Alliedbombing of Dresden, German guards hid their captives in the partially underground setting of the slaughterhouse; this protected those captives from complete annihilation.  As a result, they are among the few survivors of thefirestormthat raged in the city between February 13 and 15, 1945. AfterV-E Dayin May 1945, Billy was transferred to the United States and received anhonorable dischargein July 1945.Billy is hospitalized with symptoms similar topost-traumatic stress disorderand placed under psychiatric care at aVeterans Affairs hospitalinLake Placid. During Billy's stay at the hospital,Eliot Rosewaterintroduces him to the work of an obscure science fiction writer namedKilgore Trout.  After his release, Billy marries Valencia Merble, whose father owns the Ilium School of Optometry that Billy later attends. Billy becomes a successful and wealthyoptometrist. In 1947, Billy and Valencia conceive their first child, Robert, on theirhoneymooninCape Ann, Massachusetts. Two years later, their second child, Barbara, was born. On Barbara's wedding night, Billy isabductedby aflying saucerand taken to a planet many light-years away from Earth called Tralfamadore. TheTralfamadorianshave the power to see infour dimensions; they simultaneously observe all points in thespace-time continuum. They universally adopt afatalisticworldview: death means nothing to them, and their typical response to hearing about death is ""so it goes.""The Tralfamadorians transport Billy to Tralfamadore and place him inside a transparentgeodesic domeexhibit in a zoo; the inside resembles a house on planet Earth. The Tralfamadorians later abduct a pornographic film star named Montana Wildhack, who had disappeared on Earth and supposedly drowned inSan Pedro Bay. The Tralfamadorians intend to have her mate with Billy. Montana and Billy fall in love and have a child together. Billy is instantaneously sent back to Earth in a time warp to re-live past or future moments of his life.In 1968, Billy and a co-pilot are the only survivors of a plane crash in Vermont. While driving to visit Billy in the hospital, Valencia crashes her car and dies ofcarbon monoxide poisoning. Billy shares a hospital room with Bertram Rumfoord, aHarvard Universityhistory professor researching anofficial war historyof theUSAAFin World War II. They discuss the bombing of Dresden, which the professor initially refuses to believe Billy witnessed. Despite the significant loss of civilian life and the destruction of Dresden, they both regard the bombing as a justifiable act.Billy's daughter takes him home to Ilium. He escapes and flees toNew York City. InTimes Squarehe visits a pornographic book store, where he discovers books written by Kilgore Trout and reads them. He discovers a science fiction novel titledThe Big Boardat the bookstore.The novel is about a couple abducted by extraterrestrials. The aliens trick the abductees into thinking they are managing investments on Earth, which excites the humans and, in turn, sparks interest in the observers. He also finds some magazine covers that mention Montana Wildhack's disappearance. While Billy surveys the bookstore, one of Montana's pornographic films plays in the background. Later in the evening, when he discusses his time travels to Tralfamadore on aradio talk show, he is ejected from the studio. He returns to his hotel room, falls asleep, and time-travels back to 1945 in Dresden. Billy and his fellow prisoners are tasked with locating and burying the dead. After aMaoriNew Zealandsoldier working with Billy dies ofdry heavesthe Germans begin cremating the bodies en masse withflamethrowers. German soldiers execute Billy's friend Edgar Derby for stealing a teapot. Eventually all of the German soldiers leave to fight on theEastern Front, leaving Billy and the other prisoners alone with tweeting birds as the war ends.Through non-chronological storytelling, other parts of Billy's life are told throughout the book. After Billy is evicted from the radio studio, Barbara treats Billy as a child and often monitors him. Robert becomes starklyanti-communist, enlists as aGreen Beretand fights in theVietnam War. Billy is eventually killed in 1976, at which point the United States has been partitioned into twenty countries and attacked byChinawiththermonuclear weapons. He gives a speech in abaseball stadiuminChicagoin which he predicts his own death and proclaims that ""if you think death is a terrible thing, then you have not understood a word I've said."" Billy soon after is shot with a laser gun by an assassin commissioned by the elderly Lazzaro.Characters[edit]A 1965 photograph of Vonnegut byBernard GotfrydNarrator: Recurring as a minor character, the narrator seems anonymous while also clearly identifying himself asKurt Vonnegut, when he says, ""That was I. That was me. That was the author of this book.""[6]As noted above, as an American soldier during World War II, Vonnegut was captured by Germans at theBattle of the Bulgeand transported to Dresden. He and fellow prisoners-of-war survived the bombing while being held in a deep cellar ofSchlachthof Fünf(""Slaughterhouse-Five"").[7]The narrator begins the story by describing his connection to the firebombing of Dresden and his reasons for writingSlaughterhouse-Five.Billy Pilgrim: A fatalistic optometrist ensconced in a dull, safe marriage in Ilium, New York. During World War II, he was held as aprisoner-of-warin Dresden and survived the firebombing, experiences which had a lasting effect on his post-war life. His time travel occurs at desperate times in his life; he relives past and future events and becomes fatalistic (though not a defeatist) because he claims to have seen when, how and why he will die.Roland Weary: A weak man dreaming of grandeur and obsessed with gore and vengeance, who saves Billy several times (despite Billy's protests) in hopes of attaining military glory. He coped with his unpopularity in his home city ofPittsburghby befriending and then beating people less well-liked than him, and is obsessed with his father's collection of torture equipment. Weary is also a bully who beats Billy and gets them both captured, leading to the loss of his winter uniforms and boots. Weary dies of gangrene on the train en route to the POW camp, and blames Billy in his dying words.Paul Lazzaro: Another POW. A sickly, ill-temperedcar thieffromCicero, Illinoiswho takes Weary's dying words as a revenge commission to kill Billy. He keeps a mental list of his enemies, claiming he can have anyone ""killed for a thousand dollars plus traveling expenses."" Lazzaro eventually fulfills his promise to Weary and has Billy assassinated by a laser gun in 1976.Kilgore Trout: A failed science fiction writer whose hometown is also Ilium, New York, and who makes money by managingnewspaper delivery boys. He has received only onefan letter(from Eliot Rosewater; see below). After Billy meets him in a back alley in Ilium, he invites Trout to his wedding anniversary celebration. There, Kilgore follows Billy, thinking the latter has seen through a ""time window."" Kilgore Trout is also a main character in Vonnegut's 1973 novelBreakfast of Champions.Edgar Derby: A middle-aged high school teacher who felt that he needed to participate in the war rather than just send off his students to fight. One of his sons is serving with the marines in thePacific Theatre. Though relatively unimportant, Derby seems to be the only American before the bombing of Dresden to understand what war can do to people. During Campbell's presentation he stands up and castigates him, defendingAmerican democracyand thealliance with the Soviet Union. German forces summarily execute him for looting after they catch him taking a teapot from catacombs after the bombing. The undamaged teapot is identical to one he has at home, and it is his astonishment at the find amongst the rubble, that gives him away to the guards. Vonnegut has said that this death is the climax of the book as a whole.Howard W. Campbell Jr.: An American-born Nazi. Before the war, he lived in Germany where he was a notedGerman-languageplaywright recruited by theNazi Ministry of Propaganda. In an essay, he connects the misery ofAmerican povertyto the disheveled appearance and behavior of the American POWs. Edgar Derby confronts him when Campbell tries to recruit American POWs into theAmerican Free Corpsto fight the CommunistSoviet Unionon behalf of the Nazis. He appears wearingswastika-adornedcowboy hatandbootsand with a red, white and blue Nazi armband. Campbell is theprotagonistof Vonnegut's 1962 novelMother Night.Valencia Merble: Billy's wife and the mother of their children, Robert and Barbara. Billy is emotionally distant from her. She dies from carbon monoxide poisoning after an automobile accident en route to the hospital to see Billy after his airplane crash.Robert Pilgrim: Son of Billy and Valencia. A troubled, middle-class boy and disappointing son who becomes analcoholicat age 16, drops out of high school, and is arrested for vandalizing a Catholic cemetery. He later so absorbs theanti-Communistworldview that he metamorphoses from suburban adolescent rebel toGreen Beretsergeant. He wins aPurple Heart,Bronze StarandSilver Starin the Vietnam War.Barbara Pilgrim: Daughter of Billy and Valencia. She is a ""bitchy flibbertigibbet"" from having had to assume the family's leadership at the age of twenty. She has ""legs like anEdwardiangrand piano,"" marries an optometrist, and treats her widowed father as a childish invalid.Tralfamadorians: The race of extraterrestrial beings who appear (to humans) like upright toilet plungers with a hand atop, in which is set a single green eye. They abduct Billy and teach him about time's relation to the world (as a fourth dimension), fate, and the nature of death. The Tralfamadorians are featured in several Vonnegut novels. InSlaughterhouse Five, they reveal that the universe will be accidentally destroyed by one of their test pilots, and there is nothing they can do about it.Montana Wildhack: A beautiful young model who is abducted and placed alongside Billy in the zoo on Tralfamadore. She and Billy develop an intimate relationship and they have a child. She apparently remains on Tralfamadore with the child after Billy is sent back to Earth. Billy sees her in a film showing in a pornographic book store when he stops to look at the Kilgore Trout novels sitting in the window. Her unexplained disappearance is featured on the covers of magazines sold in the store.""Wild Bob"": A superannuated army officer Billy meets in the war. He tells his fellow POWs to call him ""Wild Bob"", as he thinks they are the 451st Infantry Regiment and under his command. He explains ""If you're ever inCody, Wyoming, ask for Wild Bob"", which is a phrase that Billy repeats to himself throughout the novel. He dies of pneumonia.Eliot Rosewater: Billy befriends him in the veterans' hospital; he introduces Billy to the sci-fi novels of Kilgore Trout. Rosewater wrote the only fan letter Trout ever received. Rosewater had also suffered a terrible event during the war. Billy and Rosewater find the Trout novels helpful in dealing with the trauma of war. Rosewater is featured in other Vonnegut novels, such asGod Bless You, Mr. Rosewater(1965).Bertram Copeland Rumfoord: A Harvard history professor, retiredU.S. Air Forcebrigadier general, and millionaire. He shares a hospital room with Billy and is interested in the Dresden bombing. He is in the hospital after breaking his leg on his honeymoon with his fifth wife Lily, a barely literatehigh school drop-outandgo-go girl. He is described as similar in appearance and mannerisms toTheodore Roosevelt. Bertram is likely a relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, a character in Vonnegut's 1959 novelThe Sirens of Titan.The Scouts: Two American infantry scouts trapped behind German lines who find Roland Weary and Billy. Roland refers to himself and the scouts as the ""Three Musketeers"". The scouts abandon Roland and Billy because the latter are slowing them down. They are revealed to have been shot and killed by Germans in ambush.Bernard V. O'Hare: The narrator's old war friend who was also held in Dresden and accompanies him there after the war. He is the husband of Mary O'Hare, and is adistrict attorneyfromPennsylvania.Mary O'Hare: The wife of Bernard V. O'Hare, to whom Vonnegut promised to name the bookThe Children's Crusade. She is briefly discussed in the beginning of the book. When the narrator and Bernard try to recollect their war experiences Mary complains that they were just ""babies"" during the war and that the narrator will portray them as valorous men. The narrator befriends Mary by promising that he will portray them as she said and that in his book ""there won't be a part forFrank SinatraorJohn Wayne.""Werner Gluck: The sixteen-year-old German charged with guarding Billy and Edgar Derby when they are first placed at Slaughterhouse Five in Dresden. He does not know his way around and accidentally leads Billy and Edgar into acommunal showerwhere someGerman refugeegirls fromBreslauare bathing. He is described as appearing similar to Billy.Style[edit]In keeping with Vonnegut's signature style, the novel's syntax and sentence structure are simple, andirony,sentimentality,black humor, anddidacticismare prevalent throughout the work.[8]Like much of his oeuvre,Slaughterhouse-Fiveis broken into small pieces, and in this case, into brief experiences, each focused on a specific point in time. Vonnegut has noted that his books ""are essentially mosaics made up of a whole bunch of tiny little chips...and each chip is a joke."" Vonnegut also includes hand-drawn illustrations inSlaughterhouse-Five, and also in his next novel,Breakfast of Champions(1973). Characteristically, Vonnegut makes heavy use of repetition, frequently using the phrase, ""So it goes"". He uses it as a refrain when events of death, dying, and mortality occur or are mentioned; as a narrative transition to another subject; as amemento mori; ascomic relief; and to explain the unexplained. The phrase appears 106 times.[9]The book has been categorized  as apostmodern,meta-fictionalnovel. The first chapter ofSlaughterhouse-Fiveis written in the style of an author'sprefaceabout how he came to write the novel. The narrator introduces the novel's genesis by telling of his connection to the Dresden bombing, and why he is recording it. He provides a description of himself and of the book, saying that it is a desperate attempt at creating a scholarly work. He ends the first chapter by discussing the beginning and end of the novel. He then segues to the story of Billy Pilgrim: ""Listen: Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time"", thus the transition from the writer's perspective to that of the third-person, omniscient narrator. (The use of ""Listen"" as an opening interjection has been said to mimic the opening ""Hwaet!"" of the medieval epic poemBeowulf.) The fictional ""story"" appears to begin in Chapter Two, although there is no reason to presume that the first chapter is not also fiction. This technique is common in postmodern meta-fiction.[10]The narrator explains that Billy Pilgrim experiences his life discontinuously, so that he randomly lives (and re-lives) his birth, youth, old age and death, rather than experiencing them in the normal linear order. There are two main narrative threads: a description of Billy's World War II experience, which, though  interrupted by episodes from other periods and places in his life, is mostly linear; and a description of his discontinuous pre-war and post-war lives. A main idea is that Billy's existential perspective had been compromised by his having witnessed Dresden's destruction (although he had come ""unstuck in time"" before arriving in Dresden).[11]Slaughterhouse-Fiveis told in short, declarative sentences, which create the impression that one is reading a factual report.[12]The first sentence says, ""All this happened, more or less."" (In 2010, the line was ranked No. 38 on theAmerican Book Review's list of ""100 Best First Lines from Novels"".)[13]The opening sentences of the novel have been said to contain the aesthetic ""method statement"" of the entire novel.[14]Themes[edit]War and death[edit]InSlaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut attempts to come to terms with war through the narrator's eyes, Billy Pilgrim. An example within the novel, showing Vonnegut's aim to accept his past war experiences, occurs in chapter one, when he states that ""All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his. Another guy I knew really did threaten to have his personal enemies killed by hired gunmen after the war. And so on. I've changed all the names.""[15]As the novel continues, it is relevant that the reality is death.[16]Slaughterhouse-Fivefocuses on human imagination while interrogating the novel's overall theme, which is the catastrophic impact that war leaves behind.[17]Death is something that happens fairly often inSlaughterhouse-Five.When a death occurs in the novel, Vonnegut marks the occasion with the saying ""so it goes."" Bergenholtz and Clark write about what Vonnegut actually means when he uses that saying: ""Presumably, readers who have not embraced Tralfamadoriandeterminismwill be both amused and disturbed by this indiscriminate use of 'So it goes.' Such humor is, of course, black humor.""[18]Religion and philosophy[edit]Christian philosophy[edit]Christian philosophy is present in Vonnegut'sSlaughterhouse-Five, though not generally in a well-regarded manner. When God and Christianity is brought up in the work, it is often mentioned in a bitter or disregarding tone, particularly with regard to how the soldiers react to the mention of it. Though Billy Pilgrim had adopted some part of Christianity, he did not ascribe to all of it. JC Justus summarizes it the best when he mentions that, ""'Tralfamadorian determinism and passivity' that Pilgrim later adopts as well as Christian fatalism wherein God himself has ordained the atrocities of war..."".[19]Following Justus's argument, Pilgrim was a character that had been through war and traveled through time. Having experienced all of these horrors in his lifetime, Pilgrim ended up adopting the Christian ideal that God had everything planned and he had given his approval for the war to happen.Tralfamadorian philosophy[edit]As Billy Pilgrim becomes ""unstuck in time"", he is faced with a new type of philosophy. Upon making acquaintance with the Tralfamadorians, he learns a different viewpoint concerning fate and free will. While Christianity may state that fate and free will are matters of God's divine choice and human interaction, Tralfamadorianism would disagree. According to Tralfamadorian philosophy, things are and always will be, and there is nothing that can change them. When Billy asks why they had chosenhim, the Tralfamadorians reply, ""Whyyou? Whyusfor that matter? Whyanything? Because this moment simply is.""[20]The mindset of the Tralfamadorian is not one in which free will exists. Things happen because they were always destined to be happening. The narrator of the story explains that the Tralfamadorians see time all at once. This concept of time is best explained by the Tralfamadorians themselves, as they speak to Billy Pilgrim on the matter stating, ""I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as you might see a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simplyis.""[21]After this particular conversation on seeing time, Billy makes the statement that this philosophy does not seem to evoke any sense of free will. To this, the Tralfamadorian reply that free will is a concept that, out of the ""visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe"" and ""studied reports on one hundred more,"" ""only on Earth is there any talk of free will.""[21]Using the Tralfamadorian passivity of fate,  Pilgrim learns to overlook death and the shock involved with death. He claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he onlyappearsto die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. ... When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is ""So it goes.""[22]Postmodernism[edit]The significance ofpostmodernismis a reoccurring theme in Vonnegut's works. Postmodernism arose as a rejection ofmodernistnarratives and structures. According to one critic, Tralfamadorianism is a restatement of Christian teleology: There is no purpose to life, effects do not have causes; the only reason for anything is that God has ordained it. This juxtaposition is displayed throughout the book, rather directly asking the reader to confront the logical absurdities inherent in both Christian faith and Tralfamadorianism. The rigid and dogmatic approach of Christianity is dismissed, while determinism is critiqued.[23]Mental illness[edit]Some have argued that Vonnegut is speaking out for veterans, many of whose post-war states are untreatable. Pilgrim's symptoms have been identified as what is now calledpost-traumatic stress disorder, which didn't exist as a term when the novel was written. In the words of one writer, ""perhaps due to the fact that PTSD was not officially recognized as a mental disorder yet, the establishment fails Billy by neither providing an accurate diagnosis nor proposing any coping mechanisms.""[24]Billy found life meaningless due to his experiences in the war, which desensitized  and forever changed him.[25]Symbols[edit]Dresden[edit]TheAlter Schlachthof(Old Slaughterhouse) where Vonnegut sheltered from the bombing of Dresden.[26]Vonnegut was in the city of Dresden when it was bombed; he came home traumatized and unable to properly communicate the horror of what happened there.Slaughterhouse-Fiveis the product of the twenty years of work it took for him to articulate the experience in a way that satisfied him. William Allen says, ""Precisely  because the story was so hard to tell, and because Vonnegut was willing to take two decades necessary to tell it – to speak the unspeakable –Slaughterhouse-Fiveis a great novel, a masterpiece sure to remain a permanent part of American literature.""[27]Food[edit]Billy Pilgrim ended up owning ""half of three Tastee-Freeze stands. Tastee-Freeze was a sort of frozen custard. It gave all the pleasure that ice cream could give, without the stiffness and bitter coldness of ice cream"" (61). ThroughoutSlaughterhouse-Five, when Billy is eating or near food, he thinks of food in positive terms. This is partly because food is both a status symbol and comforting to people in Billy's situation. ""Food may provide nourishment, but its more important function is to soothe... Finally, food also functions as a status symbol, a sign of wealth. For instance, en route to the German prisoner-of-war camp, Billy gets a glimpse of the guards' boxcar and is impressed by its contents... In sharp contrast, the Americans' boxcar proclaims their dependent prisoner-of-war status.""[18]The Bird[edit]Throughout the novel, the bird sings ""Poo-tee-weet?"" After the Dresden firebombing, the bird breaks out in song. The bird also sings outside of Billy's hospital window. The song has been interpreted as symbolizing a loss of words, or the inadequacy of words to describe traumatic situations.[28]Allusions and references[edit]Allusions to other works[edit]As in other novels by Vonnegut,certain characters cross over from other stories, makingcameo appearancesand connecting the discrete novels to a greater opus. Fictional novelistKilgore Trout, often an important character in other Vonnegut novels, is a social commentator and a friend to Billy Pilgrim inSlaughterhouse-Five. In one case, he is the only non-optometristat a party; therefore, he is the odd man out. He ridicules everything the Ideal American Family holds true, such as Heaven, Hell, and Sin. In Trout's opinion, people do not know if the things they do turn out to be good or bad, and if they turn out to be bad, they go to Hell, where ""the burning never stops hurting."" Other crossover characters areEliot Rosewater, fromGod Bless You, Mr. Rosewater; Howard W. Campbell Jr., fromMother Night; and Bertram Copeland Rumfoord, relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, fromThe Sirens of Titan. While Vonnegut re-uses characters, the characters are frequentlyrebootedand do not necessarily maintain the same biographical details from appearance to appearance. Trout in particular is palpably a different person (although with distinct, consistent character traits) in each of his appearances in Vonnegut's work.[29]In theTwayne's United States Authorsseries volume on Kurt Vonnegut, about the protagonist's name, Stanley Schatt says:By naming the unheroic hero Billy Pilgrim, Vonnegut contrastsJohn Bunyan's ""Pilgrim's Progress"" with Billy's story. As Wilfrid Sheed has pointed out, Billy's solution to the problems of the modern world is to ""invent a heaven, out of 20th century materials, where Good Technology triumphs over Bad Technology. His scripture is Science Fiction, Man's last, good fantasy"".[30]The city in which the novel is set,Ilium, New York, is another allusion. This city appears in many of his books.Cultural and historical allusions[edit]Slaughterhouse-Fivemakes numerous cultural, historical, geographical, and philosophical allusions. It tells of thebombing of Dresden in World War II, and refers to theBattle of the Bulge, theVietnam War, and thecivil rights protestsin American cities during the 1960s. Billy's wife, Valencia, has a ""Reagan for President!""bumper stickeron herCadillac, referring toRonald Reagan's failed1968 Republican presidential nominationcampaign. Another bumper sticker is mentioned, reading ""ImpeachEarl Warren,"" referencing a real-life campaign by thefar-rightJohn Birch Society.[31][32][33]TheSerenity Prayerappears twice.[34]CriticTony Tannersuggested that it is employed to illustrate the contrast between Billy Pilgrim's and the Tralfamadorians' views offatalism.[35]Richard Hinchcliffe contends that Billy Pilgrim could be seen at first as typifying theProtestant work ethic, but he ultimately converts toevangelicalism.[36]Vonnegut's own experiences[edit]In 1995, Vonnegut said that Billy Pilgrim was modeled on Edward ""Joe"" Crone, a thin soldier who died in Dresden. Vonnegut had told this to friends earlier, but waited until after he learned that both of Crone's parents were deceased to publicly disclose this information.[37][38]Edgar Derby, killed for looting a teapot, was modeled on Vonnegut's fellow prisoner Mike Palaia, who was executed for plundering a jar of food (variously described as beans, fruit, or cherries).[39][40]Reception[edit]The reviews ofSlaughterhouse-Fivehave been largely positive since the March 31, 1969 review in theNew York Timesstated: ""you'll either love it, or push it back in the science-fiction corner.""[41]It was Vonnegut's first novel to become a bestseller, staying on theNew York Timesbestseller listfor sixteen weeks and peaking at No. 4.[42]In 1970,Slaughterhouse-Fivewas nominated for best-novelNebulaandHugoAwards. It lost both toThe Left Hand of DarknessbyUrsula K. Le Guin. It has since been widely regarded as a classic anti-war novel, and has appeared inTimemagazine's list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923.[43]Censorship controversy[edit]Slaughterhouse-Fivehas been the subject of many attempts atcensorshipdue to its irreverent tone, purportedly obscene content and depictions of sex, American soldiers' use of profanity, and perceived heresy. It was one of the first literary acknowledgments thathomosexual men, referred to in the novel as ""fairies"", were among the victims of theHolocaust.[44]In the United States it has at times been banned from literature classes, removed fromschool libraries, and struck from literary curricula.[45]In 1972, following the ruling ofTodd v. Rochester Community Schools, it was banned fromRochester Community SchoolsinOakland County, Michigan.[46]The circuit judge described the book as ""depraved, immoral, psychotic, vulgar and anti-Christian.""[44]It was later reinstated.[47]In 1973, Vonnegut learned of a school district in North Dakota that was antagonistic towardsSlaughterhouse-Five. An English teacher at a high school in the district wanted to read the novel with their class. Charles McCarthy, the head of the school board, declared the novel inappropriate because of obscene language. All copies of Vonnegut's novel in the school were burned in a furnace.[48]In a letter to McCarthy in 1973, Vonnegut defended his credibility, his character, and his work. In the letter, entitled ""I Am Very Real"", Vonnegut wrote that his books ""beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are"". He contended that his work should not be censored based on the general message in the novel.[49][48]TheU.S. Supreme Courtconsidered theFirst Amendmentimplications of the removal of the book, among others, frompublic school librariesin the case ofIsland Trees School District v. Pico,457U.S.853(1982) and concluded that ""local school boards may not remove books from school library shelves simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books and seek by their removal to 'prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion.'""Slaughterhouse-Fiveis the sixty-seventh entry to theAmerican Library Association's list of the ""Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–1999"" and number forty-six on the ALA's ""Most Frequently Challenged Books of 2000–2009"".[45]In August 2011, the novel was banned at the Republic High School inMissouri. The Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library countered by offering 150 free copies of the novel to Republic High School students on a first-come, first-served basis.[50]In an effort to comply with a new 2024Tennesseestate law which added to the 2022 Age Appropriate Materials Act,Slaughterhouse-Fivewas banned - along with nearly 400 other titles - at the discretion of middle and high school librarians servingWilson County Schools, a public school district in the greater metropolitanNashvillearea.[51][52][53]It has also been recently banned from school libraries in the state of Florida.[54]In 2024 the book was banned in Texas by the Katy Independent School District on the basis that the novel is ""adopting, supporting, or promoting gender fluidity""[55]despite also pronouncing a bullying policy that protects infringements on the rights of the student.[56]Criticism[edit]Slaughterhouse-Fivehas been described as aquietistwork, because Billy Pilgrim believes that the notion of free will is a quaint Earthling illusion.[57]According to Robert Merrill and Peter A. Scholl, ""Vonnegut's critics seem to think that he is saying the same thing [as the Tralfamadorians]."" ForAnthony Burgess, ""Slaughterhouseis a kind of evasion—in a sense, likeJ. M. Barrie'sPeter Pan—in which we're being told to carry the horror of the Dresden bombing, and everything it implies, up to a level of fantasy..."" For Charles Harris, ""The main idea emerging fromSlaughterhouse-Fiveseems to be that the proper response to life is one of resigned acceptance."" ForAlfred Kazin, ""Vonnegut deprecates any attempt to see tragedy, that day, in Dresden...He likes to say, with arch fatalism, citing one horror after another, 'So it goes.'"" For Tanner, ""Vonnegut has...total sympathy with such quietistic impulses."" The same notion is found throughoutThe Vonnegut Statement, a book of original essays written and collected by Vonnegut's most loyal academic fans.[57]When confronted with the question of how the desire to improve the world fits with the notion of time presented inSlaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut responded ""you understand, of course, that everything I say is horseshit.""[58]Adaptations[edit]Afilm adaptationof the book was released in1972. Although critically praised, the film was a box office flop. It won thePrix du Juryat the 1972Cannes Film Festival, as well as aHugo AwardandSaturn Award. Vonnegut commended the film greatly. In 2013,Guillermo del Toroannounced his intention to remake the 1972 film and work with a script byCharlie Kaufman.[59]In 1989, a theatrical adaptation was performed at theEveryman Theatre, inLiverpool,England.[60]In 1996, another theatrical adaptation of the novel premiered at theSteppenwolf Theatre CompanyinChicago. The adaptation was written and directed byEric Simonsonand featured actors Rick Snyder,Robert BreulerandDeanna Dunagan.[61]The play has subsequently been performed in several other theaters, including a New York premiere production in January 2008, by the Godlight Theatre Company. Anoperaticadaptation byHans-Jürgen von Bosepremiered in July 1996 at theBavarian State OperainMunich,Germany. Billy Pilgrim II was sung by Uwe Schonbeck.[62]In September 2009,BBC Radio 3broadcast a feature-lengthradio dramabased on the book, which was dramatised byDave Sheasby, featuredAndrew Scottas Billy Pilgrim and was scored by the group65daysofstatic.[63]In September 2020, a graphic novel adaptation of the book, written byRyan Northand drawn byAlbert Monteys, was published byBOOM! Studios, through theirArchaia Entertainmentimprint. It was the first time the book has been adapted into the comics medium.[64]See also[edit]Four dimensionalismReferences[edit]^Strodder, Chris (2007).The Encyclopedia of Sixties Cool.

In the novel, the society has taken away pain and strife by converting to ""Sameness"", a plan that has also eradicatedemotionaldepth from their lives. In an effort to preserve order, the society has a true sense of equality and lacks any color, climate, or terrain. The protagonist of the story, a 12-year-old boy named Jonas, is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory, the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness. Jonas struggles with concepts of the new emotions and things introduced to him, and whether they are inherently good, evil, or in between, and whether it is possible to have one without the other.[1]The Giverwon the 1994Newbery Medaland has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide.[2]A 2012 survey bySchool Library Journaldesignated it as the fourth-best children's novel of all time.[3]It has been the subject of a large body of scholarly analysis, with academics considering themes of memory, religion, color, eugenics and utopia within the novel. In Australia, Canada, and the United States, it is required on manycore curriculumreading lists inmiddle school,[4]but it is also frequentlychallenged. It ranked #11 on theAmerican Library Associationlist of the most challenged books of the 1990s,[5]ranked #23 in the 2000s,[6]and ranked #61 in the 2010s.[7]The novel is the first in a loose quartet of novels known asThe Giver Quartet, with three subsequent books set in the same universe:Gathering Blue(2000),Messenger(2004), andSon(2012).[8]In 2014, afilm adaptationwas released, starringJeff Bridges,Meryl Streep, andBrenton Thwaitesand directed byPhilip Noyce.[9]PlotJonas, a 12-year-old boy, lives in a community isolated from all except a few similar towns, where everyone has an assigned role. With the annual Ceremony of Twelve upcoming, he is nervous, for there he will be assigned his life's work. He seeks reassurance from his father, a Nurturer (who cares for the infants in the Community) and his mother, an official in the Department of Justice. He is told that the Elders, who assign the children their careers, are always right.The day finally arrives, and Jonas is assembled with his classmates in order of birth. The Chief Elder, who presides, does not call Jonas when it is his turn, to the boy's increasing anxiety. After everyone else has been called, the Chief Elder explains that Jonas has not been given a normal assignment, but instead has been selected as the next Receiver of Memory, to be trained by the current one, who sits among the Elders, staring at Jonas, and who shares with the boy unusual pale eyes. The position of Receiver has high status and responsibility, and Jonas quickly finds himself growing distant from his classmates, including his close friends Asher and Fiona. The rules Jonas receives further separate him, as they allow him no time to play with his friends and require him to keep his training secret. They also allow him to lie and withhold his feelings from his family, things generally not allowed in the regimented Community.Once he begins it, Jonas's training makes clear his uniqueness, for the Receiver of Memory is just that—a person who bears the burden of the memories from all of history, and who is the only one allowed access to books beyond schoolbooks and the rulebook issued to every household. The current Receiver, who asks Jonas to call him the Giver, begins the process of transferring those memories to Jonas, for the ordinary person in the Community knows nothing of the past. These memories, and being the only Community member allowed access to books about the past, give the Receiver perspective to advise the Council of Elders. The first memory is of sliding down a snow-covered hill on a sled, pleasantness made shocking by the fact that Jonas has never seen a sled, or snow, or a hill—for the memories of even these things have been given up to assure security and conformity (called Sameness). Even color has been surrendered, and the Giver shows Jonas a rainbow. Less pleasantly, he gives Jonas memories of hunger and war, things alien to the boy. Hanging over Jonas's training is the fact that the Giver once before had an apprentice, named Rosemary, but the boy finds his parents and the Giver reluctant to discuss what happened to her.Jonas's father is concerned about an infant at the Nurturing Center who is failing to thrive and has received special permission to bring him home at night. The baby's name will be Gabriel if he grows strong enough to be assigned to a family. He has pale eyes, like Jonas and the Giver. Jonas grows attached to him, especially when Jonas finds that he can receive memories. If Gabriel does not increase in strength, he will be ""released from the Community""—in common speech, taken Elsewhere. This has happened to an off-course air pilot, to chronic rule breakers, to elderly people, and to the apprentice Rosemary. After Jonas speculates about life in Elsewhere, the Giver educates him by showing the boy hidden-camera video of Jonas's father doing his job: releasing the smaller of twoidentical twinnewborns through lethal injection before putting it in a trash chute, since identical community members are forbidden. There is no Elsewhere for those not wanted by the Community—those said to have been ""released"" have been killed.Since he now considers his father a murderer, Jonas initially refuses to return home, but the Giver convinces him that without the memories, the people of the Community cannot know that what they have been trained to do is wrong. Rosemary was unable to endure the darker memories of the past and instead killed herself with the poison. Jonas and the Giver devise a plan to return the community's memories so they may know where they have gone wrong. Both agree that Jonas will leave the community thereby returning the memories to them, while the Giver will stay to help them learn to live with their memories before joining his daughter, Rosemary, in death. They plan to fake Jonas's drowning to limit the search for him, but he instead must escape in a rush with Gabriel, upon learning of the child's imminent release. The two are near death from cold and starvation when they reach the border of what Jonas believes must be Elsewhere. Using his ability to ""see beyond"", a gift that he does not quite understand, he finds a sled waiting for him at the top of a snowy hill. He and Gabriel ride the sled down towards a house filled with colored lights and warmth and love and a Christmas tree, and for the first time he hears something he believes must be music. The ending is ambiguous, with Jonas depicted as experiencing symptoms ofhypothermia. This leaves his and Gabriel's future unresolved. However, their fate is revealed inMessengerandSon, companion novels written years later.[10]BackgroundLowry has stated that her books all explore ""the importance of human connection… the vital need for humans to be aware of their interdependence, not only with each other, but with the world and its environment.""[11]Like Lowry's other books,The Givershows changes in the characters' lives, reflecting this fascination in the multifaceted dimensions of growing up.[12]The Giverwas initially inspired by Lowry's interaction with her father, who, in his senility, kept forgetting about the long-ago death of her sister;[13]she imagined ""a novel in which people are deprived of the memories of suffering, grief, and pain.""[14]She based the novel's setting in part on the closely guarded army bases in which she had grown up, her father having been an army dentist.[13]She has stated, of the characters inThe Giver, they have lived in a sterile world for so long that they are in danger of losing the real emotions that make them human.[15]Analysis of themesMemoryBradford et al. argue thatThe Giverrepresents a community where the lack of cultural memory leads to an inability to avoid societal mistakes, preventing the community from becoming a true Utopia, thus conferring transformational potential on human memory.[16]Hanson interprets the restriction of memory as totalitarian and argues that Lowry demonstrates the emancipatory potential of memory inThe Giver.[17]Triplett and Han suggest that Jonas's role as receiver of memory, allowing him a deeper understanding of his societal and cultural context, demonstrates the validity of suspicious methods of reading that attempt to obtain deeper rather than surface meanings.[18]ReligionBradford et al. suggestThe Giver's depiction of Christmas at the novel's end implies that an ideal community is in part represented by a family Christmas, therefore situating the novel as conservative.[19]Graeme Wend-Walker, an academic, analyzed the then-trilogy in 2013 through a post-secular lens and suggested that removing religion entirely from human society and lives could diminish humanity's capacity for accepting differences rather than providing for human liberation as some may assume.[20]Countering Bradford's claim, which would suggest that the novel is conservative rather than transformative due to its religious imagery and undertones, Wend-Walker's post-secular reading suggests that the novel explores the ambiguity between the secular and religious binary which provides it progressive potential by allowing for the transformative potential of the spiritual.[21]ColorSusan G. Lea has emphasized that sameness is crucial to the world ofThe Giver, and furthermore that their monochromatic vision creates a color blindness within the community that cannot be aware of the effects of the absence of color.[22]She likens the lack of difference and literal color blindness ofThe Giver's community with color blind attitudes that act as if racial difference does not exist, and suggests that the book shows the way that colorblindness erases people of color and their experiences through their lack of visibility.[23]Kyoungmin and Lee examine Jonas's growing ability to see color rather than the lack of color in his community and argue that his selfhood grows as his memory and perception of color grow.[24]They suggest that Jonas's full perception of color at the end is what allows him to choose to travel elsewhere as an autonomous agent in comparison to others in his community.[25]Eugenics and gene editingElizabeth Bridges reads an implication of gene editing in the development of the homogenous community, based on euphemistic language throughout the novel.[26]She suggests that the release of those who do not fit societal conventions represents the ways that eugenics were employed by the society ofThe Giver.[26]Robert Gadowski suggests that government control of bodies inhibits the society's freedoms.[27]He argues that through bio-technical planning, people's bodies become vehicles of state control rather than the locus of their autonomy.[28]Literary significance and receptionIn the United States,The Giverhas become frequently assigned as reading in schools, as well as library-sponsored reading clubs and ""City Reads"" programs.[29][30]However, reviewers have commented that the story lacks originality and is not likely to stand up to the sort of probing literary criticism used in ""serious"" circles. Others argue that the book's appeal to a young-adult audience is critical for building a developing reader's appetite for reading.[31]Karen Ray, writing inThe New York Times, detects ""occasional logical lapses"", but adds that the book ""is sure to keep older children reading"".[32]Young adult fiction authorDebra Doylewas more critical, stating that ""Personal taste aside,The Giverfails the [science fiction] Plausibility Test,"" and that ""Things are the way they are [in the novel] because The Author is Making A Point; things work out the way they do because The Author's Point Requires It.""[33]Children's authorNatalie Babbitt, writing inThe Washington Postcalled the novel ""a warning in narrative form,"" saying: ""The story has been told before in a variety of forms—Ray Bradbury'sFahrenheit 451comes to mind—but not, to my knowledge, for children. It's well worth telling, especially by a writer of Lowry's great skill. If it is exceedingly fragile—if, in other words, some situations do not survive that well-knownsuspension of disbelief—well, so be it.The Giverhas things to say that cannot be said too often, and I hope there will be many, many young people who will be willing to listen.[34]A review inThe Horn Book Magazinestated, ""In a departure from her well-known and favorably regarded realistic works, Lois Lowry has written a fascinating, thoughtful science-fiction novel... The story is skillfully written; the air of disquiet is delicately insinuated. And the theme of balancing the virtues of freedom and security is beautifully presented.""[35]Censorship in the United StatesThe Giverhas been a frequent subject of bans, or attempted bans, in school libraries, due to its dark themes and violence.[36]In a 2020 question-and-answer session, Lowry stated that the calls for banning have usually come from parents and others who have not read the book, but only seen descriptions or out-of-context quotes; and that those who have called for its banning have usually changed their mind after reading it.[13]Lowry has stated that she is against any censorship, and that no literature should be considered off-limits.[13]Some[who?]have noted the irony of wanting to censor a novel that warns about societal control of children.[37][38]Awards, nominations, and recognitionLowry won many awards for her work onThe Giver, including the following:The 1994Newbery Medal– The John Newbery award (Medal) is given by theAssociation for Library Service to Children. The award is given for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.[39]The 1994Regina Medal[40]The 1996William Allen White Award[41]American Library Associationlistings for ""Best Book forYoung Adults"", ""ALA Notable Children's Book"", and ""100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990–2000.""A Boston Globe-Horn Book Honor BookBooklistEditors' ChoiceASchool Library JournalBest Book of the YearA 2004 study found thatThe Giverwas a common read-aloud book for sixth-graders in schools inSan Diego County, California.[42]Based on a 2007 online poll, theNational Education Associationlisted it as one of ""Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children"".[43]In 2012 it was ranked number four among all-time children's novels in a survey published bySchool Library Journal.[44]AdaptationsOregon Children's Theatre(Portland, Oregon) premiered a stage adaptation ofThe GiverbyEric Coblein March 2006. Subsequent productions of Coble's one-hour script have been presented in several American theatres.Another stage adaptation, written by Diana Basmajian, was produced byPrime Stage Theatrein 2006.[45]ActorRon Rifkinreads the text for theaudiobookedition.TheLyric Opera of Kansas Cityand theMinnesota Operaco-commissioned and premiered an opera by Susan Kander based on the novel.[46]It was presented in Kansas City in January and Minneapolis on April 27–29, 2012, and was webcast on May 18, 2012.[47]In 2017, a stage musical adaptation was in the development stages, with a book byMartin Zimmermanand music and lyrics by Jonah Platt and Andrew Resnick.[48]HMH Books for Young Readerspublished a comic book adaptation in spring 2019 illustrated and adapted by Eisner and Harvey Award winnerP. Craig Russell.[49]Film adaptationMain article:The Giver(film)In the fall of 1994, actorBill Cosbyand his ASIS Productions film company established an agreement with Lancit Media Productions to adaptThe Giverto film. In the years following, members of the partnership changed and the production team grew in size, but little motion was seen toward making the film. At one point, screenwriter Ed Neumeier was signed to create the screenplay. Later, Neumeier was replaced byTodd Alcott[50]andWalden Mediabecame the central production company.[51][52]Jeff Bridges has said he had wanted to make the film for nearly 20 years, and originally wanted to direct it with his fatherLloyd Bridgesin the title role. The elder Bridges' 1998 death cancelled that plan and the film languished indevelopment hellfor another 15 years. Warner Bros. bought the rights in 2007 and thefilm adaptationwas finally given thegreen lightin December 2012.Jeff Bridgesplays the title character[53]withBrenton Thwaitesin the role of Jonas.Meryl Streep,Katie Holmes,Odeya Rush,Cameron Monaghan,Alexander SkarsgårdandTaylor Swiftround out the rest of the main cast.[54][55]It was released in North America on August 15, 2014.References^Pavlos, Suzanne.""The Giver - Book Summary"".CliffsNotes.

The film features anensemble castthat includesMarlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan,Richard Castellano,Robert Duvall,Sterling Hayden,John Marley,Richard ConteandDiane Keaton. It is the first installment inThe Godfathertrilogy, which chronicles theCorleone familyunder patriarchVito Corleone(Brando) and the transformation of his youngest son,Michael Corleone(Pacino), from reluctant family outsider to ruthlessmafia boss.Paramount Picturesobtained the rights to the novel for $80,000, before it gained popularity.[5][6]Studio executives had trouble finding a director; the first few candidates turned down the position before Coppola signed on to direct the film but disagreement followed over casting several characters, in particular Vito (Brando) and Michael (Pacino). Filming took place primarily in locations aroundNew York CityandSicily, and it was completed ahead of schedule. The score was composed principally byNino Rota, with additional pieces byCarmine Coppola.The Godfatherpremiered at theLoew's State Theatreon March 14, 1972, and was widely released in the United States on March 24, 1972. It was thehighest-grossing film of 1972, and was for a time thehighest-grossing film ever made, earning between $250 and $291 million at the box office. The film was acclaimed by critics and audiences, who praised its performances—particularly those of Brando and Pacino—direction, screenplay, story, cinematography, editing, score and portrayal of themafia.The Godfatherlaunched the successful careers of Coppola, Pacino and other relative newcomers in the cast and crew. At the45th Academy Awards, the film wonBest Picture,Best Actor(Brando) andBest Adapted Screenplay(for Puzo and Coppola). In addition, the seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, Caan and Duvall, all forBest Supporting Actor, and Coppola forBest Director.The Godfatheris regarded as one of thegreatest and most influential films ever made, as well as a landmark of the gangster genre.[7]It was selected for preservation in the U.S.National Film Registryof theLibrary of Congressin 1990, being deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is ranked thesecond-greatest film in American cinema(behindCitizen Kane) by theAmerican Film Institute. It was followed by sequelsThe Godfather Part II(1974) andThe Godfather Part III(1990).Plot[edit]In 1945, thedonofNew York City'sCorleone family,Vito Corleone, listens to requests during his daughterConnie's wedding toCarlo Rizzi. Vito's youngest sonMichael, aMarineandWorld War IIhero who has so far stayed out of the family business, introduces his girlfriendKay Adamsto his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a popular singer and Vito'sgodson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role. Vito sends hisconsigliere,Tom Hagen, to persuade studio president Jack Woltz to offer Johnny the part. Woltz refuses Hagen's request at first, but soon complies after finding the severed head of his prized stud horse in his bed.AsChristmasapproaches, drug baronVirgil ""The Turk"" Sollozzoasks Vito to invest in his narcotics business to provide police protection. Vito declines, citing that involvement in narcotics would alienate his political connections. Suspicious of Sollozzo's partnership with the Tattaglia crime family, Vito sends his enforcerLuca Brasito the Tattaglias on an espionage mission. Brasi isgarrotedto death during the initial meeting. Later, enforcers gun down Vito and coerce Hagen into a meeting. With Vito's first-bornSonnynow in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept the narcotics deal. Vito survives the shooting and is visited in the hospital by Michael, who finds him unprotected afterNYPDpolice officers on Sollozzo's payroll clear out Vito's guards. Michael stops the attempt on his father's life but is beaten by corrupt police captain Mark McCluskey. After the attemptedhitat the hospital, Sonny retaliates with a hit on Bruno Tattaglia. Sollozzo and McCluskey request to meet with Michael and settle the dispute. The Corleones agree to the meeting and devise a plan to plant a handgun in the bathroom of the Bronx restaurant where the meeting will be held. Michael speaks with Sollozzo for several minutes then excuses himself, retrieves the gun, and shoots both men dead.Despite a clampdown by the authorities for the killing of a police captain, theFive Familieserupt in open warfare. Michael takes refuge inSicily, and Vito's second sonFredois sheltered by Jewish mobsterMoe GreeneinLas Vegas. In Sicily, Michael meets and marries a local woman,Apollonia. Sonny publicly attacks and threatens Carlo for physically abusing Connie. When he abuses her again, Sonny speeds to their home but is ambushed and murdered by gangsters at a highway toll booth. Apollonia is killed shortly thereafter by acar bombintended for Michael.Devastated by Sonny's death and tired of war, Vito sets up a meeting with the Five Families. He assures them that he will withdraw his opposition to their narcotics business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay. They have two children in the early 1950s. With his father nearing the end of his life and Fredo not suited to lead, Michael assumes the position of head of the Corleone family. Vito tells Michael that he now knows that their true adversary had been DonBarziniall along. He warns him that Barzini would try to kill him at a meeting organized by a traitorous Corleonecapo. With Vito's support, Michael relegates Hagen to managing operations in Las Vegas as he is not a ""wartime consigliere"". Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Moe Greene's stake in the family's casinos and reprimands Fredo for defending Greene, whom Barzini had turned against the family.In 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with Michael's sonAnthony. At Vito's funeral,Tessioasks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. Michael deduces the plot and Tessio is led off to be murdered. While Michael stands at the baptismal font as the child's godfather, Corleone hitmen murder the dons of the four other families as well as Greene for not selling his hotel. Michael extracts Carlo's confession that he had conspired with Barzini on Sonny's assassination. He assures Carlo that he is being exiled, not murdered. However, Clemenza strangles Carlo in a car shortly afterwards. Connie confronts Michael about his involvement in Carlo's death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if he ordered Carlo's death, which Michael denies, leaving Kay relieved. As she leaves,caposenter the office and pay reverence to Michael as ""Don Corleone"".Cast[edit]See also:List ofThe GodfathercharactersBrando (right) and Pacino as Don Vito and Michael Corleone, respectivelyMarlon BrandoasVito Corleone:crime bossand patriarch of theCorleone familyAl PacinoasMichael Corleone: Vito's youngest sonJames CaanasSonny Corleone: Vito's eldest sonRichard CastellanoasPeter Clemenza: acaporegimein the Corleone crime family, Sonny's godfatherRobert DuvallasTom Hagen: Corleoneconsigliere, lawyer, and unofficial adopted member of the Corleone familySterling HaydenasCaptain McCluskey: a corrupt police captain on Sollozzo's payrollJohn Marleyas Jack Woltz: Hollywood film producer who is intimidated by the CorleonesRichard ConteasEmilio Barzini: a crime boss of a rival familyAl LettieriasVirgil Sollozzo: an adversary who attempts to pressure Vito to get into the drug business, backed by the Tattaglia familyDiane KeatonasKay Adams-Corleone: Michael's girlfriend and, later, second wifeAbe VigodaasSalvatore Tessio: acaporegimein the Corleone crime familyTalia ShireasConnie Corleone: Vito's only daughterGianni RussoasCarlo Rizzi: Connie's abusive husbandJohn CazaleasFredo Corleone: Vito's middle sonRudy Bondas Cuneo: a crime boss of a rival familyAl MartinoasJohnny Fontane: a singer and Vito's godsonMorgana KingasCarmela Corleone: Vito's wifeLenny MontanaasLuca Brasi: Vito's enforcerJohnny Martinoas Paulie Gatto: a soldier in the Corleone crime familySalvatore Corsitto asAmerigo Bonasera: the undertaker who asks for a favor at Connie's weddingRichard BrightasAl Neri: the soldier in the Corleone crime family who becomes Michael's enforcerAlex RoccoasMoe Greene: aJewish mobsterandLas Vegascasino proprietorTony Giorgioas Bruno Tattaglia: a rival mobster and Philip Tattaglia's brother.Vito Scottias Nazorine: abakerand associate of Don Corleone.Tere Livrano asTheresa Hagen: Tom's wifeVictor Rendinaas Philip Tattaglia: head of the Tattaglia crime family and prostitution crime bossJeannie LineroasLucy Mancini: Connie's friend and Sonny's mistressJulie GreggasSandra Corleone: Sonny's wifeArdell Sheridan as Mrs. Clemenza, Peter Clemenza's wifeSimonetta StefanelliasApollonia Vitelli-Corleone: Michael's Sicilian wife.[3][8]Angelo Infantias Fabrizio: Michael's Sicilian bodyguard, who later betrays and tries to kill him.[3][8]Franco Cittias Calò: Michael's other Sicilian bodyguard.[3][8]Corrado Gaipaas Don Tommasino: aPalermocrime boss and Michael's guardian in Sicily.[3][8]Saro Urzìas Signor Vitelli: Apollonia's father.[3][8]Uncredited members of the cast includeTom RosquiasRocco Lampone; one of Michael's enforcers,Joe Spinell[9]as Willi Cicci; one of Clemenza's enforcers, Gabriele Torrei as Enzo the baker, and Anthony Gounaris as Anthony Corleone. Francis Ford Coppola's daughterSofia, who was still an infant at the time, appears uncredited as Michael Rizzi in the baptism sequence.[10]Production[edit]Development[edit]The film is based onMario Puzo'sThe Godfather, which remained onThe New York TimesBest Seller listfor 67 weeks and sold over nine million copies in two years.[11][12][13]Published in 1969, it became the best selling published work in history for several years.[14]Burt LancasterandDanny Thomasboth expressed interest adapting the book.[15]Paramount Picturesoriginally found out about Puzo's novel in 1967 when a literary scout for the company contacted then Paramount Vice President of ProductionPeter Bartabout Puzo's unfinished sixty-page manuscript titledMafia.[12]Bart believed the work was ""much beyond a Mafia story"" and offered Puzo a $12,500 option for the work, with an option for $80,000 if the finished work were to be made into a film.[12][16]Despite Puzo's agent telling him to turn down the offer, Puzo was desperate for money and accepted the deal.[12][16]Paramount'sRobert Evansrelates that, when they met in early 1968, he offered Puzo the deal after the author confided in him that he urgently needed $10,000 to pay off gambling debts.[17]In March 1967, Paramount announced that it backed Puzo's upcoming work in the hopes of making a film.[12]In 1969, Paramount confirmed their intentions to make a film out of the novel for the price of $80,000,[N 3][16][18][19][20]with aims to have the film released on Christmas Day in 1971.[21]On March 23, 1970,Albert S. Ruddywas officially announced as the film's producer, in part because studio executives were impressed with his interview and because he was known for bringing his films in under budget.[22][23][24]Direction[edit]Francis Ford Coppola(pictured in 1973) was selected as director. Paramount wanted the picture to be directed by anItalian Americanto make the film ""ethnic to the core"".Evans wanted the picture to be directed by anItalian Americanto make the film ""ethnic to the core"".[25][26]Paramount's latest gangster film,The Brotherhood, had done very poorly at the box office;[13][27]Evans believed that the reason for its failure was its almost complete lack of cast members or creative personnel of Italian descent (the directorMartin Rittand starKirk Douglaswere not Italian).[17]Sergio Leonewas Paramount's first choice to direct the film.[28][29]Leone turned down the option, in order to work on his own gangster filmOnce Upon a Time in America.[28][29]Peter Bogdanovichwas then approached but he also declined the offer because he was not interested in the mafia.[30][31][32]In addition,Peter Yates,Richard Brooks,Arthur Penn,Franklin J. Schaffner,Costa-Gavras, andOtto Premingerwere all offered the position and declined.[33][34][35]Evans' chief assistant Peter Bart suggestedFrancis Ford Coppola, as a director of Italian ancestry who would work for a low sum and budget after the poor performance of his latest filmThe Rain People.[36][25]Coppola initially turned down the job because he found Puzo's novel sleazy and sensationalist, describing it as ""pretty cheap stuff"".[17][37]At the time Coppola's studio,American Zoetrope,[38]owed over $400,000 toWarner Bros.for budget overruns with the filmTHX 1138and when coupled with his poor financial standing, along with advice from friends and family, Coppola reversed his initial decision and took the job.[34][39][40][41]Coppola was officially announced as director of the film on September 28, 1970.[42]Coppola agreed to receive $125,000 and six percent of the gross rentals.[43][44]Coppola later found a deeper theme for the material and decided that the film should not be about organized crime but a family chronicle, a metaphor for capitalism in America.[25]Coppola and Paramount[edit]BeforeThe Godfatherwas in production, Paramount had been going through an unsuccessful period.[13]In addition to the failure ofThe Brotherhood, other recent films that were produced or co-produced by Paramount had greatly exceeded their budgets:Darling Lili,[23]Paint Your Wagon, andWaterloo.[13][27]The budget for the film was originally $2.5 million but as the book grew in popularity Coppola argued for and ultimately received a larger budget.[N 1][33][45][47]Paramount executives wanted the movie to be set in contemporaryKansas Cityand shot in the studio backlot in order to cut down on costs.[33][23][45]Coppola objected and wanted to set the movie in the same time period as the novel, the 1940s and 1950s;[23][33][40][42]Coppola's reasons included Michael Corleone's spell in the wartime Marine Corps, the emergence of corporate America, and America in the years after World War II.[42]The novel was becoming increasingly successful and so Coppola's wishes were eventually granted.[23][45]The studio heads subsequently let Coppola film on location in New York City and Sicily.[53]Gulf+Western executiveCharles Bluhdornwas frustrated with Coppola over the number of screen tests he had performed without finding a person to play the various roles.[48]Production quickly fell behind because of Coppola's indecisiveness and conflicts with Paramount, which led to costs being around $40,000 per day.[48]With costs rising, Paramount had the Vice President, Jack Ballard, keep a close eye on production expenses.[54]While filming, Coppola stated that he felt he could be fired at any point as he knew Paramount executives were not happy with many of the decisions he had made.[33]Coppola was aware that Evans had askedElia Kazanto take over directing the film because he feared that Coppola was too inexperienced to cope with the increased size of the production.[55]Coppola was also convinced that the film editor,Aram Avakian, and the assistant director, Steve Kestner, were conspiring to get him fired. Avakian complained to Evans that he could not edit the scenes correctly because Coppola was not shooting enough footage. Evans was satisfied with the footage being sent to the West Coast—in which there was also the scene of Michael's double murder in the Bronx restaurant[56]—and authorized Coppola to fire them both. Coppola later explained, ""Like the godfather, I fired people as a preemptory strike. The people who were angling the most to have me fired, I had fired.""[57]Brando threatened to quit if Coppola was fired.[33][54]Paramount wantedThe Godfatherto appeal to a wide audience and threatened Coppola with a ""violence coach"" to make the film more exciting. Coppola did add a few more violent scenes to keep the studio happy: the scene in which Connie smashescrockeryafter finding out Carlo has been cheating was added for this reason.[40]Writing[edit]On April 14, 1970, it was revealed that Puzo was hired by Paramount for $100,000, along with a percentage of the film's profits, to work on the screenplay for the film.[24][58][59]Working from the book, Coppola wanted to have the themes of culture, character, power, and family at the forefront of the film, whereas Puzo wanted to retain aspects from his novel[60]and his initial draft of 150 pages was finished on August 10, 1970.[58][59]After Coppola was hired as director, both Puzo and Coppola worked on the screenplay, but separately.[61]Puzo worked on his draft in Los Angeles, while Coppola wrote his version inSan Francisco.[61]Coppola created a book where he tore pages out of Puzo's book and pasted them into his book.[62][61]There, he made notes about each of the book's fifty scenes, which related to major themes prevalent in the scene, whether the scene should be included in the film, along with ideas and concepts that could be used when filming to make the film true to Italian culture.[61][54]The two remained in contact while they wrote their respective screenplays and made decisions on what to include and what to remove for the final version.[61]A second draft was completed on March 1, 1971, and was 173 pages long.[58][63]The final screenplay was finished on March 29, 1971,[59]and wound up being 163 pages long,[58][61]40 pages over what Paramount had asked for.[64]When filming, Coppola referred to the notebook he had created over the final draft of the screenplay.[61][54]ScreenwriterRobert Townedid uncredited work on the script, particularly on the Pacino-Brando garden scene.[65]Despite finishing the third draft, some scenes in the film were still not written yet and were written during production.[66]TheItalian-American Civil Rights League, led by mobsterJoseph Colombo, maintained that the film emphasized stereotypes about Italian-Americans, and wanted all uses of the words ""mafia"" and ""Cosa Nostra"" to be removed from the script.[67][21][68][69][70]The league also requested that all the money earned from the premiere be donated to the league's fund to build a new hospital.[69][70]Coppola claimed that Puzo's screenplay only contained two instances of the word ""mafia"" being used, while ""Cosa Nostra"" was not used at all.[69][70]They were removed and replaced with other terms, without compromising the story.[69][70]The league eventually gave its support for the script.[69][70]Earlier, the windows of producerAlbert S. Ruddy's car had been shot out with a note left on the dashboard which essentially said, ""shut down the movie—or else.""[25]However, it was revealed in August 1971 that Ruddy personally met withColombo familyhead Joseph Colombo, Columbo's son Anthony and about 1,500 delegates of Columbo's Italian-American Civil Rights League when he was developing the film, with the first meeting being held on February 25, 1971.[71]Ruddy would also hold numerous meetings with Anthony Colombo.[71]These meetings led to Ruddy agreeing to base the film on individuals and assuring that it would not defame or stereotype Italians.[71]It was even reported that Anthony Colombo eventually made Ruddy an honorary captain of the League.[71]Casting[edit]Marlon Brandowas chosen to portrayVito Corleone.Al Pacinowas chosen to portrayMichael Corleone.James CaanportrayedSonny Corleone.Puzo was first to show interest in havingMarlon Brandoportray Don Vito Corleone by sending a letter to Brando in which he stated Brando was the ""only actor who can play the Godfather"".[72]Despite Puzo's wishes, the executives at Paramount were against having Brando,[38]partly because of the poor performance of his recent films and also his short temper.[45][73]Brando was hesitant about getting back into acting, but his secretary Alice Marchak persuaded him to audition.[74]Coppola favored Brando orLaurence Olivierfor the role,[75][76]but Olivier's agent refused the role claiming Olivier was sick;[77]however, Olivier went on to star inSleuthlater that year.[76]Evans pushed for eitherCarlo PontiorErnest Borgnineto receive the part.[75][78]Bluhdorn proposedCharles Bronsonfor the role.[78]Others considered wereGeorge C. Scott,Richard Conte(who was ultimately cast as Don Barzini),Raf Vallone,Anthony QuinnandOrson Welles.[75][79][80]Welles met with Puzo and tried to convince him that he was right for the role.[81]After months of debate between Coppola and Paramount over Brando, the two finalists for the role were Borgnine and Brando;[82]Paramount presidentStanley Jafferequired Brando to perform a screen test.[83][84]Coppola did not want to offend Brando and stated that he needed to test equipment in order to set up the screen test at Brando'sCaliforniaresidence.[84][85]For make-up, Brando stuck cotton balls in his cheeks,[82]put shoe polish in his hair to darken it, and rolled his collar.[86]Coppola placed Brando's audition tape in the middle of the videos of the audition tapes as the Paramount executives watched them.[87]The executives were impressed with Brando's efforts and allowed Coppola to cast Brando for the role if Brando accepted a lower salary and put up a bond to ensure he would not cause any delays in production.[82][87][88]Brando earned $1.6 million from a net participation deal.[89]From the start of production, Coppola wantedRobert Duvallto play the part of Tom Hagen.[21][90][91]After screen testing several other actors, Coppola eventually got his wish and Duvall was awarded the part.[90][91]Al Martino, a then famed singer in nightclubs, was notified of the character Johnny Fontane by a friend who read the novel and felt Martino represented the character of Johnny Fontane. Martino then contacted producerAlbert S. Ruddy, who gave him the part. However, Martino was stripped of the part after Coppola became director and then awarded the role to singerVic Damone. According to Martino, after being stripped of the role, he went toRussell Bufalino, his godfather and a crime boss, who then arranged for news articles to be published that claimed Coppola was unaware of Ruddy giving Martino the part.[25]Damone eventually dropped the role because he did not want to provoke the mob, in addition to the salary being too low.[25][92]Ultimately, althoughFrank Sinatrathreatened to bar him fromLas Vegasif he took the role,[93]the part of Johnny Fontane was given to Martino.[25][92]Coppola castDiane Keatonfor the role of Kay Adams owing to her reputation for beingeccentric.[94]John Cazalewas given the part of Fredo Corleone after Coppola saw him perform in an Off Broadway production.[94]Gianni Russowas given the role of Carlo Rizzi after he was asked to perform a screen test in which he acted out the fight between Rizzi and Connie.[95]Nearing the start of filming on March 29,Michael Corleonehad yet to be cast.[96]Paramount executives wanted a popular actor, eitherWarren BeattyorRobert Redford.[97][82][98]Producer Robert Evans wantedRyan O'Nealto receive the role, owing in part to his recent success inLove Story.[98][99]Pacino was Coppola's favorite for the role[38]as he could picture him roaming the Sicilian countryside, and wanted an unknown actor who looked like an Italian-American.[40][98][99]However, Paramount executives found Pacino to be too short to play Michael.[21][25]Many actors also auditioned, includingDustin Hoffman,Martin Sheen,Dean Stockwell, andJames Caan.[94][35][100]Keaton read with both Caan and Sheen.[101]Burt Reynoldswas offered the role of Michael, but Brando threatened to quit if Reynolds was hired. Reynolds declined the role.[102]Jack Nicholsonwas also offered the role, but declined it as he felt that an Italian-American actor should play the role.[103][104]Caan was well received by the Paramount executives and was given the part of Michael initially, while the role ofSonny Corleonewas awarded toCarmine Caridi.[25]Coppola still pushed for Pacino to play Michael after the fact and Evans eventually conceded, allowing Pacino to have the role of Michael as long as Caan played Sonny.[105]Evans preferred Caan over Caridi because Caan was seven inches shorter than Caridi, which was much closer to Pacino's height.[25]Despite agreeing to play Michael Corleone, Pacino was contracted to star in MGM'sThe Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, but the two studios agreed on a settlement and Pacino was signed by Paramount three weeks before shooting began.[106]Robert De Nirooriginally was given the part of Paulie Gatto.[107][82]A spot inThe Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straightopened up afterAl Pacinoquit the project in favor ofThe Godfather, which led De Niro to audition for the role and leaveThe Godfatherafter receiving the part.[107][108]De Niro was also cast for the role of Sonny Corleone.[109][110][111]After De Niro quit,Johnny Martinowas given the role of Gatto.[25][112][113][114][115][116][117][118]Coppola gave several roles in the film to family members.[25]He gave his sister,Talia Shire, the role of Connie Corleone.[119][120]His daughterSofia, then an infant, appeared as Michael Francis Rizzi, Connie's and Carlo's newborn son.[25][121]Carmine Coppola, his father, appeared in the film as an extra playing a piano during a scene.[122]Coppola's wife, mother, and two sons all appeared as extras in the picture.[25]Several smaller roles, likeLuca Brasi, were cast after the filming had started.[123]Ruddy's casting choices would earn him more approval from theItalian-American Civil Rights League, with Anthony Colombo reported to have made Ruddy a league captain after the meeting where the film's bit players and extras were chosen.[71]Filming[edit]The Don Barzini assassination scene was filmed on the steps of theNew York Supreme Courtbuilding onFoley SquareinManhattan.[124]Before the filming began, the cast received a two-week period for rehearsal, which included a dinner where each actor and actress had to assume character for its duration.[125]Filming was scheduled to begin on March 29, 1971, with the scene between Michael Corleone and Kay Adams as they leaveBest & Co.in New York City after shopping for Christmas gifts.[126][127]The weather on March 23 predicted snow flurries, which caused Ruddy to move the filming date forward; snow did not materialize and a snow machine was used.[127]Principal filming in New York continued until July 2, 1971.[128][129]Coppola asked for a three-week break before heading overseas to film in Sicily.[128]Following the crew's departure for Sicily, Paramount announced that the release date would be moved to early 1972.[130]CinematographerGordon Willisinitially turned down the opportunity to filmThe Godfatherbecause the production seemed ""chaotic"" to him.[131][105]After Willis later accepted the offer, he and Coppola agreed to not use any modern filming devices, helicopters, or zoom lenses.[132]Willis and Coppola chose to use a ""tableau format"" of filming to make it seem like a painting.[132]He made use of shadows and low light levels throughout the film to show psychological developments.[132]Willis and Coppola agreed to interplay light and dark scenes throughout the film.[48]Willis underexposed the film in order to create a ""yellow tone"".[132]The scenes in Sicily were shot to display the countryside and ""display a more romantic land,"" giving these scenes a ""softer, more romantic"" feel than the New York scenes.[133]1941Packard Super Eightfeatured inThe GodfatherOne scene in the film involved an actual severed horse's head.[40][134]The filming location for this scene is contested, as some sources indicate it was filmed at theBeverly Estate, while others indicate it was filmed atSands Point Preserveon Long Island.[135][136][137]Coppola received some criticism for the scene, although the head was obtained from a dog-food company from a horse that was to be killed regardless of the film.[138][139][140]On June 22, the scene where Sonny is killed was shot on a runway atMitchel Fieldin Uniondale, where three tollbooths were built, along with guard rails, and billboards to set the scene.[141]Sonny's car was a 1941 Lincoln Continental with holes drilled in it to resemble bullet holes.[142][143]The scene took three days to film and cost over $100,000.[144][143]Coppola's request to film on location was observed; approximately 90 percent was shot in New York City and its surrounding suburbs,[145][146]using over 120 distinct locations.[147]Several scenes were filmed atFilmwaysinEast Harlem.[148]The remaining portions were filmed in California, or in Sicily. The scenes set inLas Vegaswere not shot on location because there were insufficient funds.[145][149]SavocaandForza d'Agròwere the Sicilian towns featured in the film.[150]The opening wedding scene was shot in aStaten Islandneighborhood using almost 750 locals as extras.[146][151]The house used as the Corleone household and the wedding location was at 110 Longfellow Avenue in theTodt Hillneighborhood of Staten Island.[152][151][67]The wall around the Corleone compound was made fromstyrofoam.[151]Scenes set in and around the Corleone olive oil business were filmed onMott Street.[147][153]After filming had ended on August 7,[154]post-production efforts were focused on trimming the film to a manageable length.[155]In addition, producers and director were still including and removing different scenes from the end product, along with trimming certain sequences.[156]In September, the first rough cut of the film was viewed.[155]Many of the scenes removed from the film were centered around Sonny, which did not advance the plot.[157]By November, Coppola and Ruddy finished the semi-final cut.[157]Debates over personnel involved with the final editing remained even 25 years after the release of the film.[158]The film was shown to Paramount staff and exhibitors in late December 1971 and January 1972.[159]Music[edit]Main article:The Godfather (soundtrack)Coppola hired Italian composerNino Rotato create the underscore for the film, including ""Love Theme fromThe Godfather"".[160][161]For the score, Rota was to relate to the situations and characters in the film.[160][161]Rota synthesized new music for the film and took some parts from his 1958Fortunellafilm score, in order to create an Italian feel and evoke the tragedy within the film.[162]Paramount executive Evans found the score to be too ""highbrow"" and did not want to use it; however, it was used after Coppola managed to get Evans to agree.[160][161]Coppola believed that Rota's musical piece gave the film even more of an Italian feel.[161]Coppola's father,Carmine, created some additional music for the film,[163]particularly the music played by the band during the opening wedding scene.[161][162]Incidental music includes ""C'è la luna mezzo mare"", Cherubino's aria, ""Non so più cosa son"", fromMozart'sLe Nozze di Figaroand ""Brindisi"", fromVerdi'sLa traviata.[162][164]There was a soundtrack released for the film in 1972 in vinyl form byParamount Records, on CD in 1991 byGeffen Records, and digitally by Geffen on August 18, 2005.[165]The album contains over 31 minutes of music that was used in the film, most of which was composed by Rota, along with a song from Coppola and one by Johnny Farrow andMarty Symes.[166][167][168]AllMusicgave the album five out of five, with editor Zach Curd saying it is a ""dark, looming, and elegant soundtrack"".[166]An editor for Filmtracks believed that Rota was successful in relating the music to the film's core aspects.[168]Bach'sPrelude and Fugue in D major, BWV 532andPassacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582are played during the baptism scene.[169]Release[edit]Theatrical[edit]The world premiere forThe Godfathertook place atLoews's State Theatrein New York City on Tuesday, March 14, 1972, almost three months after the planned release date of Christmas Day in 1971,[170][171][3]with profits from the premiere donated to The Boys Club of New York.[172]Before the film premiered, the film had already made $15 million from advance rentals from over 400 theaters.[45]The following day,[38]the film opened in five theaters in New York (Loew'sState I and II, Orpheum, Cine and Tower East).[173][25][3]Next was theImperial TheatreinToronto[170]on March 17[174]and thenLos Angelesat two theaters on March 22.[175]The Godfatherwas released on March 24, 1972, throughout the rest of theUnited States[173][3]reaching 316 theaters five days later.[176]Home media[edit]The television rights were sold for a record $10 million toNBCfor one showing over two nights.[177]The theatrical version ofThe Godfatherdebuted on American network television on NBC with only minor edits.[178]The first half of the film aired on Saturday, November 16, 1974, and the second half two days later.[179]The television airings attracted a large audience with an averageNielsen ratingof 38.2 and audience share of 59% making it the eighth most-watched film on television, with the broadcast of the second half getting the third-best rating for a film on TV behindAirportandLove Storywith a rating of 39.4 and 57% share.[179]The broadcast helped generate anticipation for the upcoming sequel.[178]The next year, Coppola createdThe Godfather Sagaexpressly for American television in a release that combinedThe GodfatherandThe Godfather Part IIwith unused footage from those two films in a chronological telling that toned down the violent, sexual, and profane material for itsNBCdebut on November 18, 1977.[180]In 1981, Paramount released theGodfather Epicboxed set, which also told the story of the first two films in chronological order, again with additional scenes, but not redacted for broadcast sensibilities.[180]The Godfather Trilogywas released in 1992, in which the films are fundamentally in chronological order.[181]The Godfather Family: A Look Insidewas a 73-minute documentary released in 1991.[182]Directed by Jeff Warner, the film featured some behind the scenes content from all three films, interviews with the actors, and screen tests.[182]The Godfather DVD Collectionwas released on October 9, 2001, in a package that contained all three films—each with a commentary track by Coppola—and a bonus disc containingThe Godfather Family: A Look Inside.[183]The DVD also held a Corleone family tree, a ""Godfather"" timeline, and footage of the Academy Award acceptance speeches.[183]The Godfather: The Coppola Restoration[edit]During the film's original theatrical release, the original negatives were worn down due to the reel being printed so much to meet demand.[184][185]In addition, the duplicate negative was lost in Paramount archives.[185]In 2006 Coppola contactedSteven Spielberg—whose studioDreamWorkshad recently been bought out by Paramount—about restoringThe Godfather.[184][185]Robert A. Harriswas hired to oversee the restoration ofThe Godfatherand its two sequels, with the film's cinematographer Willis participating in the restoration.[186][187]Work began in November 2006 by repairing the negatives so they could go through a digital scanner to produce high-resolution 4K files. If a negative were damaged and discolored, work was done digitally to restore it to its original look.[184][185]After a year and a half of working on the restoration, the project was complete.[185]Paramount called the finished productThe Godfather: The Coppola Restorationand released it to the public on September 23, 2008, on both DVD andBlu-ray Disc.[186][187]Dave Kehr ofThe New York Timesbelieved the restoration brought back the ""golden glow of their original theatrical screenings"".[186]As a whole, the restoration of the film was well received by critics and Coppola.[184][185][186][187][188]The Godfather: The Coppola Restorationcontains several new special features that play in high definition, (including additional scenes, behind the scenes footage, etc.).[188]Paramount Pictures restored and remasteredThe Godfather,The Godfather Part II, andThe Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone(a re-edited cut of the third film) for a limited theatrical run and home media release on Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the premiere ofThe Godfather. The disc editions were released on March 22, 2022.[189]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]The Godfatherwas ablockbuster, breaking many box office records to become thehighest grossing film of 1972.[190]The film's opening day gross from five theaters was $57,829 with ticket prices increased from $3 to $3.50.[170]Prices in New York increased further at the weekend to $4, and the number of showings increased from four times a day to seven times a day.[170]The film grossed $61,615 in Toronto for the weekend[170]and $240,780 in New York,[191]for an opening weekend gross of $302,395. The film grossed $454,000 for the week in New York[170]and $115,000 in Toronto[174]for a first week gross of $568,800, which made it number one at the U.S. box office for the week.[192]In its first five days of national release, it grossed $6.8 million, taking its gross up to $7,397,164.[193]A week later its gross had reached $17,291,705[194]with the one week gross of around $10 million being an industry record.[195]It grossed another $8.7 million by April 9 to take its gross to $26,000,815.[196]After 18 weeks atnumber one in the United States, the film had grossed $101 million, the fastest film to reach that milestone.[197][198]Some news articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America,[175]but such accounts are erroneous; this record belongs toThe Sound of Music, released in 1965.[199]It remained at number one in the US for another five weeks to bring its total to 23 consecutive weeks at number one before being unseated byButterflies Are Freefor one week before becoming number one for another three weeks.[200][201]The film eventually earned $81.5 million intheatrical rentalsin the US and Canada during its initial release,[190][202]increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973,[203]and including a limited re-release in 1997,[204]it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million, with a production cost of $6.5 million.[173]It displacedGone with the Windto claim the record as the top rentals earner,[190]a position it would retain until the release ofJawsin 1975.[175][205]The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become thehighest net earner.[206]Profits were so high forThe Godfatherthat earnings forGulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount, jumped from 77 cents per share to $3.30 a share for the year, according to aLos Angeles Timesarticle, dated December 13, 1972.[175]Re-released eight more times since 1997, it has grossed between $250 million and $291 million in worldwide box office receipts,[N 2]and adjusted for ticket priceinflationin North America, ranks among the top 25highest-grossing films.[207]Critical response[edit]The Godfatherhas received overwhelming critical acclaim and is seen as one of thegreatest and most influential films of all time, particularly of thegangstergenre.[208]Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 9.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes,The Godfathergets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema.""[209]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, has assigned the film a score of 100 out of 100 based on 16 critic reviews, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[210]The Village Voice'sAndrew SarrisbelievedMarlon Brandoportrayed Vito Corleone well and that his character dominated each scene it appeared in, but felt Puzo and Coppola had the character of Michael Corleone too focused on revenge.[211]In addition, Sarris stated thatRichard Castellano,Robert Duvall, andJames Caanwere good in their respective roles.[211]Pauline KaelofThe New Yorkerwrote that ""If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out of a merger of commerce and art,The Godfatheris it...[Coppola] has stayed very close to the book's greased-lightning sensationalism and yet has made a movie with the spaciousness and strength that popular novels such asDickens' used to have."" She concluded that ""The Godfatheris popular melodrama, but it expresses a new tragic realism.""[212]Roger Ebertof theChicago Sun Timespraised the casting by Coppola and Ruddy: ""As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide inSterling Haydenand let the character go about his business."" He wrote that ""Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so ""The Godfather"" becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they'd tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn't have worked. But it's uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.""[213]Ebert namedThe Godfatherthe best film of 1972.[214]TheChicago Tribune'sGene Siskelgave the film four out of four, commenting that it was ""very good"".[215]Desson HoweofThe Washington Postcalled the film a ""jewel"" and wrote that Coppola deserves most of the credit for the film.[216]Writing forThe New York Times,Vincent Canbyfelt that Coppola had created one of the ""most brutal and moving chronicles of American life"" and went on to say that it ""transcends its immediate milieu and genre"".[217][218]DirectorStanley Kubrickthought the film had the best cast ever and could be the best movie ever made.[219]DirectorSteven Spielberglisted it among his favorite films.[220]Stanley KauffmannofThe New Republicwrote negatively of the film in a contemporary review, claiming that Pacino ""rattles around in a part too demanding for him"", while also criticizing Brando's make-up and Rota's score.[221]Previous mafia films had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider.[222]In contrast,The Godfatherpresents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society.[222]Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering.[223]George De Stefano argues that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping (such as when Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane to ""act like a man"") and is an important part of the film's appeal.[224]Remarking on the fortieth anniversary of the film's release, film criticJohn PodhoretzpraisedThe Godfatheras ""arguablythegreat American work of popular art"" and ""the summa of all great moviemaking before it"".[225]Two years before, Roger Ebert had written in his journal that it ""comes closest to being a film everyone agrees... is unquestionably great"".[226]Ebert added it to his canon of great movies, writing that ""a strange thing happed as I watched the restored version: Familiar as I am with Robert Duvall, when he first appeared on the screen I found myself thinking, 'There's Tom Hagen.' Coppola went to Italy to findNino Rota, composer of manyFellinifilms, to score the picture. Hearing the sadness and nostalgia of the movie's main theme, I realized what the music was telling us: Things would have turned out better if only they had listened to the Godfather.""[227]Accolades[edit]The Godfatherwas nominated for seven awards at the30th Golden Globe Awards:Best Picture – Drama,James CaanforBest Supporting Actor,Al PacinoandMarlon BrandoforBest Actor – Drama,Best Score,Best Director, andBest Screenplay.[228]When the winners were announced on January 28, 1973, the film had won the categories for: Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Actor – Drama (Brando), Best Original Score, and Best Picture – Drama.[229][230]Rota's score was also nominated forGrammy Award for Best Original Score for a Motion Picture or TV Specialat the15th Grammy Awards.[231][232]Rota was announced the winner of the category on March 3 at the Grammys' ceremony inNashville, Tennessee.[231][232]When the nominations for the45th Academy Awardswere revealed on February 12, 1973,The Godfatherwas nominated for eleven awards.[233][234]The nominations were for:Best Picture,Best Costume Design, Marlon Brando forBest Actor,Mario PuzoandFrancis Ford CoppolaforBest Adapted Screenplay, Pacino, Caan, andRobert DuvallforBest Supporting Actor,Best Film Editing,Nino RotaforBest Original Score, Coppola forBest Director, andBest Sound.[233][234][235]Upon further review of Rota'slove theme fromThe Godfather, the academy found that Rota had used a similar score inEduardo De Filippo's 1958 comedyFortunella.[236][237][238]This led to re-balloting, where members of the music branch chose from six films:The Godfatherand the five films that had been on the shortlist for best original dramatic score but did not get nominated.John Addison's score forSleuthwon this new vote, and thus replaced Rota's score on the official list of nominees.[239]Going into the awards ceremony,The Godfatherwas seen as the favorite to take home the most awards.[229]From the nominations thatThe Godfatherhad remaining, it only won three of the Academy Awards: Best Actor for Brando, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture.[235][240]Brando, who did not attend the Golden Globes ceremony two months earlier,[238][241]boycotted the Academy Awards ceremony and declined the Oscar,[38]becoming the second actor to decline a Best Actor award afterGeorge C. Scottin1971.[242][243]Brando sent American Indian Rights activistSacheen Littlefeatherin his place, to announce at the awards podium Brando's reasons for declining the award, which were based on his objection to the depiction of American Indians by Hollywood and television.[242][243][244]Pacino also did not attend the ceremony; he was allegedly insulted at being nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, when he had more screen time than his co-star and Best Actor-winner Brando, and thus should have received the nomination for Best Actor.[245]Pacino denies this, saying in his memoir,Sonny Boy,that he was ""scared"" of his sudden fame and never heard the rumor until much later in his life.[246]The Godfatherhad five nominations for awards at the26th British Academy Film Awards. The nominees were: Pacino forMost Promising Newcomer, Rota for theAnthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Duvall forBest Supporting Actor, and Brando forBest Actor, the film's costume designerAnna Hill JohnstoneforBest Costume Design.

Together with a succession of mob-theme imitators, it has resulted in a stereotyped concept of Italian-American culture biased toward the criminal networks.[citation needed]The first film had the largest effect. Unlike any film before it, its portrayal of the many poor Italians who immigrated to the United States in the early decades of the 20th century is perhaps attributable to Coppola and expresses his understanding of their experience. The films explore the integration of fictional Italian-American criminals into American society. Though set in the period of mass Italian immigration to America, the film explores the specific family of the Corleones, who live outside the law. Although some critics have considered the Corleone story to portray some universal elements of immigration, other critics have suggested that it resulted in viewers overly associating organized crime with Italian-American culture. Produced in a period of intense national cynicism and self-criticism, the film struck a chord about the dual identities felt by many descendants of immigrants.[283]The Godfatherhas been cited as an influence in an increase in Hollywood's negative portrayals of immigrant Italians, and was a recruiting tool for organized crime.[284]The concept of a mafia ""Godfather"" was a creation of Mario Puzo, and the film resulted in this term being added to the common language. Don Vito Corleone's line, ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"", was voted the second-most memorable line in cinema history inAFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotesby theAmerican Film Institute, in 2014.[285]The concept was not unique to the film. French writerHonoré de Balzac, in his novelLe Père Goriot(1835), wrote thatVautrintold Eugène: ""In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline.""[286]An almost identical line was used in theJohn WayneWestern,Riders of Destiny(1933), where Forrest Taylor states, ""I've made Denton an offer he can't refuse.""[287]In 2014, the film also was selected as the greatest film by 2,120 industry professionals in aHollywoodsurvey undertaken byThe Hollywood Reporter.[278]Gangsters reportedly responded enthusiastically to the film.[288]Salvatore ""Sammy the Bull"" Gravano, the formerunderbossin theGambino crime family,[289]said: ""I left the movie stunned ... I mean I floated out of the theater. Maybe it was fiction, but for me, then, that was our life. It was incredible. I remember talking to a multitude of guys,made guys, who felt exactly the same way."" According toAnthony Fiato, after seeing the film,Patriarca crime familymembers Paulie Intiso and Nicky Giso altered their speech patterns to imitate that of Vito Corleone. Intiso was known to swear frequently and use poor grammar; but after seeing the movie, he began to improve his speech and philosophize more.[290]In 2025,The Timesreported that recruits to theSicilian Mafiain Italy are now required by mafia bosses to watchThe Godfatherso they can learn the trade and because mafia bosses fear that new recruits ""lack a code of honour"".[291]Representation in other media[edit]The film has been referenced and parodied in various kinds of media.[292]John Belushiappeared in aSaturday Night Livesketch as Vito Corleone in a therapy session; he said of the Tattaglia Family, ""Also, they shot my son Santino 56 times"".[293]The crime drama television showThe Sopranoshas many film references. Most notably,Silvio Dante's topless bar is namedBada Bing!, a phrase popularized by James Caan's character Sonny Corleone inThe Godfather. Throughout the show, Silvio impersonates Al Pacino's character, Michael Corleone using quotes from the movie and its sequels.[25]In theanimated television seriesThe Simpsons, there have been many references to the film. For instance, in theseason 3episode ""Lisa's Pony"", Lisa wakes up to find a horse in her bed and starts screaming, a reference to Jack Woltz finding his prize racehorse's head in his bed. In theseason 4episode ""Mr. Plow"",Bart Simpsonis pelted with snowballs in mimicry of Sonny's killing.[294][295][296]The film's baptism sequence was parodied in ""Fulgencio"", the 13th episode ofseason 4of the comedy seriesModern Family, with Phil Dunphy standing in for Michael. The sequence also references the horse head scene when Phil's son Luke places a severed zebra head in the bed of a boy who had been making fun of him and had a fear of zebras. Phil also referencesGodfatherlines when he tells his wife Claire, ""Don't ask me about my business,"" and mentions an offer he can't refuse.[297]The 2006 video gameThe Godfatheris based upon this film and tells the story of Aldo Trapani, whose rise through the ranks of the Corleone family intersects with the plot of the film on numerous occasions.[298][299]Duvall, Caan, and Brando supplied voiceovers and their likenesses,[300]but Pacino did not.[300]Francis Ford Coppola openly voiced his disapproval of the game.[301]In the 2016 animated filmZootopiathe character Mr. Big is a parody of Vito Corleone.On April 28, 2022, a 10-episode drama seriesThe Offerpremiered onParamount+, about the production told from the perspective of producer Ruddy.[302]An episode of theanimated television seriesSpongeBob SquarePantsentitled ""The Goobfather"" from the 13th season has many scenes that directly parody this film.The 2023 filmBarbie, directed byGreta Gerwig, features a scene in which the characters watchThe Godfather, with Ken, portrayed byKingsley Ben-Adir, praising the film as a collective effort of Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Evans. A clip fromThe Godfatheris also shown, showing Marlon Brando in the opening scene of the film.[303]See also[edit]List of films set in Las VegasNotes[edit]^abSources disagree on both the amount of the original budget and the final budget.

JacksonUma ThurmanHarvey KeitelTim RothAmanda PlummerMaria de MedeirosVing RhamesEric StoltzRosanna ArquetteChristopher WalkenBruce WillisCinematographyAndrzej SekułaEdited bySally MenkeProductioncompaniesA Band ApartJersey FilmsDistributed byMiramax FilmsRelease datesMay 21, 1994(1994-05-21)(Cannes)October 14, 1994(1994-10-14)(United States)Running time154 minutes[1]CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$8–8.5 million[2][a]Box office$213.9 million[2]Pulp Fictionis a 1994 Americanindependentcrime filmwritten and directed byQuentin Tarantinofrom a story he conceived withRoger Avary.[3]It tells four intertwining tales of crime and violence inLos Angeles. The film starsJohn Travolta,Samuel L. Jackson,Bruce Willis,Tim Roth,Ving Rhames, andUma Thurman. The title refers to thepulp magazinesandhardboiledcrime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue.Tarantino wrotePulp Fictionin 1992 and 1993, incorporating scenes that Avary originally wrote forTrue Romance(1993). Its plot occursout of chronological order. The film is alsoself-referentialfrom its opening moments, beginning with atitle cardthat gives two dictionary definitions of ""pulp"". Considerable screen time is devoted to monologues and casual conversations with eclectic dialogue revealing each character's perspectives on several subjects, and the film features anironiccombination of humor and strong violence.TriStar Picturesreportedly turned down the script as ""too demented"".Miramax Filmsco-chairmanHarvey Weinsteinwas enthralled, however, and the film became the first that Miramax Films fully financed.Pulp Fictionwon thePalme d'Orat the1994 Cannes Film Festivaland was a major critical and commercial success. It was nominated for seven awards at the67th Academy Awards, includingBest Picture, and wonBest Original Screenplay; Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were nominated forBest Actor,Best Supporting Actor, andBest Supporting Actressrespectively. As a result of the film's success, Travolta's career was reinvigorated. The film's development, marketing, distribution, and profitability had a sweeping effect on independent cinema.Pulp Fictionis widely regarded as Tarantino'smagnum opus, with particular praise for its screenwriting.[4]The self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensivehomageandpastichehave led critics to describe it as a touchstone ofpostmodern film. It is often considered a cultural watershed, influencing films and other media that adopted elements of its style. The cast was also widely praised, with Travolta, Thurman, and Jackson earning high acclaim. In 2008,Entertainment Weeklynamed it the best film since 1983[5]and it has appeared on many critics' lists of the greatest films ever made. In 2013,Pulp Fictionwas selected for preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressas ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[6][7][8]PlotNarrative structurePulp Fiction's narrative is told out of chronological order and follows three main interrelated stories that each have a different protagonist: Vincent Vega, a hitman; Butch Coolidge, a prizefighter; and Jules Winnfield, Vincent's partner in crime.[9]The film begins with a diner robbery staged by a couple, then begins to shift from one story line to another before returning to the diner for the conclusion. There are seven narrative sequences; the three primary story lines are preceded by intertitles:""Prologue – The Diner"" (i)""Prelude to 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife'""""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife""""Prelude to 'The Gold Watch'"" (a – flashback, b – present)""The Gold Watch""""The Bonnie Situation""""Epilogue – The Diner"" (ii)If the seven sequences were ordered chronologically, they would run: 4a, 2, 6, 1, 7, 3, 4b, 5. Sequences 1 and 7 partially overlap and are presented from different points of view, as do sequences 2 and 6. According to Philip Parker, the structural form is ""an episodic narrative with circular events adding a beginning and end and allowing references to elements of each separate episode to be made throughout the narrative"".[10]Other analysts describe the structure as a ""circular narrative"".[11][12]Summary""Prologue – The Diner""A pair of thieves, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, reminisce on their past robbery attempts as they eat breakfast in a diner. Pumpkin proposes they rob the diner at that moment because he believes the patrons and employees will be unprepared to stop them. Honey Bunny agrees.""Prelude to 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife""Two hitmen, Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega, arrive at an apartment to retrieve a briefcase for their boss, influential local gangster Marsellus Wallace, from a business partner, Brett, and his friends. On the way, Vincent mentions that he had been tasked by Marsellus to take his wife,Mia Wallaceto dinner and asks Jules questions about Mia. After Vincent checks the contents of the briefcase, Jules shoots one of Brett's friends. Jules rebukes Brett over his attempt to double-cross Marsellus and recites what is portrayed as a passage from theBook of Ezekiel, before he and Vincent kill Brett.""Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife""Jules and Vincent give the briefcase to Marsellus, who bribes boxer Butch Coolidge tointentionally losein his upcoming match. Vincent purchases heroin from his drug dealer, Lance. He shoots up and drives to meet Mia, having agreed to escort her while Marsellus is out of town for the night. They eat at a 1950s-themed restaurant and participate in atwistcontest, then return home. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Mia finds his heroin, mistakes it for cocaine, and snorts it, resulting in anoverdose. Vincent rushes her to Lance's house, where Lance helps revive her by getting adrenaline for Vincent toinject into her heart. Vincent takes Mia home, and they agree never to tell Marsellus about the incident.""The Gold Watch""Butch double-crosses Marsellus by winning the bout, but accidentally kills his opponent in the process. He plans to flee with his girlfriend, Fabienne, but discovers she has forgotten to pack an heirloom: a gold watch which belonged to Butch's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. Returning to his apartment to retrieve it, he notices a gun on the kitchen counter and hears the toilet flush. Vincent exits the bathroom and Butch holds him at gunpoint, but accidentally shoots him dead and departs.While Butch is stopped at a traffic light, he sees Marsellus crossing the road. Butch rams his car into him and knocks him over, but is himself injured when his vehicle collides with another. Marsellus recovers, shoots at Butch and chases him into a pawnshop. Maynard, the shop owner, captures them at gunpoint and binds and gags them in the basement. Maynard and his accomplice, Zed, task theirgimpsex slavewith watching Butch while they take Marsellus into another room and begin torapehim. Butch breaks free and is about to escape, but decides to save Marsellus and arms himself with akatanafrom the pawnshop. He kills Maynard and frees Marsellus, who shoots Zed in the crotch with Maynard's shotgun. Marsellus tells Butch that he will call his crew to help him torture Zed to death and clean up the scene of their involvement. He further tells Butch that they are even and instructs him to tell no one about the incident and depart Los Angeles forever. Butch picks up Fabienne on Zed'schopperand they drive away.""The Bonnie Situation""In the apartment, after Jules and Vincent kill Brett, another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires at them. Every shot misses and they shoot him dead. Jules says that their survival was amiracle, which Vincent disputes, believing the man was just a lousy shot. While driving away with another one of Brett's friends, Marvin (who was actually a plant from Marsellus's organization), Vincent accidentally shoots him in the head when Jules drives over a bump in the road, covering Vincent, Jules, and the car interior in blood. They hide the car at the home of Jules's old friend and former business partner Jimmie, who demands they deal with the problem before his wife Bonnie comes home. Marsellus sends acleaner, Winston Wolfe, who directs Jules and Vincent to hide the body in the trunk, clean the car, dispose of their bloody clothes and take the car to a junkyard.""Epilogue – The Diner""At the diner from the film's prologue, Jules tells Vincent that he plans to retire from his life of crime, convinced that their survival at the apartment wasdivine intervention. While Vincent is in the bathroom, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny hold up the restaurant and demand Marsellus's briefcase. Pumpkin initially holds Jules at gunpoint, but Jules soon overpowers Pumpkin and holds him at gunpoint. Honey Bunny becomes hysterical and points her gun at Jules. Vincent returns with his gun aimed at her, but Jules defuses the situation. He recites the biblical passage, expresses ambivalence about his life of crime, and allows the robbers to take his cash and leave. Jules and Vincent leave the diner with the briefcase.CastMain CharactersJohn Travoltaas Vincent Vega:Jules' partner-in-crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Tarantino cast Travolta inPulp FictionbecauseMichael Madsen, who had played Vic Vega inReservoir Dogs(1992), chose to appear inKevin Costner'sWyatt Earpinstead. Madsen has since expressed regret over his decision.[13]Harvey Weinsteinpushed forDaniel Day-Lewisin the part.[14]Travolta accepted a reduced rate; sources say either US$100,000 or US$140,000. The film's success and hisAcademy Awardnomination for Best Actor revitalized his career.[15]Vincent is the brother of Vic Vega, also known as Mr. Blonde inReservoir Dogs, and in 2004, Tarantino discussed an idea for a movie starring Travolta and Madsen as the ""Vega Brothers""; the concept remains unrealized.[16]Samuel L. Jacksonas Jules Winnfield:Vincent's partner in crime, working for Marsellus Wallace. Jackson's first audition was overshadowed byPaul Calderón; Jackson had assumed the audition was merely a reading. Weinstein convinced him to audition a second time and his performance of the final diner scene won over Tarantino.[17][18]Jules was originally scripted with a giant afro,[19]but Tarantino'spersonal assistantmistakenly bought aJheri curledwig. Tarantino was enraged but Jackson persuaded him to keep it since the hairstyle had gained popularity through the rap groupN.W.A.[20]Film criticOwen Gleibermantook it as a ""tacit comic statement about the ghettoization of [Black people] in movies"".[21]Jackson received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Calderón appears in the film as Paul, a bartender at Marsellus's social club, as well as Marsellus's assistant. Tarantino wrote the role forLaurence Fishburne, who turned it down. According to Tarantino, Fishburne refused it because his team did not see it as a starring role;[22]Fishburne later said he turned it down because he felt the film glamorized heroin.[23]Uma ThurmanasMia Wallace:Wallace's wife and an aspiring actress. Miramax favoredHolly HunterorMeg Ryanfor the role of Mia.Alfre WoodardandMeg Tillywere also considered but Tarantino wanted Thurman after their first meeting.[24][25]She dominated the film's promotional material, appearing on a bed with cigarette in hand. She was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Despite being launched into the celebrityA-list, Thurman chose not to do any big-budget films untilBatman & Robin(1997) three years later.[26]Harvey Keitelas Winston Wolfe:A ""cleaner"" who aids Jules and Vincent. Tarantino wrote the part of Wolfe for Keitel, who had starred inReservoir Dogsand was instrumental in its production. In Tarantino's words, ""Harvey had been my favorite actor since I was 16 years old.""[27]Keitel had played a similarly employed character inPoint of No Return(1993).[28]Tim Rothas Ringo/""Pumpkin"":A burglar and Yolanda's boyfriend. Roth had starred inReservoir Dogsalongside Keitel. He had used an American accent inReservoir Dogsbut used his natural, London accent inPulp Fiction. Though Tarantino had written the part with Roth in mind, TriStar headMike MedavoypreferredJohnny DepporChristian Slater.[29]Early in development, Tarantino had contemplated casting Roth as Vincent andGary Oldmanas Jules, rewriting the characters as ""two English guys"".[30]Amanda Plummeras Yolanda/""Honey Bunny"":Ringo's girlfriend and partner in crime. Tarantino wrote the role of Yolanda for Plummer to partner her with Roth. Roth had introduced Tarantino to her, saying: ""I want to work with Amanda in one of your films but she has to have a really big gun.""[31]Maria de Medeirosas Fabienne:Butch's girlfriend. Tarantino met de Medeiros, a Portuguese actress, while traveling withReservoir Dogsaround the European film festival circuit.[32]Ving Rhamesas Marsellus Wallace:A crime boss and employer of Jules and Vincent. Before Rhames was cast, the part of Wallace was initially offered toMax JulienandSid Haig, but both turned down the role.[33][34]According to Bender, Rhames gave ""one of the best auditions I've ever seen"".[25]His acclaimed performance led to him being cast in big-budget features such asMission Impossible(1996),Con Air(1997) andOut of Sight(1998).[35]Eric Stoltzas Lance:Vincent's drug dealer.[36]Gary Oldman was the preferred choice among TriStar executives, based on his portrayal of drug-dealing pimp Drexl Spivey inTrue Romance(1993).[37][38]Rosanna Arquetteas Jody:Lance's wife.Pam Grierread for the role, but Tarantino did not believe audiences would find it plausible for Lance to yell at her.[39]Tarantino later cast Grier as the lead role forJackie Brown.Ellen DeGeneresalso read for the part of Jody.[40]Rosanna's sisterAlexis(then known as Robert Arquette) also appears in the film, as a man emerging from a bathroom to shoot at and miss Vincent and Jules who then kill him.Christopher Walkenas Captain Koons:AUSAFveteran of theVietnam Warwho delivers a young Butch his father's coveted gold watch. During Koons' monologue, which is interspersed with colorful descriptions of theViet Cong, he mentions a soldier called ""Winocki"".[b]Joe Winocki (John Garfield) is a character in the 1943 filmAir Forcedirected byHoward Hawks, one of Tarantino's favorite directors.[42]Tarantino played a character named Desmond Winocki in a guest appearance on an episode ofAll-American GirltitledPulp Sitcom.[43]Bruce Willisas Butch Coolidge:An aging boxer on the run from Marsellus after havingdouble-crossedhim. The role was originally written forMatt Dillonwho turned it down.[44]Willis was already a star but most of his recent films had been critical and box-office disappointments. As related byPeter Bart, participating in the modestly budgeted film ""meant lowering his salary and risking his star status but the strategy ... paid off royally:Pulp Fictionnot only brought Willis new respect as an actor but also earned him several million dollars"".[45][46][47]Willis' appearance and physical presence were crucial to Tarantino, ""Bruce has the look of a 50s actor. I can't think of any other star that has that look"".[48]Butch's look was modeled onAldo RayinNightfalland his demeanor based onRalph Meeker's portrayal ofMike HammerinRobert Aldrich'sKiss Me Deadly.[49]Chandler Lindauer plays a young Butch.Secondary CharactersBronagh Gallagherplays Jody's friend Trudi who does little but smoke abongduring the scene where Vincent revives Mia. According to author Jason Bailey, ""Quentin thought it would be funny to have this casual observer who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there"".[50]Phil LaMarrportrays Marvin, an associate of Jules and Vincent. LaMarr auditioned for Tarantino after both had done a show for an improv group a few months prior.[51]He read for the roles of Jules Winnfield and Brett before being cast as Marvin.[51]Tarantino appears as Jules' friend Jimmie, in whose house they clean up a murder. Tarantino was unsure whether to play Jimmie or Lance, choosing Jimmie as he wanted to be behind the camera during Mia's overdose scene.[38]Frank Whaleyportrays Brett, who has a briefcase requested by Marsellus. Whaley met Tarantino while he was filmingReservoir Dogsat a lab inSundance Institute. He recalls, ""we ended up meeting and spending time together, and I liked him, so I was really happy when he asked me to be in this movie.""[52]Burr Steersappears as Roger, a friend of Brett's nicknamed ""Flock of Seagulls"" by Jules. The scene of the confrontation between Brett and Jules went through several takes due to Steers making mistakes. Steers recalled in an interview that he had found acting difficult due to the loudness of the gunshots.[53]Angela Jonesportrays Esmarelda Villalobos, a cab driver who aids Butch's escape.

Avary recalls that their initial concept was to create three short films with three different filmmakers—himself, Tarantino, and a friend, Adam Rifkin.[56]Avary wrote the first element of what would become the film's screenplay in the fall of 1990,[57]titled ""Pandemonium Reigns,"" which eventually expanded into a feature-length screenplay. While Tarantino's short film similarly evolved into a full script, Rifkin never completed his contribution, leavingPulp Fictioninitially uncertain.[56]The initial inspiration was the three-part horroranthology filmBlack Sabbath(1963), by Italian filmmakerMario Bava. The Tarantino–Avary project was provisionally titled ""Black Mask"", after the seminalhardboiledcrime fiction magazine.[32]Tarantino's script was produced asReservoir Dogs, his directorial debut; Avary created the basis for the ""Gold Watch"" storyline ofPulp Fiction.[58][59][60][61]With work onReservoir Dogscompleted, Tarantino returned to the notion of a trilogy film: ""I got the idea of doing something that novelists get a chance to do but filmmakers don't: telling three separate stories, having characters float in and out with different weights depending on the story.""[62]Tarantino explains that the idea ""was basically to take like the oldest chestnuts that you've ever seen when it comes to crime stories – the oldest stories in the book ... You know, 'Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace's Wife' – the oldest story about ... the guy's gotta go out with the big man's wife and don't touch her. You know, you've seen the story a zillion times.""[9]""I'm using old forms of storytelling and then purposely having them run awry"", he says. ""Part of the trick is to take these movie characters, these genre characters and these genre situations and actually apply them to some of real life's rules and see how they unravel.""[63]In at least one case, boxer Butch Coolidge, Tarantino had in mind a specific character from a classic Hollywood crime story: ""I wanted him to be basically likeRalph MeekerasMike HammerinAldrich'sKiss Me Deadly[1955]. I wanted him to be a bully and a jerk"".[48]Tarantino went to work on the script forPulp Fictionin Amsterdam in March 1992,[64]possibly at the Winston Hotel in theRed Light District.[65]He was joined there by Avary, who contributed ""Pandemonium Reigns"" to the project and participated in its rewriting as well as the development of the new storylines that would link up with it.[58][59][60]Two scenes originally written by Avary for theTrue Romancescreenplay, exclusively credited to Tarantino, were incorporated into the opening of ""The Bonnie Situation"": the ""miraculous"" missed shots by the hidden gunman and the rear seat automobile killing.[66]The notion of the crimeworld ""cleaner"" that became the heart of the episode was inspired by a short,Curdled, that Tarantino saw at a film festival. He cast the lead actress,Angela Jones, inPulp Fictionand later backed the filmmakers' production of a feature-length version of the short, likewise titledCurdled.[67]The script included a couple of made-up commercial brands that often featured in later Tarantino films:Big Kahuna burgers(a Big Kahuna soda cup appears inReservoir Dogs) and Red Apple cigarettes.[68]As he worked on the script, Tarantino also accompaniedReservoir Dogsaround the European film festivals. Released in the United States in October 1992, the picture was a critical and commercial success. In January 1993, thePulp Fictionscript was complete.[69][70]Theadrenalinescene was inspired by the Martin Scorsese documentaryAmerican Boy: A Profile of Steven PrinceaboutTaxi Driveractor Steven Prince, who played arms dealer Easy Andy in the film. Prince recalls injecting adrenaline into the heart of a woman who overdosed, with the help of a medical dictionary and aMagic Marker.[71][72]FinancingTarantino and his producer,Lawrence Bender, brought the script toJersey Films. Before even seeingReservoir Dogs, Jersey had attempted to sign Tarantino for his next project.[73]Ultimately a development deal worth around $1 million had been struck: The deal gaveA Band Apart, Bender and Tarantino's newly formed production company, initial financing and office facilities; Jersey got a share of the project and the right to shop the script to a studio.[74][75][76][77]Jersey had a distribution and ""first look"" deal withColumbia TriStar, which paid Tarantino for the right to consider exercising its option.[47]In February,Pulp Fictionappeared on aVarietylist of films inpre-productionatTriStar.[78]In June, however, the studio put the script intoturnaround.[47]According to a studio executive, TriStar chiefMike Medavoyfound it ""too demented"".[79]There were suggestions that TriStar was resistant to back a film featuring a heroin user; there were also indications that the studio simply saw the project as too low-budget for its desired star-driven image.[80][81]Avary—who was about to start shooting his own directorial debut,Killing Zoe—has said that TriStar's objections were comprehensive, encompassing the script's fundamental structure. He characterizes the studio's position:""'This is the worst thing ever written. It makes no sense. Someone's dead and then they're alive. It's too long, violent, and unfilmable.' ... So I thought, 'That's that!'""[66]Bender brought the script toMiramax Films, the formerly independent studio that had recently been acquired byDisney.Harvey Weinstein—co-chairman of Miramax Films, along with his brotherBob—was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up.[82]Michael Shamberg, the executive producer, reflected on the bidding process, saying, ""Only Harvey [Weinstein] placed a bid. Harvey believed he was engaged in a bidding war, but he wasn't. Even now, whenever I seeBob Shaye, he expresses regret for turning downPulp Fiction. Quentin initially wanted to collaborate withMike Medavoy, given Medavoy's history with the greatOrionfilms. Ironically, when the opportunity arose, Mike deemed the script too violent.""[56]Pulp Fiction, the first Miramax Films project to get agreen lightafter theDisneyacquisition, was budgeted at $8.5 million, and at the end $500,000 was returned, bringing the final budget to $8 million.[a][56]According to Bender, a lower budget meant that the producers could maintain more control over the movie itself.[56]It became the first movie that Miramax Films completely financed.[83]Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week, regardless of their industry status.[84][47]The New York Timesreported, ""Most of the actors received relatively small salaries along with a percentage of the profits.""[85]The biggest star to sign on to the project wasBruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, he was still a major overseas draw. On the strength of his name, Miramax Films garnered $11 million for the film's worldwide rights, virtually ensuring its profitability.[86][87]CastingDanny DeVito, one of the film's executive producers,[88]recalls that Weinstein suggested castingDaniel Day-Lewis, who had just won anAcademy AwardforMy Left Foot. DeVito responded by stating that Tarantino wanted John Travolta and reminded Weinstein that he had final cut and cast approval. He later reflected: ""I think he [Weinstein] called me every name in the book, but of course, Quentin got what he wanted, and he was absolutely right, and the rest is history.""[56]Bender noted that during the casting process, while Samuel L. Jackson's initial audition was impressive, another candidate later delivered a performance that ""blew them away."" This prompted Bender to inform Jackson's agent that they might need to consider the other actor. The agent firmly insisted, ""No, no, no, you can't do that. Sam will come back."" Initially hesitant to ask him for another audition, Bender discovered that Jackson believed he was simply reading for the role, not auditioning, and his subsequent return resulted in an outstanding performance.[56]Tim Roth, initially interested in the role meant for Willis, suggested Amanda Plummer as a co-star, insisting she should have a gun as he thought it would be ""terrifying"" - a notion Tarantino later incorporated into the script.[56]Harvey Keitel played a crucial role in gettingReservoir Dogsmade and introduced Bruce Willis to Tarantino. Bender and Tarantino went to see him at his house in Malibu, where they learned that he could recite practically the entire movie ofReservoir Dogs,a movie he loved. After a conversation, Tarantino and Willis took a walk on the beach, where Willis revealed he'd read thePulp Fictionscript and expressed interest in playing Vincent or Jules. Tarantino encouraged him to read the script one last time with the Butch character in mind. Willis called Tarantino the next day and said, ""the shortest sentence in the Bible is, 'Jesus wept.' The shortest sentence in Hollywood is, 'I'm in.'""[56]FilmingWillis evoked one 1950s actor in particular for Tarantino: ""Aldo RayinJacques Tourneur'sNightfall[1956] ... I said let's go for that whole look.""[91]His boxing robe, designed byBetsy Heimann, exemplifies Tarantino's notion of costume as symbolic armor.[92]Principal photographycommenced on September 20, 1993.[93]The lead offscreen talent had all worked with Tarantino onReservoir Dogs–cinematographerAndrzej Sekuła,film editorSally Menke,production designerDavid Wasco, andcostume designerBetsy Heimann. According to Tarantino: ""[W]e had $8 million. I wanted it to look like a $20–25 million movie. I wanted it to look like an epic. It's an epic in everything – in invention, in ambition, in length, in scope, in everything except the price tag.""[94]The film, he says, was shot ""on50 ASAfilm stock, which is the slowest stock they make. The reason we use it is that it creates an almostno-grainimage, it's lustrous. It's the closest thing we have to 50sTechnicolor.""[95]The largest chunk of the budget – $150,000 – went to creating the Jack Rabbit Slim's set.[84][96]It was built in aCulver Citywarehouse, where it was joined by several other sets, as well as the film's production offices.[97]The diner sequence was shot on location inHawthorneat the Hawthorne Grill, known for itsGoogie architecture.[98]For the costumes, Tarantino took his inspiration from French directorJean-Pierre Melville, who believed that the clothes his characters wore were their symbolic suits of armor.[92]Tarantino cast himself in a modest-sized role as he had inReservoir Dogs. One of his pop totems,Fruit Brute, a long-discontinuedGeneral Millscereal, also returned from the earlier film.[99]The shoot wrapped on November 30.[100]BeforePulp Fiction's premiere, Tarantino convinced Avary to forfeit his agreed-on cowriting credit and accept a ""story by"" credit, so the line ""Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino"" could be used in advertising and onscreen.[24]MusicMain article:Pulp Fiction(soundtrack)Nofilm scorewas composed forPulp Fiction; Quentin Tarantino instead used an eclectic assortment ofsurf music,rock and roll,soul, andpopsongs.Dick Dale's rendition of ""Misirlou"" plays during the opening credits. Tarantino chose surf music as the basic musical style for the film, but not, he insists, because of its association with surfing culture: ""To me it just sounds like rock and roll, evenMorriconemusic. It sounds like rock and rollspaghetti Westernmusic.""[101]Tarantino planned to use apower popsong, ""My Sharona"" byThe Knack, during the film's rape scene, but ultimately discounted it.[55]Some of the songs were suggested to Tarantino by his friends Chuck Kelley and Laura Lovelace, who were credited as music consultants. Lovelace also appeared in the film as Laura, a waitress; she reprises the role inJackie Brown.[102]Thesoundtrack albumwas released along with the film in 1994. The album peaked on theBillboard200chart at number 21.[103]The single,Urge Overkill's cover of theNeil Diamondsong ""Girl, You'll Be a Woman Soon"", reached number 59.[104]Estella Tincknell describes how the particular combination of well-known and obscure recordings helps establish the film as a ""self-consciously 'cool' text. [The] use of the mono-tracked, beat-heavy style of early 1960s U.S. 'underground' pop mixed with 'classic' ballads such asDusty Springfield's 'Son of a Preacher Man' is crucial to the film's postmodern knowingness."" She contrasts the soundtrack with that ofForrest Gump, the highest-grossing film of 1994, which also relies on period pop recordings: ""[T]he version of 'the sixties' offered byPulp Fiction... is certainly not that of the publicly recognized counter-culture featured inForrest Gump, but is, rather, a more genuinely marginal form of sub-culture based around a lifestyle – surfing, 'hanging' – that is resolutely apolitical."" The soundtrack is central, she says, to the film's engagement with the ""younger, cinematically knowledgeable spectator"" it solicits.[105]Release and receptionRelease and box officePulp Fictionpremiered in May 1994 at theCannes Film Festival. The Weinsteins ""hit the beach like commandos,"" bringing the picture's entire cast over to France.[106]The film was unveiled at a midnight hour screening and caused a sensation.[107][108]It won thePalme d'Or, the festival's top prize, generating a further wave of publicity.[109]The first U.S. review of the film was published on May 23 in industry trade magazineVariety.Todd McCarthycalledPulp Fictiona ""spectacularly entertaining piece of pop culture ... a startling, massive success.""[110]From Cannes forward, Tarantino was on the road continuously, promoting the film.[87]Over the next few months, it played in smaller festivals around Europe, building buzz: Nottingham, Munich,Taormina, Locarno,Norway, andSan Sebastián.[111]Tarantino later said: ""One thing that's cool is that by breaking up the linear structure, when I watch the film with an audience, it does break [the audience's]alphastate. It's like, all of a sudden, 'I gotta watch this ... I gotta pay attention.' You can almost feel everybody moving in their seats. It's actually fun to watch an audience in some ways chase after a movie.""[112]In late September, it opened theNew York Film Festival.The New York Timespublished its review the day of the opening.Janet Maslincalled the film a ""triumphant, cleverly disorienting journey through a demimonde that springs entirely from Mr. Tarantino's ripe imagination, a landscape of danger, shock, hilarity and vibrant local color ... [He] has come up with a work of such depth, wit and blazing originality that it places him in the front ranks of American film makers.""[108]External videosCharlie Rose interview with Quentin Tarantino onPulp Fiction, October 14, 1994On October 14, 1994,Pulp Fictionwent into general release in the United States. As Peter Biskind described: ""It was not platformed, that is, it did not open in a handful of theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built, the traditional way of releasing anindie film; it went wide immediately, into 1,100 theaters.""[113]In the eyes of some cultural critics,Reservoir Dogshad given Tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence. Miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign: ""You won't know the facts till you've seen the fiction"", went one slogan.[114]Pulp Fictionwas thetop-grossing film at the US box officeits first weekend with a gross of $9,311,882, edging out aSylvester Stallonevehicle,The Specialist, which was in its second week and playing at more than twice as many theaters. The gross claimed by Miramax Films was disputed by others.Warner Bros.initially reported an estimated gross of $8.9 million forThe Specialist, with Bob Weinstein then reporting a gross forPulp Fictionof $9.1 million, claiming that the film was on another 100 screens that had previously been overlooked. Warner Bros. then updated their gross to $9.3 million, claiming they had made a calculation error.[115]Early Monday morning, Miramax Films reported a gross of $9.3 million with Warner Bros. reporting $8.9 million forThe Specialist, placingPulp Fictionfirst but other industry sources did not believe Miramax Films' numbers.Varietyestimated thatPulp Fictiongrossed $8.6 to $9 million for the weekend.[116]Against its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs,Pulp Fictiongrossed $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first Miramax film to surpass $100 million in the United States and Canada.[117]Worldwide, it took in nearly $213 million.[c]In terms of domestic grosses, it was the tenth biggest film of 1994, even though it played on substantially fewer screens than any other film in the top 20.[119]Popular engagement with the film, such as speculation about the contents of the precious briefcase, ""indicates the kind of cult status thatPulp Fictionachieved almost immediately.""[120]AsMovieMakerputs it, ""The movie was nothing less than a national cultural phenomenon.""[121]Abroad, as well: in Britain, where it opened a week after its U.S. release, not only was the film a big hit, but in book form its screenplay became the most successful in UK publishing history, a top-ten bestseller.[122]Critical responseOn thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 92% of 186 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9.3/10. The website's consensus reads: ""Injecting its compendium of crime tales with the patois of everyday conversation,Pulp Fictionis a cinematic shot of adrenaline that cements writer-director Quentin Tarantino as an audacious purveyor of killer kino.""[123]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted average scoreof 95 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[124]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.[125]The response of major American film reviewers was widely favorable.Roger Ebertcalled it ""a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations... The screenplay by Tarantino and Roger Avary so well-written in a scruffy,fanzineway that you want to rub noses in it – the noses of those zombie writers who take 'screenwriting' classes that teach them the formulas for 'hit films'"".[126]Richard CorlissofTimewrote: ""It towers over the year's other movies as majestically and menacingly as a gang lord at a preschool. It dares Hollywood films to be this smart about going this far. If good directors accept Tarantino's implicit challenge, the movie theater could again be a great place to live in.""[127]InNewsweek,David Ansenwrote: ""The miracle of Quentin Tarantino'sPulp Fictionis how, being composed of secondhand, debased parts, it succeeds in gleaming like something new.""[128]""You get intoxicated by it,"" wroteEntertainment Weekly'sOwen Gleiberman, ""high on the rediscovery of how pleasurable a movie can be. I'm not sure I've ever encountered a filmmaker who combined discipline and control with sheer wild-ass joy the way that Tarantino does.""[21]""There's a special kick that comes from watching something this thrillingly alive"", wrotePeter TraversofRolling Stone. ""Pulp Fictionis indisputably great.""[129]TheLos Angeles Timeswas one of the few major news outlets to publish a negative review on the film's opening weekend.Kenneth Turanwrote: ""The writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities.""[130]Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than toPulp Fictionitself. While not panning the film,Stanley KauffmannofThe New Republicfelt that ""the way that [it] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting.Pulp Fictionnourishes, abets, cultural slumming.""[131]Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work ofFrench New WavedirectorJean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature,Jonathan Rosenbaumof theChicago Readerwrote: ""The fact thatPulp Fictionis garnering more extravagant raves thanBreathlessever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful – namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand.""[132]Observing in theNational Reviewthat ""[n]o film arrives with more advance hype"",John Simonwas unswayed: ""titillation cures neither hollowness nor shallowness"".[133]Debate about the film spread beyond the review pages, with its violence often being the theme. InThe Washington Post, Donna Britt described how she was happy not to seePulp Fictionon a recent weekend and thus avoid ""discussing the rousing scene in which a gunshot sprays somebody's brains around a car interior"".[134]Some commentators took exception to the film's frequent use of the word ""nigger"" (mentioned 18 times). In theChicago Tribune, Todd Boyd argued that the word's recurrence ""has the ability to signify the ultimate level of hipness for white males who have historically used their perception of black masculinity as the embodiment of cool"".[135]In Britain,James Wood, writing inThe Guardian, set the tone for much subsequent criticism: ""Tarantino represents the final triumph ofpostmodernism, which is to empty the artwork of all content, thus avoiding its capacity to do anything except helplessly represent our agonies ... Only in this age could a writer as talented as Tarantino produce artworks so vacuous, so entirely stripped of any politics, metaphysics, or moral interest.""[136]Awards seasonAround the turn of the year,Pulp Fictionwas named Best Picture by theNational Society of Film Critics,National Board of Review,Los Angeles Film Critics Association,Boston Society of Film Critics,Society of Texas Film Critics, Southeastern Film Critics Association, andKansas City Film Critics Circle.[d]Tarantino was named Best Director by all seven of those organizations as well as by theNew York Film Critics Circle[143]andChicago Film Critics Association.[144]The screenplay won several prizes, with various awarding bodies ascribing credit differently. At the52nd Golden Globe Awards, Tarantino, named as sole recipient of the Best Screenplay honor, failed to mention Avary in his acceptance speech.[145]In February 1995, the film received seven Oscar nominations – Best Picture, Director, Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Jackson), Supporting Actress (Thurman), Original Screenplay, and Film Editing. Travolta, Jackson, and Thurman were each nominated as well for the1st Screen Actors Guild Awards, presented on February 25, but none took home the honor.[146]At the Academy Awards ceremony the following month, Tarantino and Avary were announced as joint winners of theAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[147]The furor around the film was still going strong: much of the March issue ofArtforumwas devoted to its critical dissection.[148]Pulp Fictiongarnered four honors at theIndependent Spirit Awards, held at the end of the month –Best Feature,Best Director,Male Lead(Jackson), andBest Screenplay(Tarantino).[149]At theBritish Academy Film Awards(BAFTA), Tarantino and Avary shared theBAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, and Jackson won forBest Supporting Actor.[150]The film was nominated for theGrand Prixof theBelgian Film Critics Association.[151]The February 2020 issue ofNew York MagazinelistedPulp FictionalongsideCitizen Kane,Sunset Boulevard,Dr. Strangelove,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,The Conversation,Nashville,Taxi Driver,The Elephant Man,In the Bedroom,There Will Be Blood, andRomaas ""The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars"".[152]Legacy and influencePulp Fictionquickly came to be regarded as one of the most significant films of its era. In 1995, in a special edition ofSiskel & Ebertdevoted to Tarantino,Gene Siskelargued that the work posed a major challenge to the ""ossification of American movies with their brutal formulas"". In Siskel's view,the violent intensity ofPulp Fictioncalls to mind other violent watershed films that were considered classics in their time and still are.Hitchcock'sPsycho[1960],Arthur Penn'sBonnie and Clyde[1967], andStanley Kubrick'sA Clockwork Orange[1971]. Each film shook up a tired, bloated movie industry and used a world of lively lowlifes to reflect how dull other movies had become. And that, I predict, will be the ultimate honor forPulp Fiction. Like all great films, it criticizes other movies.[153]Ken Dancyger writes that its ""imitative and innovative style"" – like that of its predecessor,Reservoir Dogs– representsa new phenomenon, the movie whose style is created from the context of movie life rather than real life. The consequence is twofold – the presumption of deep knowledge on the part of the audience of those forms such as thegangster filmsor Westerns, horror films or adventure films. And that the parody or alteration of that film creates a new form, a different experience for the audience.[154]John Travolta,Uma ThurmanandQuentin Tarantinoat the2014 Cannes Film Festival, for the film's 20th anniversary tribute.In a widely covered speech on May 31, 1995,Bob Dole, Senate Majority Leader andRepublicanpresidential candidate for the then-upcoming1996 presidential election(as well as the party's vice presidential nominee in the1976 presidential election), attacked the American entertainment industry for peddling ""nightmares of depravity"".Pulp Fictionwas soon associated with his charges concerning gratuitous violence. Dole had not mentioned the film, instead citing two less-celebrated movies based on Tarantino screenplays,Oliver Stone'sNatural Born KillersandTony Scott'sTrue Romance.[155]In September 1996, Dole did accusePulp Fiction– which he had not seen at the time – of promoting ""the romance of heroin"".[156]Paula Rabinowitz expresses the general film industry opinion thatPulp Fiction""simultaneously resurrected John Travolta and film noir"".[157]In Peter Biskind's description, it created a ""guys-with-guns frenzy"".[158]The film has also been labeled as ablack comedy[3]and a ""neo-noir"".[159][160][161]CriticGeoffrey O'Brien, however, argued against the classification ofPulp Fictioninto the neo-noir genre: ""The old-timenoirpassions, the brooding melancholy and operatic death scenes, would be altogether out of place in the crisp and brightly lit wonderland that Tarantino conjures up. [It is] neither neo-noir nor a parody of noir.""[162]Similarly,Nicholas Christophercalls it ""more ganglandcampthan neo-noir"",[163][164]andFoster Hirschsuggests that its ""trippy fantasy landscape"" characterizes it more definitively than any genre label.[165]Regardless, the stylistic influence ofPulp Fictionsoon became apparent. Less than a year after the picture's release, British critic Jon Ronson attended theNational Film School's end-of-semester screenings and assessed the impact: ""Out of the five student movies I watched, four incorporated violent shoot-outs over a soundtrack of iconoclastic 70s pop hits, two climaxed with all the main characters shooting each other at once, and one had two hitmen discussing the idiosyncrasies ofThe Brady Bunchbefore offing their victim. Not sinceCitizen Kanehas one man appeared from relative obscurity to redefine the art of moviemaking.""[166]Among the first Hollywood films cited as its imitators wereDestiny Turns on the Radio(1995), in which Tarantino acted,[153]Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead(1995),[167]and2 Days in the Valley(1996).[168]It ""triggered a myriad of clones"", writes Fiona Villella.[169]Internationally, according toDavid Desser, it ""not only influenced a British brand of noir, but extended the noir vision virtually around the world"".[170]Pulp Fiction's effect on film form was still reverberating in 2007, whenDavid DenbyofThe New Yorkercredited it with initiating the ongoing cycle of disordered cinematic narratives.[171]According toVariety, the trajectory ofPulp Fictionfrom Cannes launch to commercial smash ""forever altered the game"" of so-calledindependent cinema.[172]It ""cemented Miramax's place as the reigning indie superpower"", writes Biskind.[113]""Pulpbecame theStar Warsof independents, exploding expectations for what an indie film could do at the box office.""[173]The film's large financial return on its small budgettransform[ed] the industry's attitude toward the lowly indies ... spawning a flock of me-too classics divisions ... [S]mart studio executives suddenly woke up to the fact that grosses and market share, which got all the press, were not the same as profits ... Once the studios realized that they could exploit the economies of (small) scale, they more or less gave up buying or remaking the films themselves, and either bought the distributors, as Disney had Miramax, or started their own ... copy[ing] Miramax's marketing and distribution strategies.[174]In 2001,Variety, noting the increasing number of actors switching back and forth between expensive studio films and low-budget independent or indie-style projects, suggested that the ""watershed moment for movie stars"" came with the decision by Willis – one of Hollywood's highest-paid performers – to appear inPulp Fiction.[175]In 2024, on the film's 30th anniversary, the magazine wrote that the film ""revived the career of John Travolta, minted a star in Samuel L. Jackson and spawned a still-thriving cottage industry of knockoffs and imitation films.""[56]It has been described as a ""major cultural event"", an ""international phenomenon"" that influenced television, music, literature, and advertising.[169][176]Not long after its release, it was identified as a significant focus of attention within the growing community of Internet users.[177]AddingPulp Fictionto his roster ofThe Great Moviesin 2001, Roger Ebert called it ""the most influential film of the decade"".[178]Four years later,Time's Corliss wrote much the same: ""(unquestionably) the most influential American movie of the 90s"".[179]Several scenes and images from the film achieved iconic status; in 2008,Entertainment Weeklydeclared, ""You'd be hard-pressed, by now, to name a moment from Quentin Tarantino's film that isn't iconic.""[5]Jules and Vincent's ""Royale with Cheese"" dialogue became famous.[180]It was referenced more than a decade and a half later in the Travolta vehicleFrom Paris with Love.[181]The adrenalin shot to Mia Wallace's heart is onPremiere's list of ""100 Greatest Movie Moments"".[182]The scene of Travolta and Thurman's characters dancing has been frequently homaged, most unambiguously in the 2005 filmBe Cool, starring the same two actors.[183]The image of Travolta and Jackson's characters standing side by side in suit and tie, pointing their guns, has also become widely familiar. In 2007,BBC Newsreported that ""London transport workers have painted over an iconic mural by 'guerrilla artist'Banksy... The image depicted a scene from Quentin Tarantino'sPulp Fiction, with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta clutching bananas instead of guns.""[184]Certain lines were adopted popularly as catchphrases, in particular Marsellus's threat, ""I'm 'a get medieval on your ass.""[185]Jules's ""Ezekiel"" recitation was voted the fourth greatest movie speech of all time in a 2004 poll. One of the more notable homages to Jules's ""Biblical"" quote was one Jackson himself played a part in, near the end of 2014'sCaptain America: The Winter Soldier, Jackson's characterCol. Nick Fury, presumed dead, visits his own gravestone, on which, below Fury's name is inscribed ""The path of the righteous man ..."" Ezekiel 25:17.[186]In 2019, it was reported thatDominic Cummings,special political advisertoBritish Prime MinisterBoris Johnson, quoted Jules by telling Conservative MPs to ""be cool likeFonzies"" as political pressure built to request an extension to the date ofthe UK's withdrawal from the European Union.[187]Pulp Fictionnow appears in several critical assessments of all-time great films. In 2008,Entertainment Weeklynamed it the best film of the past quarter-century.[5]That same year, theAmerican Film Institute's ""Ten Top Ten"" poll ranked it number 7 all-time in the gangster film genre.[188]In 2007, it was voted 94th overall on theAFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movieslist.[189]In 2005, it was named one of ""Time's All-Time 100 Movies"".[179]As of September 2018, it is number 54 on Metacritic's list of all-time highest scores.[190]The film ranks very highly in popular surveys. A 2008Empirepoll combining the opinions of readers, movie industry professionals, and critics namedPulp Fictionthe ninth-best film of all time.[191]In a 2006 readers' poll by the British magazineTotal Film, it ranked as the number three film in history.[192]It was voted as the fourth-greatest film of all time in a nationwide poll for Britain'sChannel 4in 2001.[193]In 2015,Pulp Fictionranked 28th onBBC's ""100 Greatest American Films"" list, voted on by film critics from around the world.[194]Critical analysisTarantino has stated that he originally planned ""to do aBlack Maskmovie"", referring to the magazine largely responsible for popularizinghardboileddetective fiction. ""[I]t kind of went somewhere else"".[162]Geoffrey O'Brien sees the result as connected ""rather powerfully to a parallel pulp tradition: the tales of terror and the uncanny practiced by such writers asCornell Woolrich[and]Fredric Brown... Both dealt heavily in the realm of improbable coincidences and cruel cosmic jokes, a realm thatPulp Fictionmakes its own.""[195]In particular, O'Brien finds a strong affinity between the intricate plot mechanics and twists of Brown's novels and the recursive, interweaving structure ofPulp Fiction.[196]Philip French describes the film's narrative as a ""circular movement orMöbius stripof a kindResnaisandRobbe-Grilletwould admire"".[197]James Mottram regards crime novelistElmore Leonard, whose influence Tarantino has acknowledged, as the film's primary literary antecedent. He suggests that Leonard's ""rich dialogue"" is reflected in Tarantino's ""popular-culture-strewn jive""; he also points to the acute, extremely dark sense of humor Leonard applies to the realm of violence as a source of inspiration.[198]Film scholar/historianRobert Kolkersees the ""flourishes, the apparent witty banality of the dialogue, the goofy fracturing of temporality [as] a patina over apastiche. The pastiche ... is essentially of two films that Tarantino can't seem to get out of his mind:Mean Streets[1973; directed byMartin Scorsese, who lovedPulp Fictionand the way the film was told[199]] andThe Killing[1956; directed byStanley Kubrick].""[200]He contrastsPulp Fictionwith postmodern Hollywood predecessorsHudson Hawk(1991; starring Willis) andLast Action Hero(1993; starringArnold Schwarzenegger) that ""took the joke too far ... simply mocked or suggested that they were smarter than the audience"" and flopped.[201]Todd McCarthy writes that the film's ""striking widescreen compositions often contain objects in extreme close-up as well as vivid contrasts, sometimes bringing to mind the visual strategies ofSergio Leone"", an acknowledged hero of Tarantino's.[110]To Martin Rubin, the ""expansive, brightly colored widescreen visuals"" evoke comedy directors such asFrank TashlinandBlake Edwards.[202]The movie's host ofpop cultureallusions, ranging from the famous image ofMarilyn Monroe's skirt flying up over a subway grating to Jules addressing a soon-to-be victim as ""Flock of Seagulls"" because of his haircut,[203][204]have led many critics to discuss it within the framework ofpostmodernism. Describing the film in 2005 as Tarantino's ""postmodern masterpiece ... to date"", David Walker writes that it ""is marked by its playful reverence for the 1950s ... and its constantly teasing and often deferential references to other films"". He characterizes its convoluted narrative technique as ""postmodern tricksiness"".[205]Calling the film a ""terminally hip postmodern collage"", Foster Hirsch findsPulp Fictionfar from a masterpiece: ""authoritative, influential, and meaningless"". Set ""in a world that could exist only in the movies"", it is ""a succulent guilty pleasure, beautifully made junk food forcinéastes"".[206]O'Brien, dismissing attempts to associate the movie withfilm noir, argues that ""Pulp Fictionis more a guided tour of an infernal theme park decorated with cultural detritus,Buddy HollyandMamie Van Doren, fragments ofblaxploitationandRoger CormanandShogun Assassin, music out of a twenty-four-hour oldies station for which all the decades since the fifties exist simultaneously.""[162]Catherine Constable takes the moment in which a needle filled with adrenalin is plunged into the comatose Mia's heart as exemplary. She proposes that it ""can be seen as effecting her resurrection from the dead, simultaneously recalling and undermining theGothicconvention of the vampire's stake. On this model, the referencing of previous aesthetic forms and styles moves beyond ... empty pastiche, sustaining an 'inventive and affirmative' mode of postmodernism.""[207]Mark T. Conard asks, ""[W]hat is the filmabout?"" and answers, ""Americannihilism.""[208]Hirsch suggests, ""If the film is actually about anything other than its own cleverness, it seems dedicated to the dubious thesis that hit men are part of the human family.""[168]Richard Alleva argues that ""Pulp Fictionhas about as much to do with actual criminality or violence asCyrano de Bergeracwith the realities of seventeenth-century France orThe Prisoner of Zendawith Balkan politics."" He reads the movie as a form of romance whose allure is centered in the characters' nonnaturalistic discourse, ""wise-guy literate, media-smart, obscenelyepigrammatic"".[209]In Alan Stone's view, the ""absurd dialogue"", like that between Vincent and Jules in the scene where the former accidentally kills Marvin, ""unexpectedly transforms the meaning of the violence cliché ...Pulp Fictionunmasks the macho myth by making it laughable and deheroicizes the power trip glorified by standard Hollywood violence.""[210]Stone reads the film as ""politically correct. There is no nudity and no violence directed against women ... [It] celebrates interracial friendship and cultural diversity; there are strong women and strong black men, and the director swims against the current of class stereotype.""[210]Where Stone sees a celebration, Kolker finds a vacuum: ""The postmodern insouciance, violence, homophobia, and racism ofPulp Fictionwere perfectly acceptable because the film didn't pretend seriousness and therefore didn't mock it.""[201]Calling it the ""acme of postmodern nineties filmmaking"", he explains, ""the postmodern is about surfaces; it is flattened spatiality in which event and character are in a steady state of reminding us that they are pop-cultural figures.""[211]According to Kolker:That's whyPulp Fictionwas so popular. Not because all audiences got all or any of its references to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film's cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off – by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and airless nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.[212]Henry A. Girouxargues that Tarantino ""empties violence of any critical social consequences, offering viewers only the immediacy of shock, humor, and irony-without-insight as elements of mediation. None of these elements gets beyond the seduction of voyeuristic gazing ... [t]he facile consumption of shocking images and hallucinatory delight.""[213]Regarding the violence and nihilism in the film, Pamela Demory has suggested thatPulp Fictionshould be seen in light of the short stories ofFlannery O'Connor,[214]which likewise feature ""religious elements, banality, and violence with grotesque humor."" Discussing ""the connection between violence and redemption,"" Demory concludes that while O'Connor's purpose is to convince readers ""of the powerful force of evil in the world and of our need for grace,"" Tarantino ""seeks to demonstrate that in spite of everything we have seen in the film – all the violence, degradation, death, crime, amoral behavior – grace is still possible; there might still be a God who doesn't judge us on merits.""[215]Homage as essenceCinemaPulp Fictionis full ofhomagesto other movies. ""Tarantino's characters"", writesGary Groth, ""inhabit a world where the entire landscape is composed of Hollywood product. Tarantino is a cinematic kleptomaniac – he literally can't help himself.""[216]Two scenes in particular have prompted discussion of the film's highlyintertextualstyle. Many have assumed that the dance sequence at Jack Rabbit Slim's was intended as a reference to Travolta's star-making performance as Tony Manero in the epochalSaturday Night Fever(1977); Tarantino, however, credits a scene in theJean-Luc GodardfilmBande à part(1964) with the inspiration. According to the filmmaker;Everybody thinks that I wrote this scene just to have John Travolta dancing. But the scene existed before John Travolta was cast. But once he was cast, it was like, ""Great. We get to see John dance. All the better.""... My favorite musical sequences have always been in Godard, because they just come out of nowhere. It's so infectious, so friendly. And the fact that it's not a musical, but he's stopping the movie to have a musical sequence, makes it all the more sweet.[217]Jerome Charynargues that, beyond ""all the better"", Travolta's presence is essential to the power of the scene, and of the film:Travolta's entire career becomes ""backstory"", the myth of a movie star who has fallen out of favor, but still resides in our memory as the king of disco. We keep waiting for him to shed his paunch, put on a white polyester suit, and enter the 2001 Odyssey club in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, where he will dance for us and never, never stop. Daniel Day-Lewis couldn't have woken such a powerful longing in us. He isn't part of America's own mad cosmology ... Tony Manero [is] an angel sitting on Vince's shoulder ... [Vince and Mia's] actual dance may be closer to the choreography ofAnna Karina's shuffle with her two bumbling gangster boyfriends inBande à part, but eventhatreference is lost to us, and we're with Tony again ...[218]Estella Tincknell notes that while the ""diner setting seems to be a simulacrum of a 'fifties' restaurant ... the twist contest is a musical sequence which evokes 'the sixties,' while Travolta's dance performance inevitably references 'the seventies' and his appearance inSaturday Night Fever.... The 'past' thus becomes a more general 'pastness' in which the stylistic signifiers of various decades are loaded in to a single moment.""[219]She also argues that in this passage the film ""briefly shifts from its habitually ironic discourse to one that references the conventions of the classicfilm musicaland in doing so makes it possible for the film to inhabit an affective space that goes beyond stylistic allusion.""[219]The pivotal moment in which Marsellus crosses the street in front of Butch's car and notices him evokes the scene in which Marion Crane's boss sees her under similar circumstances inPsycho(1960).[220][221]Marsellus and Butch are soon held captive by Maynard and Zed, ""two sadistic honkies straight out ofDeliverance"" (1972), directed byJohn Boorman.[210]Zed shares a name withSean Connery's character in Boorman's follow-up, the science-fiction filmZardoz(1974). When Butch decides to rescue Marsellus, in Glyn White's words, ""he finds a trove of items with film-hero resonances"".[222]Critics have identified these weapons with a range of possible allusions:Hammer –The Toolbox Murders(1978)[223]Baseball bat –Walking Tall(1973);[222]The Untouchables(1987)[223]Chainsaw –The Texas Chain Saw Massacre(1974);[222][223]Evil Dead II(1987)[222]Katana(samurai sword) – many, includingSeven Samurai(1954);[222][223]The Yakuza(1975);[222]andShogun Assassin(1980)[223]At the conclusion of the scene, a portentous line of Marsellus's echoes one from the crime dramaCharley Varrick(1973), directed by another of Tarantino's heroes,Don Siegel; the name of the character who speaks it there is Maynard.[224][225][226][227]David Bell argues that far from going against the ""current of class stereotype"", this scene, likeDeliverance, ""mobilize[s] a certain construction of poor white country folk – and particularly their sexualization ... 'rustic sexual expression often takes the form of homosexual rape' in American movies.""[228]Stephen Paul Miller believes thePulp Fictionscene goes down much easier than the one it echoes: ""The buggery perpetrated is not at all as shocking as it was inDeliverance... The nineties film reduces seventies competition, horror, and taboo into an entertainingly subtle adrenaline play – a fiction, a pulp fiction.""[229]Giroux reads the rape scene homage similarly: ""in the end Tarantino's use of parody is about repetition, transgression, and softening the face of violence by reducing it to the property of film history.""[230]In Groth's view, the crucial difference is that ""inDeliverancethe rape created the film's central moral dilemma whereas inPulp Fictionit was merely 'the single weirdest day of [Butch's] life.'""[231](""American Medid it too,"" Tarantino observed. ""There's likethreebutt-fucking scenes inAmerican Me. That's definitely the one to beat in that particular category!""[232])Neil Fulwood focuses on Butch's weapon selection, writing, ""Here, Tarantino's love of movies is at its most open and nonjudgemental, tipping a nod to the noble and the notorious, as well as sending up his own reputation as an enfant terrible of movie violence. Moreover, the scene makes a sly comment about the readiness of cinema to seize upon whatever is to hand for its moments of mayhem and murder.""[223]White asserts that ""the katana he finally, and significantly, selects identifies him with ...honourableheroes.""[222]Conard argues that the first three items symbolize a nihilism that Butch is rejecting. The traditional Japanese sword, in contrasts, represents a culture with a well-definedmoral codeand thus connects Butch with a more meaningful approach to life.[233]Thebiker filmNam's Angelsis also shown with Fabienne characterizing it as ""A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.""[234]TelevisionRobert Miklitsch argues that ""Tarantino's telephilia"" may be more central to the guiding sensibility ofPulp Fictionthan the filmmaker's love for rock 'n' roll and even cinema:Talking about his generation, one that came of age in the '70s, Tarantino has commented that the ""number one thing we all shared wasn't music, that was a Sixties thing. Our culture was television."" A random list of the TV programs referenced inPulp Fictionconfirms his observation:Speed Racer,Clutch Cargo,The Brady Bunch,The Partridge Family,The Avengers,The Three Stooges,The Flintstones,I Spy,Green Acres,Kung Fu,Happy Days, and last but not least, Mia's fictional pilot,Fox Force Five.[235]""The above list, with the possible exception ofThe Avengers,"" writes Miklitsch, ""suggests thatPulp Fictionhas less of an elective affinity with the cinematic avant-gardism of Godard than with mainstream network programming.""[236]Jonathan Rosenbaum had brought TV into his analysis of the Tarantino/Godard comparison, acknowledging that the directors were similar in wanting to cram everything they like onscreen: ""But the differences between what Godard likes and what Tarantino likes and why are astronomical; it's like comparing a combined museum, library, film archive, record shop, and department store with a jukebox, a video-rental outlet, and an issue ofTV Guide.""[132]Sharon Willis focuses on the way a television show (Clutch Cargo) marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movieThe Deer Hunter(1978). Willis writes that ""when Captain Koons enters the living room, we see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruinedmasculinityin search of rehabilitation ... [T]he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze.""[237]Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a ""prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their bête noire: TV.""[236]Kolker might not disagree, arguing that ""Pulp Fictionis a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move through a series of long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend.""[212]Notable motifsThe mysterious 666 briefcaseVincent ""stares ... transfixed"" into the glowing case, as specified in Tarantino's screenplay.[238]Vincent's demeanor reinforces the allusion to the scene inKiss Me Deadly(1955) in which Lily Carver, a.k.a. Gabrielle (Gaby Rodgers), gazes into the glowing case.[239]The combination of the mysterious suitcase lock is 666, the ""Number of the Beast"". Tarantino has said there is no explanation for its contents – it is simply aMacGuffin, a pureplot device. Originally, the case was to contain diamonds, but this was seen as too mundane. For filming purposes, it contained a hidden orange light bulb that produced an otherworldly glow when the case was opened.[240]In a 2007 video interview with fellow director and friendRobert Rodriguez, Tarantino purportedly ""reveals"" the secret contents of the briefcase, but the film cuts out and skips the scene in the style employed in Tarantino and Rodriguez'sGrindhouse(2007), with an intertitle that reads ""Missing Reel"". The interview resumes with Rodriguez discussing how radically the ""knowledge"" of the briefcase's contents alters one's understanding of the movie.[241]Despite Tarantino's statements, many solutions to what one scholar calls this ""unexplained postmodern puzzle"" have been proposed.[120]A strong similarity has often been observed withRobert Aldrich's 1955film noirKiss Me Deadly, which features a glowing briefcase housing an atomic explosive.[231][242][243]In their review ofAlex Cox's 1984 filmRepo ManinThe Daily Telegraph, Nick Cowen and Hari Patience suggest thatPulp Fictionmay also owe ""a debt of inspiration"" to the glowing car trunk in that film.[244]In scholar Paul Gormley's view, this connection withKiss Me Deadly, and a similar one withRaiders of the Lost Ark(1981), makes it possible to read the eerie glow as symbolic of violence itself.[245]The idea that the briefcase contains Marsellus's soul gained popular currency in the mid-1990s. Analyzing the notion,Roger Ebertdismissed it as ""nothing more than a widely distributed urban legend given false credibility by the mystique of the Net"".[246]Jules' Bible passageJules ritually recites what he describes as a biblical passage,Ezekiel25:17, before he executes someone. The passage is heard three times – in the introductory sequence in which Jules and Vincent reclaim Marsellus's briefcase from the doomed Brett; that same recitation a second time, at the beginning of ""The Bonnie Situation"", which overlaps the end of the earlier sequence; and in the epilogue at the diner. The first version of the passage is as follows:The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.The second version, from the diner scene, is identical except for the final line: ""And you will know I am the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon you.""""And I will strike down ...""Conclusion of the ""Ezekiel 25:17"" monologue and Brett's murderProblems playing this file? Seemedia help.While the final two sentences of Jules's speech are similar to the actual cited passage, the first two are fabricated from various biblical phrases.[247]The text of Ezekiel 25 preceding verse 17 indicates that God's wrath is retribution for the hostility of thePhilistines. In theKing James Versionfrom which Jules's speech is adapted, Ezekiel 25:17 reads in its entirety:And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that Iamthe LORD, when I shall lay My vengeance upon them.[248]Tarantino's primary inspiration for the speech was the work of Japanesemartial artsstarSonny Chiba. Its text and its identification as Ezekiel 25:17 derive from an almost identical creed that appears at the beginning of the Chiba movieKarate Kiba(The Bodyguard; 1976), where it is both shown as a scrolling text and read by an offscreen narrator.[249][250]The version seen at the beginning ofThe Bodyguard(1976) is as follows:The path of the righteous man and defender is beset on all sides by the inequity of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the father of lost children. And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious anger, who poison and destroy my brothers; and they shall know that I am Chiba the Bodyguard when I shall lay my vengeance upon them!In the 1980s television seriesKage no Gundan(Shadow Warriors), Chiba's character would lecture the villain-of-the-week about how the world must be rid of evil before killing him.[251]A killer delivers a similar biblical rant inModesty Blaise, the hardback but pulp-style novel Vincent is shown with in two scenes.[252]Two critics who have analyzed the role of the speech find different ties between Jules's transformation and the issue ofpostmodernity. Gormley argues that unlike the film's other major characters – Marsellus aside – Jules is:linked to a ""thing"" beyond postmodern simulation ... [T]his is perhaps most marked when he moves on from being a simulation of a Baptist preacher, spouting Ezekiel because it was ""just a cool thing to say ..."" In his conversion, Jules is shown to be cognizant of a place beyond this simulation, which, in this case, the film constructs as God.[253]Adele Reinhartzwrites that the ""depth of Jules's transformation"" is indicated by the difference in his two deliveries of the passage: ""In the first, he is a majestic and awe-inspiring figure, proclaiming the prophecy with fury and self-righteousness ... In the second ... he appears to be a different sort of man altogether ... [I]n true postmodern fashion, [he] reflects on the meaning of his speech and provides several different ways that it might pertain to his current situation.""[254]Similar to Gormley, Conard argues that as Jules reflects on the passage, it dawns on him ""that it refers to an objective framework of value and meaning that is absent from his life""; to Conard, this contrasts with the film's prevalent representation of a nihilistic culture.[255]Rosenbaum finds much less in Jules's revelation: ""[T]he spiritual awakening at the end ofPulp Fiction, which Jackson performs beautifully, is a piece of jive avowedly inspired by kung-fu movies. It may make you feel good, but it certainly doesn't leave you any wiser.""[132]The bathroomMuch ofPulp Fiction's action revolves around characters who are either in the bathroom or need to use the toilet. To a lesser extent, Tarantino's other films also feature this narrative element.[256]At Jack Rabbit Slim's, Mia goes to ""powder her nose"" – literally; shesnorts cokein the restroom, surrounded by a bevy of women vainly primping. Butch and Fabienne play an extended scene in their motel bathroom, he in the shower, she brushing her teeth; the next morning, but just a few seconds later in screen time, she is again brushing her teeth – vigorously, after having given Butch ""oral pleasure."" As Jules and Vincent confront Brett and two of his pals, a fourth man is hiding in the bathroom – his actions will lead to Jules' transformative ""moment of clarity"". After Marvin's absurd death, Vincent and Jules wash up in Jimmie's bathroom, where they get into a contretemps over a bloody hand towel.[171]When the diner holdup turns into a standoff, ""Honey Bunny"" whines, ""I gotta go pee!""[257]As described by Peter and Will Brooker, ""In three significant moments Vincent retires to the bathroom [and] returns to an utterly changed world where death is threatened.""[258]The threat increases in magnitude as the narrative progresses chronologically, and is realized in the third instance:Vincent and Jules's diner breakfast and philosophical conversation is aborted by Vincent's bathroom break; an armed robbery ensues while Vincent is reading on the toilet.While Vincent is in the bathroom worrying about the possibility of going too far with Marsellus's wife, Mia mistakes his heroin for cocaine, snorts it, and overdoses.During a stakeout at Butch's apartment, Vincent emerges from the toilet with his book and is killed by Butch.In the Brookers' analysis, ""Through Vince ... we see the contemporary world as utterly contingent, transformed, disastrously, in the instant you are not looking.""[258]Fraiman finds it particularly significant that Vincent is readingModesty Blaisein two of these instances. She links this fact with the traditional derisive view of women as ""the archetypal consumers of pulp"":Locating popular fiction in the bathroom, Tarantino reinforces its association with shit, already suggested by the dictionary meanings of ""pulp"" that preface the movie: moist, shapeless matter; also, lurid stories on cheap paper. What we have then is a series of damaging associations – pulp, women, shit – that taint not only male producers of mass-market fiction but also male consumers. Perched on the toilet with his book, Vincent is feminized by sitting instead of standing as well as by his trashy tastes; preoccupied by the anal, he is implicitly infantilized and homosexualized; and the seemingly inevitable result is being pulverized by Butch with a Czech M61 submachine gun. That this fate has to do with Vincent's reading habits is strongly suggested by a slow tilt from the book on the floor directly up to the corpse spilled into the tub.[259]Willis readsPulp Fictionin almost precisely the opposite direction, finding ""its overarching project as a drive to turn shit into gold. This is one way of describing the project of redeeming and recycling popular culture, especially the popular culture of one's childhood, as is Tarantino's wont as well as his stated aim.""[237]Despite that, argues Fraiman, ""Pulp Fictiondemonstrates ... that even an open pulpophile like Tarantino may continue to feel anxious and emasculated by his preferences.""[257]AccoladesMain article:List of accolades received byPulp FictionPulp Fictionwon eight major awards from a total of twenty-six nominations, including aBest Original Screenplaywin at the67th Academy Awards.[109][147][150][260][137]Also, in the balloting by theNational Society of Film Critics,Samuel L.

The film tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who issentenced to lifeinShawshank State Penitentiaryfor the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in amoney launderingoperation led by theprison wardenSamuel Norton (Bob Gunton).William Sadler,Clancy Brown,Gil Bellows, andJames Whitmoreappear in supporting roles.Darabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over eight weeks. Two weeks after submitting his script toCastle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produceThe Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set inMaine,principal photographytook place from June to August 1993 almost entirely inMansfield, Ohio, with theOhio State Reformatoryserving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars for the role of Andy, includingTom Hanks,Tom Cruise, andKevin Costner.Thomas Newmanprovided the film's score.WhileThe Shawshank Redemptionreceived critical acclaim upon its release—particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman—it was abox-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many factors were attributed to its failure at the time, including competition from the filmsPulp FictionandForrest Gump, the general unpopularity ofprison films, its lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including sevenAcademy Awardnominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to $73.3 million.Over 320,000VHSrental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations andword of mouth, it became the topvideo rentalof 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock Entertainment byTurner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on theTNTnetwork starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after release, the film is still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of thebest-loved films by audiences. In 2015, the United StatesLibrary of Congressselected the film for preservation in theNational Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".Plot[edit]In 1947,Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne arrives atShawshank State Prisonto serve twoconsecutive life sentencesfor murdering his wife and her lover. He is befriended by Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, acontrabandsmuggler serving a life sentence, who procures for him arock hammerand a large poster ofRita Hayworth. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequentlyrapedby ""the Sisters"" gang, led by Bogs Diamond.In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about beingtaxed on an inheritanceand offers to help him shelter the money legally. After the Sisters beat Andy to near-death, Hadley cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to a minimum security hospital; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton assigns Andy to the prison's decrepit library, ostensibly to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, but in reality, to leverage Andy's financial expertise for managing the finances of the warden and other prison staff. Andy also starts writing weekly letters to thestate legislature, requesting funding to improve the library.Brooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, butcannot adjust to the outside worldand eventually hangs himself. After years of Andy's ceaseless letters, the legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording ofThe Marriage of Figaro; Andy playsan excerptover the public address system, experiencing a moment of personal freedom before he is punished withsolitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains to a dismissive Red that hope is what gets him through his sentence. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".In 1965, Andy and Red befriend Tommy Williams, a young inmate convicted of burglary. Andy helps Tommy pass hisGeneral Educational Developmentexam, and Tommy later reveals that his cellmate at another prison confessed to committing the murders for which Andy was convicted. When Andy informs Norton, the warden refuses to act. Although Andy promises to keep the money laundering a secret, Norton has Hadley kill Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt and sends Andy to solitary confinement. Norton then threatens to destroy the library, strip Andy of guard protection, and transfer him to harsher conditions if he refuses to continue with his scheme.A dishevelled Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months. He tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living inZihuatanejo, a Mexican town on the Pacific coast where he can start anew. He asks Red to promise, once he is released, to travel to a specific hayfield nearBuxtonand recover a package that Andy buried there. Red worries that Andy is suicidal, especially after learning that he asked a fellow inmate for a rope.At the next day'sroll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster ofRaquel Welchhanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking with him Norton's suit, shoes, and theledgercontaining evidence of the money laundering and corruption at Shawshank. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and withdraws over $370,000 of the laundered money from various banks,[a]before mailing the ledger to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.The following year, Red is paroled after serving 40 years, but struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter inviting him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy on a beach, and the reunited friends happily embrace.Cast[edit]Tim Robbinsin 2008 (left) andMorgan Freemanin 1990Tim Robbinsas Andy Dufresne: A banker sentenced to life in prison in 1947 for the murder of his wife and her lover[3]Morgan Freemanas Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding: A prison contraband smuggler who befriends Andy[4][5]Bob Guntonas Samuel Norton: The pious and cruel warden of Shawshank penitentiary[3]William Sadleras Heywood: A member of Red's gang of long-serving convicts[4][6]Clancy Brownas Byron Hadley: The brutal captain of the prison guards[7][8]Gil Bellowsas Tommy Williams: A young convict imprisoned for burglary in 1965[4][9]James Whitmoreas Brooks Hatlen: The elderly prison librarian, imprisoned at Shawshank for over five decades[10]The cast also includesMark Rolstonas Bogs Diamond, the head of ""the Sisters"" gang and a prison rapist;[11]Jeffrey DeMunnas the prosecuting attorney in Dufresne's trial; Alfonso Freeman as Fresh Fish Con;Ned BellamyandDon McManusas, respectively, prison guards Youngblood and Wiley; and Dion Anderson as Head Bull Haig.[4]Renee Blaine portrays Andy's wife, and Scott Mann portrays her golf-instructor lover Glenn Quentin.[12]Frank Medrano plays Fat Ass, one of Andy's fellow new inmates who is beaten to death by Hadley,[4][13]andBill Bolenderplays Elmo Blatch, a convict who is implied to be responsible for the crimes for which Andy is convicted.[14]James Kisicki and Claire Slemmer portray the Maine National Bank manager and a teller, respectively.[15][16]Analysis[edit]The film has been interpreted as being grounded inChristian mysticism.[17]Andy is offered as a messianic,Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank.[18]The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of theLast Supper, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the ""lords of all creation"" invoking Jesus' blessing.[19]Director Frank Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention,[20]but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film.[21]The discovery ofThe Marriage of Figarorecord is described in the screenplay as akin to finding theHoly Grail, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.[22]Early in the film, Warden Norton quotes Jesus Christ to describe himself to Andy, saying, ""I am the light of the world"", declaring himself Andy's savior, but this description can also reference Lucifer, the bearer of light.[23]Indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments as he sees fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of Satan.[3]The warden has also been compared to former United States PresidentRichard Nixon. Norton's appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon's. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those of which Nixon was accused.[24]Andy and Red's reunion was filmed at theSandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The location has been interpreted as a form of escape or paradise.Zihuatanejo has been interpreted as ananalogfor heaven or paradise.[25]In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name means ""peaceful"". The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised after Andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife's death.[25]Similarly, Red's freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red's story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy, who finds redemption.[26]While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, film criticMark Kermodewrote that it can also be interpreted as aNietzscheanform of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy's aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he can be seen as aZarathustra-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom.[25]Film criticRoger Ebertargued thatThe Shawshank Redemptionis an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy's integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.[27]Robbins himself believes that the concept of Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever ""jail"" someone finds themselves in, whether a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us.[28]Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or imprisoned, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life.[29]PhilosopherJean-Paul Sartredescribed freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red's belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money-laundering scam.[3]Many elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the filmGilda(1946), but this scene was originally intended to featureThe Lost Weekend(1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject that is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation.[30]Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses afilm reelto help fight them off.[31]At the end of the film, Andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately Shawshank.[32]Andy and Red's relationship has been described as a nonsexual story between two men[33]that few other films offer, as the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women.[34]Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.[3]Production[edit]Development[edit]Director Frank Darabont (pictured in 2011) bought the adaptation rights toThe Shawshank Redemptionfor $5,000 in 1987.Frank Darabont first collaborated with authorStephen Kingin 1983 on the short film adaptation of ""The Woman in the Room"", buying the rights from him for $1—aDollar Dealthat King used to help new directors build a résumé by adapting his short stories.[8]After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 forA Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors, Darabont returned to King with $5,000[35]to purchase the rights to adaptRita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, a 96-page novella from King's 1982 collectionDifferent Seasons, written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known.[36]Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could be turned into a feature film, Darabont believed it was ""obvious"".[8]King never cashed the $5,000 check from Darabont; he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: ""In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve.""[37]Five years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. He expanded on elements of King's story. Brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King's story.[8]Darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist.[38]Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of directorFrank Capra, includingMr. Smith Goes to Washington(1939) andIt's a Wonderful Life(1946), describing them astall tales; Darabont likenedThe Shawshank Redemptionto a tall tale more than a prison movie.[39]He also citedGoodfellas(1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script, and the prison dramaBirdman of Alcatraz(1962) directed byJohn Frankenheimer.[40]While later scouting filming locations, Darabont happened upon Frankenheimer who was scouting for his own prison-set projectAgainst the Wall. Darabont recalled that Frankenheimer took time out from his scouting to provide Darabont with encouragement and advice.[41]At the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box-office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-Castle Rock Entertainmentproducer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock Entertainment did not produceThe Shawshank Redemption.[8]Director and Castle Rock Entertainment co-founderRob Reineralso liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million[42]and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself.[8]Reiner, who had previously adapted King's 1982 novellaThe Bodyinto the 1986 filmStand by Me, planned to castTom Cruiseas Andy andHarrison Fordas Red.[8][43]Castle Rock Entertainment offered to finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that Castle Rock Entertainment could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway, but he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014Varietyinterview, ""you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do"".[8]Reiner served as Darabont's mentor on the project, instead.[8]Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film[2](taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits),[42]and pre-production began in January 1993.[39][b]Casting[edit]Clancy Brownat the 2015San Diego Comic-ConMorgan Freeman was cast at the suggestion of producer Liz Glotzer, who ignored the novella's character description of a white Irishman, nicknamed ""Red"". Freeman's character alludes to the choice when queried by Andy on why he is called Red, replying ""Maybe it's because I'm Irish.""[40]Freeman opted not to research his role, saying ""acting the part of someone who's incarcerated doesn't require any specific knowledge of incarceration ... because men don't change. Once you're in that situation, you just toe whatever line you have to toe.""[2]Darabont was already aware of Freeman from his minor role in another prison drama,Brubaker(1980), while Tim Robbins had been excited to work alongside Freeman, having grown up watching him inThe Electric Companychildren's television show.[41]Darabont looked initially at some of his favorite actors, such asGene HackmanandRobert Duvall, for the role of Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable;[40]Clint EastwoodandPaul Newmanwere also considered.[44]Tom Cruise,Tom Hanks, andKevin Costnerwere offered, and passed on the role[8]—Hanks due to his starring role inForrest Gump,[40]and Costner because he had the lead inWaterworld.[45]Johnny Depp,Nicolas Cage, andCharlie Sheenwere also considered for the role at different stages.[45]Cruise attended table readings of the script, but declined to work for the inexperienced Darabont.[8]Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horrorJacob's Ladder.[46]When Robbins was cast, he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographerRoger Deakins, who had worked with him onThe Hudsucker Proxy.[8]To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards,[33]and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.[2]Cast initially as young convict Tommy,Brad Pittdropped out following his success inThelma & Louise, and the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows.[2][8]James Gandolfinipassed on portraying prison rapist Bogs.[8]Bob Gunton was filmingDemolition Man(1993) when he went to audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producerNiki Marvinarranged for him to record a screen test on a day off fromDemolition Man. They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for hisDemolition Manrole. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film's early scenes until his hair regrew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character, which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins', allowing Andy to believably use the warden's suit.[38]Portraying the head guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown was given the opportunity to speak with former guards by the production's liaison officer but declined, believing it would not be a good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers.[47]William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of theTales from the Crypttelevision series, where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make.[48]Freeman's son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red inmug shotphotos,[40]and as a prisoner shouting ""fresh fish"" as Andy arrives at Shawshank.[49]Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility.[2][50]The novella's original title attracted several people to audition for the nonexistent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man indrag clothing.[42]Filming[edit]Ohio State Reformatory, also known as the Mansfield Reformatory, served as the fictional Shawshank prison.On a $25 million budget,[51]principal photographytook place over three months[8]between June and August 1993.[52][53]Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week.[8]Freeman described filming as tense, saying, ""Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those."" Freeman referred to Darabont's requiring multiple takes of scenes, which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film and featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, ""A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs.""[8]He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing the outside of the prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.[2]Marvin spent five months scouting prisons across the United States and Canada, looking for a site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail.[54]Marvin eventually chose theOhio State ReformatoryinMansfield, Ohio, to serve as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings.[53][54]The facility had been shuttered three years earlier in 1990,[55]due to inhumane living conditions.[53]The 15-acre reformatory, housing its own power plant and farm, was partially torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cellblocks.[53]Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden's office, were shot in the reformatory. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on asound stagebuilt inside a nearby shutteredWestinghouse Electricfactory. Since Darabont wanted the inmates' cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-builtsethoused in the Westinghouse factory,[53]except for the scene featuring Elmo Blatch's admission of guilt for the crimes for which Andy was convicted. It was filmed in one of the actual prison's more confined cells.[56]Scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboringAshland, Ohio.[57]Theoak treeunder which Andy buries his letter to Red was located nearMalabar Farm State Park, inLucas, Ohio;[44]it was destroyed by winds in 2016.[58]The Bissman Building inMansfield, Ohio, served as thehalfway housein which Brooks and later Red would reside following their release from prisonJust as a prison in Ohio stood in for a fictional one in Maine, the beach scene showing Andy and Red's reunion in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, was actually shot in the Caribbean on the island ofSaint Croix, one of theU.S. Virgin Islands.[59]The beach at 'Zihuatanejo' is theSandy Point National Wildlife Refuge,[60]a protected area forleatherback sea turtles.[61]Scenes shot inUpper Sanduskyincluded the prisonwood shopscene where Red and his fellow inmates hearThe Marriage of Figaro(the woodshop is now called the Shawshank Woodshop),[44]and the opening court scene which was shot at theWyandot CountyCourthouse.[60]Other shooting locations included Pugh Cabin inMalabar Farm State Park, where Andy sits outside as his wife engages in an affair,[62]Butler, Ohio, stood in for Buxton, Maine,[63]and the Bissman Building in Mansfield served as the halfway house where Brooks stayed following his release.[64]The shot of Andy standing in the thunderstorm, arms open and drenched in rain, is widely considered one of the most significant visuals in cinema.[65][66]For the scene depicting Andy's escape from the prison, Darabont envisioned Andy using his miniature rock hammer to break into the sewage pipe, but he determined that this was not realistic. He opted instead to use a large piece of rock.[65]While the film portrays the iconic scene of Andy escaping to freedom through a sewer pipe described as a ""river of shit"", Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designerTerence Marsh. The production team dammed the stream to make it deeper and usedchlorinationto partially decontaminate it.[49][65]Of the scene, Robbins said, ""when you're doing a film, you want to be a good soldier—you don't want to be the one [who] gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety.""[67]The scene was intended to be much longer and more dramatic, detailing Andy's escape across a field and onto a train, but with only a single night available to film the sequence, it was shortened to showing Andy standing triumphant in the water.[65][66]Of his own work, Deakins considers the scene to be one of his least favorite, saying that he ""over-lit"" it.[66]In response, Darabont disagreed with Deakins' self-assessment. He said that the time and precision taken by Deakins, and their limited filming schedule, meant he had to be precise in what he could film and how. In a 2019 interview, he stated that he regretted that this meant he could not film a close up of Robbins' face as he climbed down out of the hole from his cell.[65]As for the scene where Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off.[49]While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth inGilda(1946), they were originally intended to be watchingBilly Wilder'sThe Lost Weekend(1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. As the footage was too costly to procure fromParamount Pictures, producer Niki Marvin approachedThe Shawshank Redemption's domestic distribution rights-holderColumbia Pictures, which offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which wasGilda.[68]As filming took place mainly in and around the prison, scenes were often shot in near chronological order respective of the different eras depicted throughout the story. This aided the actors' performances as their real-life relationships evolved alongside those of their respective characters.[65]Darabont commented that the scene in which Andy tells Red about his dreams of going to Mexico, was one of the last filmed and one that he most revisited in recollecting on the film's production. He praised Robbins and Freeman for completing the scene in only a few takes.[41]Post-production[edit]The final cut of the theatrically released film runs for 142 minutes,[1]and was dedicated to the memory of Allen Greene, Darabont's former agent, who died during filming fromAIDS.[69]The film's first edit ran for nearly two and a half hours, which Glotzer considered ""long"", and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of Red adjusting to life after incarceration; Darabont said that in test screenings the audience seemed to be getting impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that Red would not make it.[33]Another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating Andy's escape tunnel; this was thought to slow down the action.[70]The film originally had acold openthat played out Andy's crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more ""punchy"" opening.[71]One scripted scene, which Darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule.[72]In the scene, a dreaming Red is sucked into the poster of Rita Hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the Pacific shore, saying ""I am terrified, there is no way home."" Darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.[73]In Darabont's original vision for the end of the film, Red is seen riding a bus towards the Mexican border, leaving his fate ambiguous. Glotzer insisted on including the scene of Red and Andy reuniting in Zihuatanejo. She said Darabont felt this was a ""commercial, sappy"" ending, but Glotzer wanted the audience to see them together.[8]Castle Rock agreed to finance filming for the scene without requiring its inclusion, guaranteeing Darabont the final decision.[74]The scene originally featured a longer reunion in which Andy and Red recited dialogue from their first meeting, but Darabont said it had a ""golly-gee-ain't-we-cute"" quality and excised it.[75]The beach reunion was test audiences' favorite scene; both Freeman and Robbins felt it provided the necessary closure. Darabont agreed to include the scene after seeing the test audience reactions, saying: ""I think it's a magical and uplifting place for our characters to arrive at the end of their long saga...""[74]Music[edit]Main article:The Shawshank Redemption (soundtrack)The film's score was composed byThomas Newman. He felt that it already elicited such strong emotions without music that he found it difficult to compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, ""Shawshank Redemption"", plays during Andy's escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a ""triumphal flourish"" and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. ""So Was Red"", played following Red's release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy's cache, became one of Newman's favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add harmonica—a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his message of hope. According to Darabont, harmonica playerTommy Morgan""casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take"", and this is heard in the finished film.[76]Newman's score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.[36]Release[edit]Theatrical[edit]Leading up to its release, the film wastest screenedwith the public. These were described as ""through the roof"", and Glotzer said they were some of the best she had seen.[8][77]It was decided to mostly omit Stephen King's name from any advertising, as the studio wanted to attract a ""more prestigious audience"", who might reject a film from a writer known mostly forpulp fictionworks such asThe ShiningandCujo.[78]Following early September premieres at theRenaissance Theatrein Mansfield, and theToronto International Film Festival,[15][79]The Shawshank Redemptionbegan a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film grossed $727,327 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to theCinerama Dome, but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask Castle Rock Entertainment for a refund.[8]While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from theLos Angeles Timespushed crowds away.[8][77]It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number-nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedyExit to Eden($3 million), and just ahead of the historical dramaQuiz Show($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas.[36][51]The Shawshank Redemptionclosed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million.[80]It was initially considered abox-office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors' cuts.[8]The film was also competing withPulp Fiction($108 million), which also premiered October 14 following itsPalme d'Oraward win, andForrest Gump($330 million),[35]which was in the middle of a successful 42-week theatrical run.[77]Both films would become quotable cultural phenomena. A general audience trend towards action films starring the likes ofBruce WillisandArnold Schwarzeneggerwas also considered to work against the commercial success ofThe Shawshank Redemption.[8]Freeman blamed the title, saying it was unmemorable,[8]while Robbins recalled fans asking: ""What was thatShinkshonk Reductionthing?"".[21]Several alternative titles had been posited before the release due to concerns that it was not a marketable title.[48]The low box office was also blamed on a lack of female characters to broaden the audience demographics, the general unpopularity ofprison films, and the bleak tone used in its marketing.[21][41]After being nominated for several Oscars in early 1995,[8]the film was re-released between February and March, earning a further $12 million.[80][41]In total, the film grossed $28.3 million in the United States and Canada,[51]and $45 million[81]from other markets for a worldwide total of $73.3 million. In the United States, it became the 51st-highest-grossing film of 1994, and the 21st-highest-grossingR-ratedfilm of 1994.[51]Post-theatrical[edit]Despite its disappointing box-office returns, in what was then considered a risky move,Warner Home Videoshipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States in 1995. It went on to become the top rented film of that year.[36][82]Positive recommendations, repeat customer viewings, and being well received by both male and female audiences were considered key to the film's rental success.[21]Ted Turner'sTurner Broadcasting Systemhad acquired Castle Rock Entertainment in 1993, which enabled his television channel,TNT, to obtain the cable-broadcast rights to the film.[35]According to Glotzer, because of the low box-office numbers, TNT could air the film at a very low cost, but still charge premium advertising rates. The film began airing regularly on the network in June 1997.[35][8]Television airings of the film accrued record-breaking numbers,[21]and its repeated broadcast was considered essential to turning the film into a cultural phenomenon after its poor box-office performance.[8]Darabont felt the turning point for the film's success was the Academy Award nominations, saying ""nobody had heard of the movie, and that year on the Oscar broadcast, they were mentioning this movie seven times"".[46]In 1996, the rights toThe Shawshank Redemptionwere acquired byWarner Bros. Pictures, following the merger of its parent companyTime Warnerwith the Turner Broadcasting System.[83]In the United Kingdom, the film was watched by1.11 millionviewers on thesubscription televisionchannelFilm4in 2006, making it the year's second most-watched film on subscriptiondigital television.[84]By 2013,The Shawshank Redemptionhad aired on 15 basic cable networks, and in that year occupied 151 hours of airtime, rivalingScarface(1983), and behind onlyMrs. Doubtfire(1993). It was in the top 15% of movies among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 on theSpike,Up,Sundance TV, andLifetimechannels. Despite its mainly male cast, it was the most-watched movie on the female-targetedOWN network. In a 2014Wall Street Journalarticle, based on the margins studios take from box office returns, home media sales, and television licensing,The Shawshank Redemptionhad made an estimated $100 million. Jeff Baker, then-executive vice president and general manager ofWarner Bros. Home Entertainment, said that the home video sales had earned about $80 million.[35]While finances for licensing the film for television are unknown, in 2014, current and former Warner Bros. executives confirmed that it was one of the highest-valued assets in the studio's $1.5 billion library.[85]That same year, Gunton said that by its tenth anniversary in 2004, he was still earning six-figureresidual payments, and was still earning a ""substantial income"" from it, which was considered unusual so many years after its release.[86]Reception[edit]Critical response[edit]Roger Deakins's cinematography was praised by critics,[87][88]and his work led to him winning theAmerican Society of Cinematographersaward forOutstanding Achievement in Cinematography.[89]The Shawshank Redemptionopened to generally positive reviews.[90][91][92]Some reviewers compared the film to other well-received prison dramas, includingBirdman of Alcatraz,Cool Hand Luke, andRiot in Cell Block 11.[93][94]Gene Siskelsaid that, likeOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,The Shawshank Redemptionis an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority.[94]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.[95]Entertainment Weekly'sOwen Gleibermansaid that Freeman makes the Red character feel genuine and ""lived-in"".[5]Janet MaslinofThe New York Timessaid that Freeman was quietly impressive, but lamented that Red's role in the film had limited range, restricted to observing Andy. She considered Freeman's commanding performance made him a much stronger figure than simply an observer. Maslin said that Freeman's performance was especially moving when describing how dependent Red had become on living within the prison walls.[96]Variety's Leonard Klady suggested that Freeman had the ""showier"" role, allowing him ""a grace and dignity that came naturally"", without ever becoming banal,[87]andThe Washington Post'sDesson Howecalled Freeman a ""master"" of comedic and poignant cadence.[97]EvenKenneth Turan'sLos Angeles Timesreview, which Glotzer credited with derailing the film's box-office success, praised Freeman, saying his ""effortless screen presence lendsShawshankthe closest thing to credibility it can manage"".[98]Of Robbins' performance, Gleiberman said that in his ""laconic-good-guy, neo-Gary Cooperrole, [Robbins] is unable to make Andy connect with the audience"".[5]Conversely, Maslin said that Andy has the more subdued role, but that Robbins portrays him intensely, and effectively depicts the character as he transitions from new prisoner to aged father figure,[96]and Klady stated that his ""riveting, unfussy ... precise, honest, and seamless"" performance anchors the film.[87]Howe said that while the character is ""cheesily messianic"" for easily charming everyone to his side, comparing him to ""Forrest Gump goes to jail"", Robbins exudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell the story.[97]The Hollywood Reporterstated that both Freeman and Robbins gave outstanding, layered performances that imbued their characters with individuality,[88]andRolling Stone'sPeter Traverssaid that the pair created something ""undeniably powerful and moving"".[93]Gunton and Brown were deemed by Klady as ""extremely credible in their villainy"",[87]while Howe countered that Gunton's warden was a clichéd character who extols religious virtues while having people murdered.[97]Maslin called the film an impressive directorial debut that tells a gentle tale with a surprising amount of loving care,[96]while Klady said the only failings came when Darabont focused for too long on supporting characters, or embellished a secondary story.[87]The Hollywood Reportersaid that both the directing and writing were crisp, while criticizing the film's long running time.[88]Klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by humor and unexpected events, would dampen the film's mainstream appeal, but the story offered a fascinating portrait of the innate humanity of the inmates.[87]Gleiberman disliked that the prisoners' crimes were overlooked to portray them more as good guys.[5]Turan similarly objected to what he perceived as extreme violence and rape scenes, and making most of the prisoners seem like a ""bunch of swell and softhearted guys"" to cast the prison experience in a ""rosy glow"".[98]Klady summarized the film as ""estimable and haunting entertainment"", comparing it to a rough diamond with small flaws,[87]but Howe criticized it for deviating with multiple subplots, and pandering by choosing to resolve the story with Andy and Red's reunion, rather than leaving the mystery.[97]Ebert noted that the story works because it is not about Andy as the hero, but how Red perceives him.[79]Deakins' cinematography was roundly praised,[87]withThe Hollywood Reportercalling it ""foreboding"" and ""well-crafted"",[88]and Travers saying ""the everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out ... you can almost feel the frustration and rage seeping into the skin of the inmates"".[93]Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing ""the moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls"".[5]The Hollywood Reportersaid of Newman's score, ""at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film's central theme"",[88]and Klady described it as ""the right balance between the somber and the absurd"".[87]Accolades[edit]The film was nominated for sevenAcademy Awards in 1995, the most for aStephen King film adaptation:[99]Best Picture(Marvin),Best Actor(Freeman),Best Adapted Screenplay(Darabont),Best Cinematography(Deakins),Best Film Editing(Richard Francis-Bruce),Best Sound(Robert J.

Burton),[100]andBest Original Score(Newman, his first Academy Award nomination).[76]It did not win in any category.[99]It received twoGolden Globe Awardnominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture for Freeman, and Best Screenplay for Darabont.[101]Robbins and Freeman were both nominated forOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Roleat the inauguralScreen Actors Guild Awardsin 1995.[102]Darabont was nominated for aDirectors Guild of Americaaward in 1994 for Best Director of a feature film,[103]and aWriters Guild of America Awardfor Best Adapted Screenplay.[104]Deakins won theAmerican Society of Cinematographersaward forOutstanding Achievement in Cinematography,[89]while producer Niki Marvin was nominated for a 1994Golden Laurel Awardby theProducers Guild of America.[104]Legacy[edit]TheShawshank treeafter being split by lightning in 2011. It had been a symbol of hope after its role in the film.Darabont later adapted and directed two other King stories,The Green Mile(1999) andThe Mist(2007).[105]In a 2016 interview, King said thatThe Shawshank Redemptionwas his favorite adaptation of his work, alongsideStand by Me.[106]The oak tree, under which Andy leaves a note for Red directing him to Zihuatanejo, became a symbol of hope for its role in the film, and is considered iconic.[58][107]In 2016,The New York Timesreported that the tree attracted thousands of visitors annually.[108]The tree was partially destroyed on July 29, 2011, when it was split by lightning, and news of the damage was reported by U.S. and international publications.[107][109]The tree was completely felled by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016,[107]and its vestiges were cut down in April 2017.[110]The remains were turned intoThe Shawshank Redemptionmemorabilia, including rock hammers and magnets.[111]The prison site, which was planned to be fully torn down after filming,[55][112]became a tourist attraction.[53]The Mansfield Reformatory Preservation Society, a group of enthusiasts of the film, purchased the building and site from Ohio for one dollar in 2000 and took up maintaining it as a historical landmark, both as its purpose as a prison and as the filming site.[55][113]A 2019 report estimated the attraction to be earning $16 million in annual revenue.[41]Many of the rooms and props remain there, including the false pipe through which Andy escapes,[55]and a portion of the oak tree from the finale, after it was damaged in 2011.[44]The surrounding area is also visited by fans, while local businesses market ""Shawshanwiches"" andBundt cakesin the shape of the prison.[55]According to the Mansfield/Richland County Convention and Visitors Bureau (later renamed Destination Mansfield),[59]tourism in the area had increased every year sinceThe Shawshank Redemptionpremiered, and in 2013 drew in 18,000 visitors and over $3 million to the local economy.[44]As of 2019, Destination Mansfield operates the Shawshank Trail, a series of 15 marked stops around locations related to the film across Mansfield, Ashland, Upper Sandusky, and St Croix. The trail earned $16.9 million in revenue in 2018.[59][114]In late August 2014, a series of events was held in Mansfield to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary including a screening of the film at the Renaissance Theatre, a bus tour of certain filming locations, and a cocktail party at the reformatory. Cast from the film attended some of the events, including Gunton, Scott Mann, Renee Blaine, and James Kisicki.[15]The 25th anniversary was similarly celebrated in August 2019.[115]Guests included Darabont, Blaine, Mann, Gunton, Alfonso Freeman,[114]Bellows, Rolston, Claire Slemmer,[116]and Frank Medrano.[117]Darabont stated that only at this event, the first time he had returned to Mansfield, was he able to realize the lasting impact of the film, stating, ""It is a very surreal feeling to be back all these years later and people are still talking about it.""[112]Critical reassessment[edit]Contemporaryreview aggregationwebsiteRotten Tomatoesgives the film an 89% approval rating from 146 critics, with anaveragerating of 8.30/10. The consensus reads, ""Steeped in old-fashioned storytelling and given evergreen humanity by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins,The Shawshank Redemptionchronicles the hardship of incarceration patiently enough to come by its uplift honestly.""[118]The film also has a score of 82 out of 100 onMetacriticbased on 22 critics indicating ""universal acclaim"".[119]In 1999, film critic Roger Ebert listedShawshankon his list ofThe Great Movies.[92]TheAmerican Film Instituteranked the film number 72 on its 2007AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)list, outrankingForrest Gump(76) andPulp Fiction(94) which were released the same year.[120][121]It was also number 23 onAFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers(2006) list charting inspiring films.[122]In 2005, theWriters Guild of Americalisted Darabont's screenplay at number 22 on its list of the 101 greatest screenplays,[123]and in 2006,Film4listed it number 13 on its list of50 Films to See Before You Die.[124]In 2014,The Shawshank Redemptionwas named Hollywood's fourth-favorite film, based on a survey of 2,120 Hollywood-based entertainment industry members; entertainment lawyers skewed the most towards the film.[125]In 2017,The Daily Telegraphnamed it the 17th-best prison film ever made,[126]andUSA Todaylisted it as one of the 50 best films of all time.[127]In 2019,GamesRadar+listed its ending as one of the best of all time.[128]The Shawshank Redemptionappeared on several lists of the greatest films of the 1990s, by outlets including:PasteandNME(2012),[129][130]Complex(2013),[131]CHUD.com(2014),[132]MSN(2015),[133]TheWrap,[134]Maxim,[135]andRolling Stone(all 2017).[136]Cultural influence[edit]In November 2014, theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciencescelebrated the film's 20th anniversary with a special one-night screening at theSamuel Goldwyn TheaterinBeverly Hills, California.[46]In 2015, the film was selected by the United StatesLibrary of Congressto be preserved in theNational Film Registryfor being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Darabont responded: ""I can think of no greater honor than forThe Shawshank Redemptionto be considered part of our country's cinematic legacy.""[90]Varietysaid that the word ""Shawshank"" could be used to instantly convey images of a prison.[36]The significant and enduring public appreciation for the film has often been difficult for critics to define.[90]In an interview, Freeman said, ""About everywhere you go, people say,'The Shawshank Redemption—greatest movie I ever saw'"" and that such praise ""Just comes out of them"". Robbins said, ""I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, there are people who say, 'That movie changed my life'"".[8]In a separate interview, Stephen King said, ""If that isn't the best [adaptation of my works], it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it.""[137]In a 2014Varietyarticle, Robbins claimed that South African politicianNelson Mandelatold him about his love for the film,[8]while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen includingJonny Wilkinson(UK),Agustín Pichot(Argentina),Al Charron(Canada), andDan Lyle(USA),[138]andSarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.[139]Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America,[140]Germany, France, andBora Bora.[38]DirectorSteven Spielbergsaid that the film was ""a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe"".[40]Speaking on the film's 25th anniversary, Darabont said that older generations were sharing it with younger generations, contributing to its longevity.[41]It has been the number-one film onIMDb'suser-generatedTop 250since 2008, when it surpassedThe Godfather, having remained at or near the top since the late 1990s.[8][78]In the United Kingdom, readers ofEmpirevoted the film as the best of the 1990s, the greatest film of all time in 2006, and it placed number four onEmpire's 2008 list of ""The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time"" and their 2017 list of ""The 100 Greatest Movies"".[21][141][142][143]In March 2011, the film was voted byBBC Radio 1andBBC Radio 1Xtralisteners as their favorite film of all time.[144]It regularly appears onEmpire's top 100 films, was named the greatest film to not win the Academy Award for Best Picture in a 2013 poll bySky UK(it lost toForrest Gump),[145]and ranked as Britain's favorite film in a 2015YouGovpoll. When theBritish Film Instituteanalyzed the demographic breakdown of the YouGov poll, it noted thatThe Shawshank Redemptionwas not the top-ranked film in any group, but was the only film to appear in the top 15 of every age group, suggesting it is able to connect with every polled age group, unlikePulp Fictionwhich fared better with younger voters, andGone with the Wind(1939) with older voters.[77]A 2017 poll conducted byGatwick Airportalso identified the film as the fourth-best to watch while in flight.[146]When English film criticMark Kermodeinterviewed a host of United States moviegoers, they compared it to a ""religious experience"".[77]It was also voted asNew Zealand's favorite film in a 2015 poll.[147]Lasting fan appreciation has led to it being considered one of the most beloved films of all time.[8][36][114][148][149]See also[edit]List of cult filmsNotes[edit]^The $370,000 Andy takes in 1966 is equivalent to $3.59 million in 2024.^The 1994 budget of $25million is equivalent to $53 million in 2024.References[edit]Citations[edit]^ab""The Shawshank Redemption"".British Board of Film Classification.Archivedfrom the original on January 21, 2015.

The film starsLeonardo DiCaprioas a professional thief who steals information by infiltrating thesubconsciousof his targets. He is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased as payment for the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious. Theensemble castincludesKen Watanabe,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Marion Cotillard,Elliot Page,[a]Tom Hardy,Cillian Murphy,Tom Berenger,Dileep Rao, andMichael Caine.After the 2002 completion ofInsomnia, Nolan presented toWarner Bros.a written 80-pagetreatmentfor ahorror filmenvisioning ""dream stealers,"" based onlucid dreaming. Deciding he needed more experience before tackling a production of this magnitude and complexity, Nolan shelved the project and instead worked on 2005'sBatman Begins, 2006'sThe Prestige, and 2008'sThe Dark Knight. The treatment was revised over six months and was purchased by Warner in February 2009.Inceptionwas filmed in six countries, beginning in Tokyo on June 19 and ending in Canada on November 22. Its official budget was $160 million, split betweenWarner Bros.andLegendary. Nolan's reputation and success withThe Dark Knighthelped secure the film's US$100 million in advertising expenditure.Inception's premiere was held inLondonon July 8, 2010; it was released in both conventional andIMAXtheaters beginning on July 16, 2010.Inceptiongrossed over $837 million worldwide, becoming thefourth-highest-grossing film of 2010. Considered one of the best films of the 2010s and the 21st century,[4][5]Inception, among itsnumerous accolades, won fourOscars(Best Cinematography,Best Sound Editing,Best Sound Mixing,Best Visual Effects) and was nominated for four more (Best Picture,Best Original Screenplay,Best Art Direction,Best Original Score) at the83rd Academy Awards.Plot[edit]Dom Cobb and Arthur are ""extractors"" who performcorporate espionageusing experimental dream-sharing technology to infiltrate their targets'subconsciousand extract information. Their latest target, Saito, is impressed with Cobb's ability tolayer multiple dreams within each other. He offers to hire Cobb for the ostensibly impossible job of implanting an idea into a person's subconscious; performing ""inception"" on Robert Fischer, the son of Saito's competitor Maurice Fischer, with the idea to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to clear Cobb's criminal status, allowing him to return home to his children.Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: a forger named Eames, a chemist named Yusuf, and a college student named Ariadne. Ariadne is tasked with designing the dream's architecture, something Cobb himself cannot do for fear of being sabotaged by his mind's projection of his late wife, Mal. Maurice Fischer dies, and the team sedates Robert Fischer into a three-layer shared dream on an airplane to America bought by Saito. Time on each layer runs slower than the layer above, with one member staying behind on each to perform a music-synchronized ""kick"" (using the French song ""Non, je ne regrette rien"") to awaken dreamers on all three levels simultaneously.The team abducts Robert in a city on the first level, but his trained subconscious projections attack them. After Saito is wounded, Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would usually awaken dreamers, Yusuf's sedatives will instead send them into ""Limbo"": a world of infinite subconscious. Eames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to introduce the idea of an alternate will to dissolve the company.Cobb tells Ariadne that he and Mal entered Limbo while experimenting with dream-sharing, experiencing fifty years in one night due to the time dilation with reality. After waking up, Mal still believed she was dreaming. Attempting to ""wake up,"" she committed suicide and framed Cobb for her murder to force him to do the same. Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children behind.Yusuf drives the team around the first level as they are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that Browning has kidnapped him to stop the dissolution and that Cobb is a defensive projection, leading Robert to another third level deeper as part of a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious.In the third level, the team infiltrates an alpine fortress with a projection of Maurice inside, where the inception itself can be performed. However, Yusuf performs his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, forcing Arthur and Eames to improvise a new set of kicks synchronized with them hitting the water by rigging an elevator and the fortress, respectively, with explosives. Mal then appears and kills Robert before he can be subjected to the inception, and he and Saito are lost in Limbo, forcing Cobb and Ariadne to rescue them in time for Robert's inception and Eames's kick. Cobb reveals that during their time in Limbo, Mal refused to return to reality; Cobb had to convince her it was only a dream, accidentally incepting in her the belief that the real world was still a dream. Cobb makes peace with his part in Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Robert up with a kick.Revived into the third level, Robert discovers the planted idea: his dying father telling him to create something for himself. While Cobb searches for Saito in Limbo, the others ride the synced kicks back to reality. Cobb finds an aged Saito and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awaken on the plane, and Saito makes a phone call. Arriving inLos Angeles, Cobb passes the immigration checkpoint, and his father-in-law accompanies him to his home. Cobb uses Mal's ""totem"" – atopthat spins indefinitely in a dream – to test if he is indeed in the real world, but he chooses not to observe the result and instead joins his children.Cast[edit]The cast at a premiere for the film in July 2010. From left to right: Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elliot Page, Ken Watanabe, Michael Caine, and Leonardo DiCaprioLeonardo DiCaprioas Dom Cobb, a professional thief who specializes inconningsecrets from his victims by infiltrating their dreams. DiCaprio was the first actor to be cast in the film.[6]Brad PittandWill Smithwere the top two choices and were offered the role, according toThe Hollywood Reporter.[7]Smith turned it down because he didn't understand it.[8]Cobb's role is compared to ""the haunted widower in a Gothic romance"".[9]Ken Watanabeas Saito, a Japanese businessman who employs Cobb for the team's mission. Nolan wrote the role with Watanabe in mind, as he wanted to work with him again afterBatman Begins.[10]: 10Inceptionis Watanabe's first work in a contemporary setting where his primary language is English. Watanabe tried to emphasize a different characteristic of Saito in every dream level: ""First chapter in my castle, I pick up some hidden feelings of the cycle. It's magical, powerful and then the first dream. And back to the second chapter, in the old hotel, I pick up [being] sharp and more calm and smart and it's a little bit [of a] different process to make up the character of any movie"".[11]Joseph Gordon-Levittas Arthur, Cobb's partner who manages and researches the missions. Gordon-Levitt compared Arthur to the producer of Cobb's art, ""the one saying, 'Okay, you have your vision; now I'm going to figure out how to make all the nuts and bolts work so you can do your thing'"".[10]: 7The actor did all but one of his stunt scenes and said the preparation ""was a challenge and it would have to be for it to look real"".[12]James Francowas in talks with Christopher Nolan to play Arthur, but was ultimately unavailable due to scheduling conflicts.[13]Marion Cotillardas Mal, Cobb's deceased wife. She is a manifestation of Cobb's guilt about the real cause of Mal's suicide. He is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor.[14]Nolan described Mal as ""the essence of thefemme fatale,"" and DiCaprio praised Cotillard's performance, saying that ""she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character"".[10]Elliot Page[a]as Ariadne, agraduate studentof architecture who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes, which are described as mazes. The nameAriadnealludes to a princess ofGreek myth, daughter of KingMinos, who aided the heroTheseusby giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of theMinotaur. Nolan said that Page was chosen for being a ""perfect combination of freshness and savvy and maturity beyond [his] years"".[10]: 8Page said their character acts as a proxy to the audience, as ""she's just learning about these ideas and, in essence, assists the audience in learning about dream sharing"".[15]Tom Hardyas Eames, a sharp-tongued associate of Cobb. He is referred to as afencebut his specialty is forgery, more accurately identity theft. Eames uses his ability toimpersonate othersinside the dream world in order to manipulate Fischer. Hardy described his character as ""an old,Graham Greene-type diplomat; sort of faded, shabby, grandeur—the old Shakespeare lovey mixed with somebody fromHer Majesty's Special Forces"", who wears ""campy, old money"" costumes.[16]Cillian Murphyas Robert Fischer, the heir to a business empire and the team's target.[10]: 10Murphy said Fischer was portrayed as ""a petulant child who's in need of a lot of attention from his father, he has everything he could ever want materially, but he's deeply lacking emotionally"". The actor also researched the sons ofRupert Murdoch, ""to add to that the idea of living in the shadow of someone so immensely powerful"".[17]Tom Berengeras Peter Browning, Robert Fischer'sgodfatherand fellow executive at the Fischers' company.[18]Berenger said Browning acts as a ""surrogate father"" to Fischer, who calls the character ""Uncle Peter"", and emphasized that ""Browning has been with [Robert] his whole life and has probably spent more quality time with him than his own father"".[10]: 11Michael Caineas Stephen Miles, Cobb's mentor and father-in-law,[10]: 11and Ariadne's college professor who recommends her to the team.[19]Dileep Raoas Yusuf. Rao describes Yusuf as ""an avant-garde pharmacologist, who is a resource for people, like Cobb, who want to do this work unsupervised, unregistered and unapproved of by anyone"". Co-producer Jordan Goldberg said the role of the chemist was ""particularly tough because you don't want him to seem like some kind of drug dealer"", and that Rao was cast for being ""funny, interesting and obviously smart"".[10]: 11Lukas Haasas Nash, an architect in Cobb's employment who betrays the team and is later replaced by Ariadne.[20]Talulah Rileyas a woman, credited as ""Blonde"", whom Eames disguises himself as in a dream. Riley liked the role, despite it being minimal: ""I get to wear a nice dress, pick up men in bars, and shove them in elevators. It was good to do something adultish. Usually I play 15-year-old English schoolgirls.""[21]Pete Postlethwaiteas Maurice Fischer, Robert Fischer's father and the dying founder of a business empire.Production[edit]Development[edit]Emma Thomas and Christopher Nolan answer questions aboutInception. The husband-and-wife team produced the film through their companySyncopy. Nolan also wrote and directed it.Initially, Christopher Nolan wrote an 80-pagetreatmentabout dream-stealers.[22]Nolan had originally envisionedInceptionas ahorror film,[22]but eventually wrote it as aheist filmeven though he found that ""traditionally [they] are very deliberately superficial in emotional terms.""[23]Upon revisiting his script, he decided that basing it in that genre did not work because the story ""relies so heavily on the idea of the interior state, the idea of dream andmemory. I realized I needed to raise the emotional stakes.""[23]Nolan worked on the script for nine to ten years.[6]When he first started thinking about making the film, Nolan was influenced by ""that era of movies where you hadThe Matrix(1999), you hadDark City(1998), you hadThe Thirteenth Floor(1999) and, to a certain extent, you hadMemento(2000), too. They were based in the principles that the world around you might not be real.""[23][24]Nolan first pitched the film to Warner Bros. in 2001, but decided that he needed more experience making large-scale films, and embarked onBatman BeginsandThe Dark Knight.[25]He soon realized that a film likeInceptionneeded a large budget because ""as soon as you're talking about dreams, the potential of the human mind is infinite. And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite. It has to feel like you could go anywhere by the end of the film. And it has to work on a massive scale.""[25]After makingThe Dark Knight, Nolan decided to makeInceptionand spent six months completing the script.[25]Nolan said that the key to completing the script was wondering what would happen if several people shared the same dream. ""Once you remove the privacy, you've created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact, with validity, with weight, with dramatic consequences.""[26]Nolan had been trying to work with Leonardo DiCaprio for years and met him several times, but was unable to recruit him for any of his films untilInception.[14]DiCaprio finally agreed because he was ""intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character's going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life.""[27]: 93–94He read the script and found it to be ""very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate some of the things that have been swirling around his head for the last eight years.""[25]DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay. Nolan took a long time re-writing the script in order ""to make sure that the emotional journey of his [DiCaprio's] character was the driving force of the movie.""[6]On February 11, 2009, it was announced thatWarner Bros.purchasedInception, aspec scriptwritten by Nolan.[28]Locations and sets[edit]Principal photographybegan inTokyoon June 19, 2009, with the scene in which Saito first hires Cobb during a helicopter flight over the city.[22][10]: 13The production moved to the United Kingdom and shot in a convertedairship hangarinCardington, Bedfordshire, north of London.[10]: 14There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built.[29]: 29A hotel corridor was also constructed byGuy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer,Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, andWally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360 degrees to create the effect of alternate directions ofgravityfor scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea was inspired by a technique used inStanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odyssey(1968). Nolan said, ""I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario"".[29]: 32The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40 feet (12 m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length was increased to 100 ft (30 m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors.[10]: 14Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like ""a gianthamster wheel"".[23]Nolan said of the device, ""It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way"".[23]Gordon-Levitt remembered, ""it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall.""[30]On July 15, 2009, filming took place atUniversity College Londonfor the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story,[22]including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.[31]Filming moved to France, where they shot Cobb entering the college of architecture (the place used for the entrance was theMusée Galliera) and the pivotal scenes between Ariadne and Cobb, in abistro(a fictional one set up at the corner of Rue César Franck and Rue Bouchut), and lastly on theBir-Hakeim bridge.[10]: 17For the explosion that takes place during the bistro scene, local authorities would not allow the use of real explosives. High-pressurenitrogenwas used to create the effect of a series of explosions. Pfister used six high-speed cameras to capture the sequence from different angles and make sure that they got the shot. The visual effects department enhanced the sequence, adding more destruction and flying debris. For the ""Paris folding"" sequence and when Ariadne ""creates"" the bridges,green screenandCGIwere used on location.[10]: 17Tangier, Morocco, doubled asMombasa, where Cobb hires Eames and Yusuf. A foot chase was shot in the streets and alleyways of the historicmedina quarter.[10]: 18To capture this sequence, Pfister employed a mix ofhand-held cameraandsteadicamwork.[10]: 19Tangier was also used as the setting for filming an important riot scene during the initial foray into Saito's mind.Filming moved to theLos Angelesarea, where some sets were built on a Warner Bros.sound stage, including the interior rooms of Saito's Japanese castle (the exterior was done on a small set built inMalibu Beach). The dining room was inspired by the historicNijō Castle, built around 1603. These sets were inspired by a mix ofJapanese architectureand Western influences.[10]: 19The production staged a multi-vehiclecar chaseon the streets ofdowntown Los Angeles, which involved a freight train crashing down the middle of a street.[10]: 20To do this, the filmmakers configured a train engine on the chassis of a tractor trailer. The replica was made fromfiberglassmolds taken from authentic train parts and matched in terms of color and design.[10]: 21Also, the car chase was supposed to be set in the midst of a downpour, but the L.A. weather stayed typically sunny. The filmmakers set up elaborate effects (e.g., rooftopwater cannons) to give the audience the impression that the weather was overcast and soggy. L.A. was also the site of the climactic scene where aFord Econolinevan runs off theSchuyler Heim Bridgein slow motion.[32]This sequence was filmed on and off for months, with the van being shot out of a cannon, according to actor Dileep Rao. Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film.Once the van landed in the water, the challenge for the actors was to avoid panic. ""And when they ask you to act, it's a bit of an ask,"" explained Cillian Murphy.[32]The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air fromscuba tanks; underwaterbuddy breathingis shown in this sequence.[32]Cobb's house was in Pasadena. The hotel lobby was filmed at the CAA building in Century City. ""Limbo"" was made on location in Los Angeles andMorocco, with the beach scene filmed atPalos Verdesbeach with CGI buildings. N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for ""Limbo"", with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.The final phase of principal photography took place inAlbertain late November 2009. The location manager discovered a temporarily closed ski resort,Fortress Mountain.[10]: 22An elaborate set was assembled near the top station of the Canadianchairlift, taking three months to build.[27]: 93The production had to wait for a huge snowstorm, which eventually arrived.[22]The ski-chase sequence was inspired by Nolan's favoriteJames Bondfilm,On Her Majesty's Secret Service(1969): ""What I liked about it that we've tried to emulate in this film is there's a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion.""[27]: 91Cinematography[edit]The film was shot primarily in theanamorphic formaton35 mm film, with key sequences filmed on65 mm, and aerial sequences inVistaVision. Nolan did not shoot any footage withIMAXcameras as he had withThe Dark Knight. ""We didn't feel that we were going to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film, given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible. Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras, even though I love the format dearly"".[6]In addition Nolan and Pfister tested usingShowscanandSuper Dimension 70as potential large-format,high-frame-ratecamera systems to use for the film, but ultimately decided against either format.[29]: 29Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo-Sonics 35 mm camera at speeds of up to 1,000 frames per second. Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speeddigital camera, but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches. ""Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one usable piece and it didn't end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35 mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie.""[33]Nolan also chose not to shoot any of the film in3Das he prefers shooting on film[6]usingprime lenses, which is not possible with 3D cameras.[34]Nolan has also criticized the dim image that 3D projection produces, and disputes that traditional film does not allow realisticdepth perception, saying ""I think it's a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D. The whole point of cinematic imagery is it's three dimensional... You know 95% of ourdepth cuescome fromocclusion, resolution, color and so forth, so the idea of calling a 2D movie a '2D movie' is a little misleading.""[35]Nolan did testconvertingInceptioninto 3D in post-production but decided that, while it was possible, he lacked the time to complete the conversion to a standard he was happy with.[22][35]In February 2011Jonathan Liebesmansuggested that Warner Bros. were attempting a 3D conversion forBlu-rayrelease.[36]Wally Pfister gave each location and dream level a distinctive look to aid the audience's recognition of the narrative's location during the heavily crosscut portion of the film: the mountain fortress appears sterile and cool, the hotel hallways have warm hues, and the scenes in the van are more neutral.[29]: 35–36Nolan has said that the film ""deals with levels of reality, and perceptions of reality which is something I'm very interested in. It's an action film set in a contemporary world, but with a slight science-fiction bent to it"", while also describing it as ""very much an ensemble film structured somewhat as a heist movie. It's an action adventure that spans the globe"".[37]Visual effects[edit]For dream sequences inInception, Nolan used littlecomputer-generated imagery, preferringpractical effectswhenever possible. Nolan said, ""It's always very important to me to do as much as possible in-camera, and then, if necessary, computer graphics are very useful to build on or enhance what you have achieved physically.""[10]: 12To this end, visual effects supervisorPaul Franklinbuilt aminiatureof the mountain fortress set and then blew it up for the film. For the fight scene that takes place in zero gravity, he used CG-based effects to ""subtly bend elements like physics, space and time.""[38]The most challenging effect was the ""Limbo"" city level at the end of the film, because it continually developed during production. Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan expressed his ideal vision: ""Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture, but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs"".[38]Franklin and his team ended up with ""something that looked like an iceberg version ofGotham Citywith water running through it.""[38]They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct DiCaprio and Page based on this rough computer animation that Franklin had created.Inceptionhad nearly 500 visual effects shots (in comparison,Batman Beginshad approximately 620), which is relatively few in comparison to contemporary effects-heavy films, which can have as many as 2,000 visual effects shots.[38]Music[edit]Main article:Inception: Music from the Motion PictureThe score forInceptionwas written byHans Zimmer,[18]who described his work as ""a very electronic,[39]dense score"",[40]filled with ""nostalgia and sadness"" to match Cobb's feelings throughout the film.[41]The music was written simultaneously to filming,[40]and features a guitar sound reminiscent ofEnnio Morricone, played byJohnny Marr, former guitarist ofthe Smiths.Édith Piaf's ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" (""No, I Regret Nothing"") appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score.[41]Asoundtrack albumwas released on July 11, 2010, byReprise Records.[42]The majority of the score was also included in high resolution5.1 surround soundon the second disc of the two-disc Blu-ray release.[43]Hans Zimmer's music was nominated for an Academy Award in theBest Original Scorecategory in 2011, losing toTrent ReznorandAtticus RossofThe Social Network.[44]Themes[edit]Reality and dreams[edit]Penrose stairsare incorporated into the film as an example of theimpossible objectsthat can be created inlucid dreamworlds.InInception, Nolan wanted to explore ""the idea of people sharing a dream space... That gives you the ability to access somebody'sunconscious mind. What would that be used and abused for?""[6]The majority of the film's plot takes place in these interconnected dream worlds. This structure creates a framework where actions in the real or dream worlds ripple across others. The dream is always in a state of production, and shifts across the levels as the characters navigate it.[45]By contrast, the world ofThe Matrix(1999) is an authoritarian, computer-controlled one, alluding to theories of social control developed by thinkersMichel FoucaultandJean Baudrillard. However, according to one interpretation Nolan's world has more in common with the works ofGilles DeleuzeandFélix Guattari.[45]David DenbyinThe New Yorkercompared Nolan's cinematic treatment of dreams toLuis Buñuel's inBelle de Jour(1967) andThe Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie(1972).[46]He criticized Nolan's ""literal-minded"" action level sequencing compared to Buñuel, who ""silently pushed us into reveries and left us alone to enjoy our wonderment, but Nolan is working on so many levels of representation at once that he has to lay in pages of dialogue just to explain what's going on."" The latter captures ""the peculiar malign intensity of actual dreams.""[46]Deirdre Barrett, a dream researcher atHarvard University, said that Nolan did not get every detail accurate regarding dreams, but their illogical, rambling, disjointed plots would not make for a great thriller anyway. However, ""he did get many aspects right,"" she said, citing the scene in which a sleeping Cobb is shoved into a full bath, and in the dream world water gushes into the windows of the building, waking him up. ""That's very much how real stimuli get incorporated, and you very often wake up right after that intrusion.""[47]Nolan himself said, ""I tried to work that idea of manipulation and management of aconscious dreambeing a skill that these people have. Really the script is based on those common, very basic experiences and concepts, and where can those take you? And the only outlandish idea that the film presents, really, is the existence of a technology that allows you to enter and share the same dream as someone else.""[23]Dreams and cinema[edit]Others have argued that the film is itself ametaphor for filmmaking, and that the filmgoing experience itself, images flashing before one's eyes in a darkened room, is akin to a dream. Writing inWired, Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film-watching and sleeping. In both, thevisual cortexis highly active and theprefrontal cortex, which deals with logic, deliberate analysis, and self-awareness, is quiet.[48]Paul argued that the experience of going to a picturehouse is itself an exercise in shared dreaming, particularly when viewingInception: the film's sharp cutting between scenes forces the viewer to create larger narrative arcs to stitch the pieces together. This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, on the part of the audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious.[45]At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by addingfacing mirrorsunderneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus inla Croixasked ""Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?""[49]Cinematic technique[edit]See also:Cinematic style of Christopher NolanGenre[edit]Nolan combined elements from several different film genres into the film, notably science fiction,heist film, andfilm noir.Marion Cotillardplays ""Mal"" Cobb, Dom Cobb's projection of his guilt over his deceased wife's suicide. As the film's main antagonist, she is a frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor.[14]Nolan described Mal as ""the essence of the femme fatale"",[10]: 9the keynoirreference in the film. As a ""classic femme fatale"" her relationship with Cobb is in his mind, a manifestation of Cobb's own neurosis and fear of how little he knows about the woman he loves.[50]DiCaprio praised Cotillard's performance saying that ""she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character"".[10]: 10Nolan began with the structure of a heist movie, sinceexpositionis an essential element of that genre, though adapted it to have a greater emotional narrative suited to the world of dreams and subconscious.[50]As Denby described this device: ""the outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper"".[46]Kristin Thompsonargued that exposition was a major formal device in the film. While a traditional heist movie has a heavy dose of exposition at the beginning as the team assembles and the leader explains the plan, inInceptionthis becomes nearly continuous as the group progresses through the various levels of dreaming.[51]Three quarters of the film, until the van begins to fall from the bridge, are devoted to explaining its plot. In this way, exposition takes precedence over characterization. The characters' relationships are created by their respective skills and roles. Ariadne, likeher ancient namesake, creates the maze and guides the others through it, but also helps Cobb navigate his own subconscious, and as the sole student of dream sharing, helps the audience understand the concept of the plot.[52]Nolan drew inspiration from the works ofJorge Luis Borges,[22][53]including ""The Secret Miracle"" and ""The Circular Ruins"",[54]and from the filmsBlade Runner(1982) andThe Matrix(1999).[54][55]While Nolan has not confirmed this, it has also been suggested by many observers that the movie draws heavy inspiration from the 2006 animated filmPaprika.[56][57][58]Ending[edit]The film cuts to theclosing creditsfrom a shot of the top apparently starting to show an ever so faint wobble, inviting speculation about whether the final sequence was reality or another dream. Nolan confirmed that the ambiguity was deliberate,[50]saying, ""I've been asked the question more times than I've ever been asked any other question about any other film I've made... What's funny to me is that people really do expect me to answer it.""[59]The film's script concludes with ""Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING. And we—FADE OUT"".[60]Nolan said, ""I put that cut there at the end, imposing an ambiguity from outside the film. That always felt the right ending to me—it always felt like the appropriate 'kick' to me... The real point of the scene—and this is what I tell people—is that Cobb isn't looking at the top. He's looking at his kids. He's left it behind. That's the emotional significance of the thing.""[59]Caine interpreted the ending as meaning that Cobb is in the real world, quoting Nolan as telling him ""'Well, when you're in the scene, it's reality.' So get that — if I'm in it, it's reality. If I'm not in it, it's a dream"". While reiterating that he was uncomfortable with definitively explaining the scene, Nolan in 2023 creditedEmma Thomasas providing ""the correct answer, which is Leo's character ... doesn't care at that point"".[61]Mark Fisherargued that ""a century of cultural theory"" cautions against accepting theauthor's interpretationas anything more than a supplementary text, and this all the more so given the theme of the instability of any one master position in Nolan's films. Therein the manipulator is often the one who ends up manipulated, and Cobb's ""not caring"" about whether or not his world is real may be the price of his happiness and release.[62]Release[edit]Marketing[edit]Warner Bros. spent US$100 million marketing the film. AlthoughInceptionwas not part of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of ""Christopher Nolan as a brand"". Kroll declared that ""We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day.""[63]The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy—as reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, ""You have this movie which is going to have a pretty big built in fanbase... but you also have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [Nolan] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that—at least early on—is with an eye to feeding the interest to fans.""[64]Aviral marketingcampaign was employed for the film. After the revelation of the first teaser trailer, in August 2009, the film's official website featured only an animation of Cobb's spinning top. In December, the top toppled over and the website opened the online gameMind Crime, which upon completion revealedInception's poster.[65]The rest of the campaign unrolled afterWonderConin April 2010, where Warner gave away promotional T-shirts featuring the PASIV briefcase used to create the dream space, and had aQR codelinking to an online manual of the device.[66]Mind Crimealso received a stage 2 with more resources, including a hidden trailer for the movie.[67]More pieces of viral marketing began to surface beforeInception's release, such as a manual filled with bizarre images and text sent toWiredmagazine,[68]and the online publication of posters, ads, phone applications, and strange websites all related to the film.[69][70]Warner also released an online prequel comic,Inception: The Cobol Job.[71]The official trailer released on May 10, 2010, throughMind Gamewas extremely well received.[67]It featured an original piece of music, ""Mind Heist"", by recording artistZack Hemsey,[72]rather than music from the score.[73]The trailer quickly went viral with numerousmashupscopying its style, both by amateurs on sites like YouTube[74]and by professionals on sites such asCollegeHumor.[75][76]On June 7, 2010, a behind-the-scenes featurette on the film was released in HD on Yahoo! Movies.[77]Inceptionand its film trailers are widely credited for launching the trend throughout the 2010s in which blockbuster movie trailers repeatedly hit audiences with so-called ""braam"" sounds: ""bassy, brassy, thunderous notes—like a foghorn on steroids—meant to impart a sense of apocalyptic momentousness"".[78]However, different composers worked on the teaser trailer, first trailer, second trailer, and film score, meaning that identifying the composer(s) responsible for that trend is a complicated task.[78]Home media[edit]Inceptionwas released onDVDandBlu-rayon December 3, 2010, in France,[79]and the week after in the United Kingdom and United States (December 7, 2010).[80][81]The film was released onVHSinSouth Korea, making it one of the last major studio films released for the format.[82]Warner Bros. also made available in the United States a limited Blu-ray edition packaged in a metal replica of the PASIV briefcase, which included extras such as a metal replica of the spinning top totem. With a production run of less than 2,000, it sold out in one weekend.[83]Inceptionwas released on4K Blu-rayanddigital copyalong with other Christopher Nolan films on December 19, 2017.[84]As of 2018[update], thehome videoreleases have sold over 9million units and grossed over$160 million.[85]Putative video game[edit]In a November 2010 interview, Nolan expressed his intention to develop a video game set in theInceptionworld, working with a team of collaborators. He described it as ""a longer-term proposition"", referring to the medium of video games as ""something I've wanted to explore"".[86]10th anniversary re-release[edit]Inceptionwas re-released in theaters for its tenth anniversary, starting on August 12, 2020, in international markets and on August 21 in the U.S.[87]The re-release was originally announced by Warner Bros. in June 2020 and scheduled for July 17, 2020, taking the original release date for Nolan's upcoming filmTenetafter its delay to July 31 due to the impact of theCOVID-19 pandemicon movie theaters.[88]AfterTenetwas delayed again to August 12, the re-release was shifted to July 31,[89]before setting on the August release date following a third delay.[87]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]FilmRelease dateBox office revenueBox office rankingBudgetReferenceUnited StatesNorth AmericaInternationalWorldwideAll-time domesticAll-time worldwideInceptionJuly 2010US$292,587,330US$578,205,319US$839,030,630No. 109No. 80US$160,000,000[90]Inceptionwas released in both conventional andIMAXtheaters on July 16, 2010.[91][92]The film had its world premiere atLeicester Squarein London on July 8, 2010.[93]In the United States and Canada,Inceptionwas released theatrically in 3,792 conventional theaters and 195 IMAX theaters.[91]The film grossed US$21.8 million during its opening day on July 16, 2010, with midnight screenings in 1,500 locations.[94]Overall the film made US$62.7 million and debuted at No.1 on its opening weekend.[95]Inception's opening weekend gross made it the second-highest-grossing debut for ascience fiction filmthat was not a sequel, remake or adaptation, behindAvatar's US$77 million opening-weekend gross in 2009.[95]The film held the top spot of the box office rankings in its second and third weekends, with drops of just 32% (US$42.7 million) and 36% (US$27.5 million), respectively,[96][97]before dropping to second place in its fourth week, behindThe Other Guys.[98]Inceptioninitially grossed US$292 million in the United States and Canada, US$56 million in the United Kingdom, Ireland andMaltaand US$479 million in other countries for a total of US$828 million worldwide.[3]Its five highest-grossing markets after the US and Canada (US$292 million) were China (US$68 million), the United Kingdom, Ireland andMalta(US$56 million), France and theMaghrebregion (US$43 million), Japan (US$40 million) andSouth Korea(US$38 million).[99]It was thesixth-highest-grossing film of 2010 in North America,[100]and thefourth-highest-grossing film of 2010, behindToy Story 3,Alice in WonderlandandHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1.[101]Its subsequent re-releases increased its gross to US$839 million.[3]Inceptionis the fourth most lucrative production in Christopher Nolan's career—behindThe Dark Knight,The Dark Knight RisesandOppenheimer[102]—and the second most forLeonardo DiCaprio—behindTitanic.[103]Critical response[edit]OnRotten Tomatoes,Inceptionholds an approval rating of 87% based on 368 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads: ""Smart, innovative, and thrilling,Inceptionis that rare summer blockbuster that succeeds viscerally as well as intellectually.""[104]Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating ""generally favorable"" reviews.[105]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.[106]Peter TraversofRolling StonecalledInceptiona ""wildly ingenious chess game,"" and concluded ""the result is a knockout.""[107]Justin Chang ofVarietypraised the film as ""a conceptualtour de force"" and wrote, ""applying a vivid sense of procedural detail to a fiendishly intricate yarn set in thelabyrinthof theunconscious mind, the writer-director has devised a heist thriller forsurrealists, aJungian'sRififi, that challenges viewers to sift through multiple layers of (un)reality.""[108]Jim Vejvoda ofIGNrated the film as perfect, deeming it ""a singular accomplishment from a filmmaker who has only gotten better with each film.""[109]Relevant's David Roark called it Nolan's ""greatest accomplishment"", saying, ""Visually, intellectually and emotionally,Inceptionis a masterpiece.""[110]In its August 2010 issue,Empiregave the film a full five stars and wrote, ""it feels likeStanley Kubrickadapting the work of the great sci-fi authorWilliam Gibson[...] Nolan delivers another true original: welcome to an undiscovered country.""[111]Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film a B+ grade and wrote, ""It's a rolling explosion of images as hypnotizing and sharply angled as any in a drawing byM.

WithInception, viewers have a chance to see that notion get a state-of-the-art update.""[117]Kenneth Turanof theLos Angeles Timesfelt that Nolan was able to blend ""the best of traditional and modern filmmaking. If you're searching for smart and nervy popular entertainment, this is what it looks like.""[118]USA Today'sClaudia Puig gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars and felt that Nolan ""regards his viewers as possibly smarter than they are—or at least as capable of rising to his inventive level. That's a tall order. But it's refreshing to find a director who makes us stretch, even occasionally struggle, to keep up.""[119]Not all reviewers gave the film positive reviews.New Yorkmagazine'sDavid Edelsteinsaid in his review that he had ""no idea what so many people are raving about. It's as if someone went into their heads while they were sleeping and planted the idea thatInceptionis a visionary masterpiece and—hold on ... Whoa! I think I get it. The movie is a metaphor for the power of delusional hype—a metaphor for itself.""[120]The New York Observer'sRex Reedsaid the film's development was ""pretty much what we've come to expect from summer movies in general and Christopher Nolan movies in particular ... [it] doesn't seem like much of an accomplishment to me.""[121]A. O. ScottofThe New York Timescommented ""there is a lot to see inInception, there is nothing that counts as genuine vision. Mr. Nolan's idea of the mind is too literal, too logical, and too rule-bound to allow the full measure of madness.""[122]The New Yorker'sDavid Denbyconsidered the film to be ""not nearly as much fun as Nolan imagined it to be"", concluding that ""Inceptionis a stunning-looking film that gets lost in fabulous intricacies, a movie devoted to its own workings and to little else.""[46]While some critics have tended to view the film as perfectly straightforward, and even criticize its overarching themes as ""the stuff of torpid platitudes"", online discussion has been much more positive.[123]Heated debate has centered on the ambiguity of the ending, with many critics like Devin Faraci making the case that the film is self-referential and tongue-in-cheek, both a film about film-making and a dream about dreams.[124]Other critics readInceptionas Christian allegory and focus on the film's use of religious and water symbolism.[125]Yet other critics, such asKristin Thompson, see less value in the ambiguous ending of the film and more in its structure and novel method of storytelling, highlightingInceptionas a new form of narrative that revels in ""continuous exposition"".[51]Several critics and scholars have noted the film has many striking similarities to the 2006animefilmPaprikabySatoshi Kon(andYasutaka Tsutsui's 1993novel of the same name), including plot similarities, similar scenes, and similar characters, arguing thatInceptionwas influenced byPaprika.[56][57][58][126][127]Several sources have also noted plot similarities between the film and the 2002Uncle ScroogecomicThe Dream of a LifetimebyDon Rosa.[128][129][130]The influence of Tarkovsky'sSolarisonInceptionwas noted as well.[131][132]Year-end and all-time lists[edit]Inceptionappeared on over 273 critics' lists of the top ten films of 2010, being picked as number-one on at least 55 of those lists.[133]It was the second-most-mentioned film in both the top ten lists and number-one rankings, only behindThe Social Networkalong withToy Story 3,True Grit,The King's Speech, andBlack Swanas the most critically acclaimed films of 2010.[133]AuthorStephen KingplacedInceptionat No. 3 in his list of top 10 best films of the year.[134]FilmmakerDenis Villeneuvecited it as among his favorite films of all time.[135]In 2025, the film ranked number 55 onThe New York Times'list of ""The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century.""[5]Critics and publications who ranked the film first for that year includedRichard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Times,Kenneth Turanof theLos Angeles Times(tied withThe Social NetworkandToy Story 3), Tasha Robinson ofThe A.V. Club,Empiremagazine, and Kirk Honeycutt ofThe Hollywood Reporter.[136]Top ten lists[edit]Inceptionwas listed on many critics' lists of top ten movies for 2010.[137]1st –Richard Roeper,Chicago Sun-Times1st –Kenneth Turan,Los Angeles Times(tied withThe Social NetworkandToy Story 3)1st – Tasha Robinson,The A.V.

He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a youngElvis Presley, who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends.Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. While fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces break off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive afootballscholarshipat theUniversity of Alabamain 1963, where he is coached byBear Bryant, and witnessesGovernorGeorge Wallace'sStand in the Schoolhouse Door, during which he returns a dropped book toVivian Malone Jones. Forrest becomes a topkick returner, is named to theAll-American team, and meets PresidentJohn F. Kennedyat theWhite House.After graduating college in 1966, Forrest enlists in theU.S. Army.

In 1967, they are sent toVietnam, serving with the9th Infantry Divisionin theMekong Deltaregion. After months of routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves several wounded platoon mates – including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs. Gump is awarded theMedal of Honorfor his heroism by PresidentLyndon B. Johnson.At theanti-warMarch on the Pentagonrally, Forrest meetsAbbie Hoffmanand briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living ahippielifestyle.

Jenny eventually becomes a waitress in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives in an apartment with her (and Forrest's) son, Forrest Jr. They eventually get married, but soon afterward she dies from complications due to an unnamed disease. This unknown disease was intended by Winston Groom, the author of the original novel, to beHepatitis C, itself an ""unknown virus"" until defined in April 1989,[7][8]although some of the makers of the film have said that they intended for the unknown disease to have beenHIV/AIDS.[9][10][11]Hanna R. Hallas young Jenny Curran.Gary SiniseasLieutenantDan Taylor: Forrest and Bubba Blue's platoon leader during the Vietnam War, whose ancestors have died in every U.S. war and who regards it as his destiny to do the same.

Throughout filming, Williamson wore a lip attachment to create Bubba's protruding lip.[12]Sally Fieldas Mrs. Gump: Forrest's mother. Field reflected on the character, ""She's a woman who loves her son unconditionally. ... A lot of her dialogue sounds like slogans, and that's just what she intends.""[13]Haley Joel Osmentas Forrest Gump Jr.: Osment was cast in the film after the casting director noticed him in a 1993Pizza Hutcommercial. It was his debut feature film role.[14][15]Peter DobsonasElvis Presley: AlthoughKurt Russellwas uncredited, he provided the voice for Elvis in the scene.[16]Dick Cavettas himself: Cavett played ade-agedversion of himself in the 1970s, withmakeupapplied to make him appear younger.

We flipped the two elements of the book, making the love story primary and the fantastic adventures secondary. Also, the book was cynical and colder than the movie. In the movie, Gump is a completely decent character, always true to his word. He has no agenda and no opinion about anything except Jenny, his mother and God.""—directorRobert Zemeckis[20]The film is based on the 1986novelbyWinston Groom. Both center on the character of Forrest Gump. However, the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel before skipping ahead to the end of the novel, with the founding of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and the meeting with Forrest Jr. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump's life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States.[21]Gump's core character and personality are also changed from the novel; among other things, his film character is less of asavant– in the novel, while playing football at the university, he fails craft and gym but receives a perfect score in an advanced physics class he is enrolled in by his coach to satisfy his college requirements.[21]The novel also features Gump as anastronaut, aprofessional wrestler, and achessplayer.[21]The book had a bidding war regarding an adaptation even before publication, withWendy FinermanandSteve Tischacquiring them by joining forces withWarner Bros., where Finerman's husbandMark Cantonwas president of production.[22]Groom was paid $500,000 and also wrote the first three first drafts of the screenplay, which leaned closer to the events of the novel.[23]AfterRain Mantold the story of a savant, Warner Bros. lost interest in the picture, and by 1990 the project was inturnaround. Finerman contactedColumbia Pictures, who went on to reject it,[24]while hiringEric Rothto rewrite the script. Roth and Finerman kept in contact with Groom to ensure the script was historically accurate.[23]Roth delivered a screenplay in 1992, whichParamount PictureschairwomanSherry Lansingliked enough to bring the project to her studio, who acquired the rights from Warner Bros. in exchange for the script forExecutive Decision.[25][26]Ivan Reitman,Penny MarshallandTerry Gilliampassed on the project beforeRobert Zemeckiswas hired.[27][28][26]Barry Sonnenfeldwas attached to the film, but left to directAddams Family Values.[29]Casting[edit]John Travoltawas the original choice to play the title role and later said that passing on the role was a mistake.[30][31][32]Bill Murray,Chevy Chase, andMatthew Broderickwere also considered for the role.[33]Sean Pennhad stated in an interview that he had been second choice for the role; he would later portray a character with a disability in the 2001 filmI Am Sam. Hanks revealed that he signed on to the film after an hour and a half of reading the script.[34]He initially wanted to ease Forrest's pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by directorRobert Zemeckisto portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel.[34]Hanks also said it took him three days producing unusable footage in order to learn how to play the role.[35]Winston Groom, who wrote the original novel, describes the film as having taken the ""rough edges"" off the character whom he had envisioned being played byJohn Goodman.[36]Additionally, Tom's younger brotherJim Hanksis his acting double in the movie for the scenes whenever Forrest was running.[37]Tom's daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as the girl on the school bus who refuses to let young Forrest sit next to her.[38]Sally Field agreed to take on the role of Mrs. Gump after reading the script.[39]Joe PesciandKevin Baconwere considered for the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, which was eventually given toGary Sinise.[40][41]Sinise drew inspiration from the struggles thatVietnam Warveterans, some on his wife's side of his family, were going through when returning from serving in Vietnam.[42]David Alan Grier,Ice CubeandDave Chappellewere offered the role of Benjamin Buford Blue, but all three turned it down.[43][44]Chappelle, who said he believed the film would be unsuccessful, has been reported as saying that he regrets not taking the role. Hanks was aware of Chappelle's disappointment in missing out on the part and agreed to work with him in a future movie, which ended up beingYou've Got Mail.[43]RapperTupac Shakuralso auditioned.[45]Filming[edit]The shrimping boat Gump used in the filmFilming began in August 1993 and ended in December of that year.[46]Although most of the film is set in Alabama, filming took place mainly in and aroundBeaufort, South Carolina, as well as parts of coastal Virginia and North Carolina,[34]including a running shot on theBlue Ridge ParkwaynearGrandfather Mountainwhere a part of the road subsequently became known as ""Forrest Gump Curve"".[47][48]Downtown portions of the fictional town of Greenbow were filmed inVarnville, South Carolina.[49]The studio was about to pull the plug on the film, until Zemeckis and Hanks cut the running sequence in the middle. Hanks used his own money for the sequence.[50]The scene of Forrest running through Vietnam while under fire was filmed onHunting Island State ParkandFripp Island, South Carolina.[51]Additional filming took place on theBiltmore EstateinAsheville, North Carolina.The location alongU.S. Route 163inMonument Valleywhere Forrest ends his runThe Gump family home set was built along theCombahee RivernearYemassee, South Carolina, and the nearby land was used to film Curran's home as well as some of the Vietnam scenes.[52]Over 20palmettotrees were planted to improve the Vietnam scenes.[52]Forrest Gump narrated his life's story at the northern edge ofChippewa SquareinSavannah, Georgia, as he sat at a bus stop bench. There were other scenes filmed in and around the Savannah area as well, including a running shot on theRichard V. Woods Memorial Bridgein Beaufort while he was being interviewed by the press, and on West Bay Street in Savannah.[52]Most of the college campus scenes were filmed inLos Angelesat theUniversity of Southern California. The lighthouse that Forrest runs across to reach the Atlantic Ocean the first time is theMarshall Point LighthouseinPort Clyde, Maine. Additional scenes were filmed in Arizona, Utah'sMonument Valley, and Montana'sGlacier National Park.[53]Visual effects[edit]Gump with President Kennedy. A variety of visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archive footage with various historical figures and events.Ken Ralstonand his team atIndustrial Light & Magicwere responsible for the film's visual effects. UsingCGItechniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against ablue screenalong with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage.[54]To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alterlip-syncingfor the new dialogue.[20]Archival footage was used and with the help of such techniques aschroma key,image warping,morphing, androtoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.In one Vietnam War scene, Gump carries Bubba away from an incomingnapalmattack. To create the effect,stunt actorswere initially used forcompositingpurposes. Then, Hanks and Williamson were filmed, with Williamson supported by a cable wire as Hanks ran with him. The explosion was then filmed, and the actors were digitally added to appear just in front of the explosions. The jet fighters and napalm canisters were also added by CGI.[55]The CGI removal of actorGary Sinise's legs, after his character had them amputated, was achieved by wrapping his legs with a blue fabric, which later facilitated the work of the ""roto-paint"" team to paint out his legs from every single frame. At one point, while hoisting himself into hiswheelchair, his legs are used for support.[56]The scene where Forrest spots Jenny at apeace rallyat theLincoln MemorialandReflecting Poolin Washington, D.C., required visual effects to create the large crowd of people. Over two days of filming, approximately 1,500extraswere used.[57]At each successive take, the extras were rearranged and moved into a differentquadrantaway from the camera. With the help of computers, the extras were multiplied to create a crowd of several hundred thousand people.[34][57]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]Produced on a budget of $55 million,Forrest Gumpopened in 1,332 theaters in the United States and Canada on Wednesday, July 6, 1994, and grossed more than $8 million in its first two days before expanding on Friday to 1,595 theaters and grossing $24,450,602 in its opening weekend, Paramount's biggest opening non-holiday weekend gross, surpassing the record set byThe Addams Family.[58]Motion picture business consultant and screenwriter Jeffrey Hilton suggested to producerWendy Finermanto double the P&A (film marketing budget) based on his viewing of an early print of the film. The budget was immediately increased, in line with his advice. In its opening weekend, the film placedfirst at the US box office, narrowly beatingThe Lion King, which was in its fourth week of release.[59]For the first twelve weeks of release, the film was in the top 3 at the US box office, topping the list 5 times, including in its tenth week of release, when it surpassedRaiders of the Lost Arkas Paramount's highest grossing film in the United States and Canada.[60][61]Paramount removed the film from release in the United States when its gross hit $300 million in January 1995, and it was the second-highest-grossing film of the year, behindThe Lion Kingwith $305 million.[62][63]The film was reissued on February 17, 1995, after theAcademy Awardsnominations were announced.[64]After the reissue in 1,100 theaters, the film grossed an additional $29 million in the United States and Canada, bringing its total to $329.7 million, making it the third-highest-grossing film at that time behind onlyE.T. the Extra-TerrestrialandJurassic Park.[60][65][66]Box Office Mojoestimates that the film sold over 78.5 million tickets in the US and Canada in its initial theatrical run.[67]The film was the fastest grossing Paramount film to pass $100 million (18 days), $200 million (46 days; fourth fastest in history), and $300 million (193 days) in box office receipts (at the time of its release).[68][69][70][71]After reissues, the film has gross receipts of $330,252,182 in the U.S. and Canada and $347,693,217 in international markets for a total of $677,945,399 worldwide. Ultimately, it finished as the fourth highest grossingfilm of the 1990sin the United States and Canada.[72]Even with such revenue, the film was known as a ""successful failure""; due to distributors' and exhibitors' high fees, Paramount's ""losses"" clocked in at $62 million, leaving executives realizing the necessity of better deals.[73]This has also been associated withHollywood accounting, where expenses are inflated to minimize profit sharing.[74]Forrest Gumpheld the record for being the highest-grossing Paramount film until it was overtaken byTitanicthree years later in 1997. However, it remained the highest-grossing film solely distributed by Paramount until it was surpassed byShrek the Third13 years later in 2007.[75]For 12 years, it remained as the highest-grossing film starring Tom Hanks; it was surpassed in 2006 byThe Da Vinci Code.[76]Critical reception[edit]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 75% of 158 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.80/10. The website's consensus reads: ""Tom Hanks' rigorously earnest performance keepsForrest Gumpsincere even when it gets glib with American history, making for a whimsical odyssey of debatable wisdom but undeniable heart.""[77]At the websiteMetacritic, the film earned a rating of 82 out of 100 based on 21 reviews by mainstream critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[78]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare ""A+"" grade.[79]The story was commended by several critics.Roger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timeswrote, ""I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like 'Forrest Gump.' Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay byEric Rothhas the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie.""[80]Todd McCarthy ofVarietywrote that the film ""has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop.""[81]In contrast,Anthony LaneofThe New Yorkercalled the film ""Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell.""[82]Owen GleibermanofEntertainment Weeklysaid that the film was ""glib, shallow, and monotonous"" and ""reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version ofDisney's America.""[83]Gump garnered comparisons to fictional characterHuckleberry Finn, as well as U.S. politiciansRonald Reagan,Pat BuchananandBill Clinton.[84][85][86][87]Peter Chomo writes that Gump acts as a ""social mediator and as an agent of redemption in divided times"".[88]Peter TraversofRolling Stonecalled Gump ""everything we admire in the American character – honest, brave, and loyal with a heart of gold.""[89]The New York Timesreviewer Janet Maslin called Gump a ""hollow man"" who is ""self-congratulatory in his blissful ignorance, warmly embraced as the embodiment of absolutely nothing.""[90]Marc Vincenti ofPalo Alto Weeklycalled the character ""a pitiful stooge taking the pie of life in the face, thoughtfully licking his fingers.""[91]Bruce Kawin andGerald Mast's textbook on film history notes that Forrest Gump's dimness was a metaphor for glamorized nostalgia in that he represented a blank slate onto which theBaby Boomer generationprojected their memories of those events.[92]Re-evaluation[edit]Writing in 2004,Entertainment Weeklysaid, ""Nearly a decade after it earned gazillions and swept the Oscars, Robert Zemeckis' ode to 20th-century America still represents one of cinema's most clearly drawn lines in the sand. One half of folks see it as an artificial piece of pop melodrama, while everyone else raves that it's sweet as a box of chocolates.""[93]In 2015,The Hollywood Reporterpolled hundreds of academy members, asking them to re-vote on past controversial decisions. Academy members said that, given a second chance, they would award the 1994 Oscar forBest PicturetoThe Shawshank Redemptioninstead.[94]Author payment controversy[edit]Winston Groomwas paid $350,000 for the screenplay rights to his novelForrest Gumpand was contracted for a 3 percent share of the film'snetprofits.[95]However, Paramount and the film's producers did not pay him the percentage, usingHollywood accountingto posit that the blockbuster film lost money. Tom Hanks, by contrast, contracted for a percent share of the film'sgrossreceipts instead of a salary, and he and director Zemeckis each received $40 million.[95][96]In addition, Groom was not mentioned once in any of the film's six Oscar-winner speeches.[97]Groom's dispute with Paramount was later effectively resolved after Groom declared he was satisfied with Paramount's explanation of their accounting, this coinciding with Groom receiving a seven-figure contract with Paramount for film rights to another of his books,Gump & Co.[98]This film was never made, remaining indevelopment hellfor at least a dozen years.[99]Home video[edit]Forrest Gumpwas first released onVHSon April 27, 1995, and onLaserdiscthe following day. The laserdisc wasTHXcertified and released without chapters, requiring the film be watched start to finish. Film magazines of the period stated this was at the request of Zemeckis who wanted viewers to enjoy the film in its entirety. It became the best-selling adult sell-through video, with sales of over 12 million.[100]A widescreen VHS release debuted a year later on September 10, 1996.[101]It was released in a two-discDVDset on August 28, 2001.[102]Special features included director and producer commentaries, production featurettes, and screen tests.[103]The film was released onBlu-rayin November 2009.[104]Paramount released the film onUltra HD Blu-rayin June 2018.[105]On May 7, 2019, Paramount Pictures released a newly remastered two-disc Blu-ray that contains bonus content.[106]Accolades[edit]Main article:List of accolades received byForrest GumpForrest GumpwonBest Picture,Best Actor in a Leading Role(Hanks had won the previous year forPhiladelphia),Best Director,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay, andBest Film Editingat the67th Academy Awards.[107]The film was nominated for sevenGolden Globe Awards, winning three of them:Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama,Best Director – Motion Picture, andBest Motion Picture – Drama. The film was also nominated for sixSaturn Awardsand won two forBest Fantasy FilmandBest Supporting Actor (Film).In addition to the film's multiple awards and nominations, it has also been recognized by theAmerican Film Instituteon several of its lists. The film ranks 37th on100 Years...100 Cheers, 71st on100 Years...100 Movies, and 76th on100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition). In addition, the quote ""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get,"" was ranked 40th on100 Years...100 Movie Quotes.[108]The film also ranked at number 61 onEmpire's list of the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time.[109]In December 2011,Forrest Gumpwas selected for preservation in theLibrary of Congress'National Film Registry.[110]The Registry said that the film was ""honored for its technological innovations (the digital insertion of Gump seamlessly into vintage archivalfootage), its resonance within the culture that has elevated Gump (and what he represents in terms of American innocence) to the status of folk hero, and its attempt to engage both playfully and seriously with contentious aspects of the era's traumatic history.""[111]American Film InstitutelistsAFI's 100 Years...100 Movies– #71AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:""Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" – #40AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers– #37AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)– #76Symbolism[edit]Feather[edit]""I don't want to sound like a bad version of 'the child within'. But the childlike innocence of Forrest Gump is what we all once had. It's an emotional journey. You laugh and cry. It does what movies are supposed to do: make you feel alive.""—producerWendy Finerman[86]Various interpretations have been suggested for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall ofThe New York Timesnoted several suggestions made about the feather: ""Does the white feather symbolizeThe Unbearable Lightness of Being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?""[112]Hanks interpreted the feather as: ""Our destiny is only defined by how we deal with the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge.""[113]Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: ""It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?""[114]Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: ""It can mean so many things to so many different people.""[115]Political interpretations[edit]Hanks states that ""the film is non-political and thus non-judgmental"".[86]Nevertheless, CNN'sCrossfiredebated in 1994 whether the film promoted conservative values or was an indictment of thecounterculture of the 1960s. Thomas Byers called it ""an aggressively conservative film"" in aModern Fiction Studiesarticle.[116]All over the political map, people have been calling Forrest their own. But,Forrest Gumpisn't about politics or conservative values. It's about humanity, it's about respect, tolerance and unconditional love.—producerSteve Tisch[116]It has been noted that while Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny's life is full of countercultural embrace, complete with drug use, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation.[80]Jennifer Hyland Wang argues in aCinema Journalarticle that Jenny's death to an unnamed virus ""symbolizes the death of liberal America and the death of the protests that defined a decade"" in the 1960s. She also notes that the film's screenwriter,Eric Roth, developed the screenplay from the novel and transferred to Jenny ""all of Gump's flaws and most of the excesses committed by Americans in the 1960s and 1970s"".[88]Other commentators believe the film forecast the 1994Republican Revolutionand used the image of Forrest Gump to promote movement leaderNewt Gingrich's traditional, conservative values. Jennifer Hyland Wang observes that the film idealizes the 1950s, as made evident by the lack of ""Whites Only""-signs in Gump's Southern childhood, and envisions the 1960s as a period of social conflict and confusion. She argues that this sharp contrast between the decades criticizes the counterculture values and reaffirms conservatism.[88]Wang argues that the film was used by Republican politicians to illustrate a ""traditional version of recent history"" to gear voters toward their ideology for the congressional elections.[88]Presidential candidateBob Dolestated that the film's message was ""no matter how great the adversity, the American Dream is within everybody's reach"".[88]In 1995,National ReviewincludedForrest Gumpin its list of the ""Best 100 Conservative Movies"" of all time,[117]and ranked it number four on its ""25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years"" list.[118]National Review's John Miller wrote that ""Tom Hanks plays the title-character, an amiable dunce who is far too smart to embrace the lethal values of the 1960s. The love of his life, wonderfully played by Robin Wright Penn, chooses a different path; she becomes a drug-addled hippie, with disastrous results.""[119]Professor James Burton atSalisbury Universityargues that conservatives claimedForrest Gumpas their own due less to the content of the film and more to the historical and cultural context of 1994. Burton claims that the film's content and advertising campaign were affected by the cultural climate of the 1990s, which emphasizedfamily valuesand American values, epitomized in the bookHollywood vs. America. He claims that this climate influenced the apolitical nature of the film, which allowed many different political interpretations.[120]Some commentators see the conservative readings ofForrest Gumpas indicating the death of irony in American culture. Vivian Sobchack notes that the film's humor and irony rely on the assumption of the audience's historical knowledge.[120]Soundtrack[edit]Main articles:Forrest Gump: The SoundtrackandForrest Gump – Original Motion Picture ScoreThe soundtrack, featuring 32 songs from the film, was released on July 6, 1994. With the exception of a lengthy suite of themes fromAlan Silvestri's original score, all the songs are previously released. Among the artists featured in the film areElvis Presley,Bob Dylan,Hank Williams,Creedence Clearwater Revival,Aretha Franklin,Lynyrd Skynyrd,Three Dog Night,The Byrds,The Beach Boys,The Jimi Hendrix Experience,The Doors,Canned Heat,Harry Nilsson,The Mamas & the Papas,The Doobie Brothers,Simon & Garfunkel,Bob Seger,Randy Newman,Willie Nelson,Fleetwood Mac,KC & The Sunshine Band, andBuffalo Springfield. Reflecting on compiling the soundtrack, music producer Joel Sill stated ""We wanted to have very recognizable material that would pinpoint time periods, yet we didn't want to interfere with what was happening cinematically.""[121]The film and the two-disc album have a variety of music from the 1950s to the 1980s performed by American artists. According to Sill, Zemeckis requested this because he thought that American music was the only kind of music Forrest would buy, further stating ""All the material in there is American. Bob (Zemeckis) felt strongly about it. He felt that Forrest wouldn't buy anything but American.""[121]The soundtrack reached a peak of number 2 on theBillboardalbum chart.[121]The soundtrack went on to sell twelve million copies, and is one of the top selling albums in the US.[122]The Oscar-nominatedscorefor the film was composed and conducted byAlan Silvestriand released on August 2, 1994.Adaptations[edit]Novel-sequel[edit]Main article:Gump and Co.The screenplay for the sequel was written byEric Rothin 2001. It is based on the original novel's sequel,Gump and Co., written by Winston Groom in 1995. Roth's script begins with Forrest sitting on a bench waiting for his son to return from school. After theSeptember 11 attacks, Roth, Zemeckis, and Hanks decided the story was no longer ""relevant.""[123]In March 2007, however, it was reported Paramount producers took another look at the screenplay.[99]On the first page of the sequel novel, Forrest Gump tells readers ""Don't never let nobody make a movie of your life's story,"" and ""Whether they get it right or wrong, it doesn't matter.""[124]The first chapter of the book suggests the real-life events surrounding the film have been incorporated into Forrest's storyline, and that Forrest got a lot of media attention as a result of the film.[21]During the course of the sequel novel, Gump runs into Tom Hanks and at the end of the novel in the film's release, includes Gump going onThe David Letterman Showand attending theAcademy Awards.Indian remake[edit]Main article:Laal Singh ChaddhaTheIndian filmLaal Singh Chaddha, released in August 2022 and starringAamir KhanandKareena Kapoorin the title role, is an authorized remake ofForrest Gump, set in India between the late 1970s and the 2010s. The film was directed byAdvait Chandanand produced by Aamir Khan Productions,Viacom18 StudiosandParamount Pictures.[125]Fake sequel trailers[edit]Following the advent of AI video editing, several fake trailers were created and gained attention, some featuring an older Tom Hanks costarring with actors likeTom HollandorTimothée Chalamet.[126]Hanks himself has said that he is glad that a sequel was never made, given the completeness of the original film.[126]See also[edit]Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, a real American restaurant chain based on the filmList of American football filmsList of films about the sport of athleticsReferences[edit]^abc""Forrest Gump (1994)"".AFI Catalog of Feature Films.Archivedfrom the original on June 29, 2021.

Based on theDC ComicssuperheroBatman, it is the sequel toBatman Begins(2005), and the second installment inThe Dark Knighttrilogy. The plot follows the vigilanteBatman, police lieutenantJames Gordon, and district attorneyHarvey Dent, who form an alliance to dismantleorganized crimeinGotham City. Their efforts are derailed by theJoker, an anarchistic mastermind who seeks to test how far Batman will go to save the city from chaos. Theensemble castincludesChristian Bale,Michael Caine,Heath Ledger,Gary Oldman,Aaron Eckhart,Maggie Gyllenhaal, andMorgan Freeman.Warner Bros. Picturesprioritized a sequel following the successful reinvention of theBatmanfilm serieswithBatman Begins. Christopher andBatman Beginsco-writerDavid S. Goyerdeveloped the story elements, making Dent the central protagonist caught up in the battle between Batman and the Joker. In writing the screenplay, the Nolans were influenced by 1980sBatmancomics and crime drama films, and sought to continueBatman Begins'heightened sense of realism. From April to November 2007, filming took place with a $185million budget in Chicago and Hong Kong, and on sets in England.The Dark Knightwas the first major motion picture to be filmed with high-resolutionIMAXcameras. Christopher avoided usingcomputer-generated imageryunless necessary, insisting on practicalstuntssuch as flipping an18-wheel truckand blowing up a factory.The Dark Knightwas marketed with an innovative interactiveviral campaignthat initially focused on countering criticism of Ledger's casting by those who believed he was a poor choice to portray the Joker. Ledger died from an accidental prescription drug overdose in January 2008, leading to widespread interest from the press and public regarding his performance. When it was released in July,The Dark Knightreceived acclaim for its mature tone and themes, visual style, and performances—particularly that of Ledger, who received many posthumous awards includingAcademy,BAFTA, andGolden Globeawards for Best Supporting Actor, makingThe Dark Knightthe first comic-book film to receive major industry awards. It broke several box-office records and became thehighest-grossing 2008 film, thefourth-highest-grossing film to that time, and the highest-grossing superhero film.Since its release,The Dark Knighthas been assessed as one of the greatest superhero films ever, one of the best movies of the 2000s, and one of thebest films ever made. It is considered the ""blueprint"" for many modern superhero films, particularly for its rejection of a typical comic-book movie style in favor of a crime film that features comic-book characters. Many filmmakers sought to repeat its success by emulating its gritty, realistic tone to varying degrees of success.The Dark Knighthas been analyzed for its themes of terrorism and the limitations of morality and ethics. The United StatesLibrary of Congressselected it for preservation in theNational Film Registryin 2020. A sequel,The Dark Knight Rises, concludedThe Dark Knighttrilogy in 2012.PlotA gang of masked criminals rob amafia-owned bank inGotham City, betraying and killing each other until the sole survivor, theJoker, reveals himself as the mastermind and escapes with the money. The vigilanteBatman, district attorneyHarvey Dent, and police lieutenantJim Gordonally to eliminate Gotham's organized crime. Batman's true identity, the billionaire Bruce Wayne, publicly supports Dent as Gotham's legitimate protector, believing Dent's success will allow him to retire as Batman and romantically pursue his childhood friendRachel Dawes—despite her being with Dent.Gotham's mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations from the Joker, the police, and Batman. The Joker interrupts the meeting and offers to kill Batman for half of the fortune their accountant, Lau, concealed before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoidextradition. With the help ofWayne EnterprisesCEOLucius Fox, Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and returns him to the custody of Gotham police. His testimony enables Dent to apprehend the crime families. The bosses accept the Joker's offer, and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial, including the judge and police commissioner. Although Gordon saves the mayor, the Joker threatens that his attacks will continue until Batman reveals his identity. He targets Dent at a fundraising dinner and throws Rachel out of a window, but Batman rescues her.Wayne struggles to understand the Joker's motives, to which his butlerAlfred Pennyworthsays ""some men just want to watch the world burn."" Dent claims he is Batman to lure out the Joker, who attacks the police convoy transporting him. Batman and Gordon apprehend the Joker, and Gordon is promoted to commissioner. At the police station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who says he finds Batman entertaining and has no intention of killing him. Having deduced Batman's feelings for Rachel, the Joker reveals she and Dent are being held separately in buildings rigged to explode. Batman races to rescue Rachel while Gordon and the other officers go after Dent, but they discover the Joker gave their positions in reverse. The explosives detonate, killing Rachel and severely burning Dent's face on one side. The Joker escapes custody, extracts the fortune's location from Lau, and burns it, killing Lau in the process.Coleman Reese, a consultant for Wayne Enterprises, deduces and tries to expose Batman's identity, but the Joker threatens to blow up a hospital unless Reese is killed. While the police evacuate hospitals and Gordon struggles to keep Reese alive, the Joker meets with a disillusioned Dent, persuading him to take the law into his own hands and avenge Rachel. Dent defers his decision-making to his now half-scarred, two-headed coin, killing the corrupt officers and the mafia involved in Rachel's death. As panic grips the city, the Joker reveals two evacuation ferries, one carrying civilians and the other prisoners, are rigged to explode at midnight unless one group sacrifices the other. To the Joker's disbelief, the passengers refuse to kill one another. Batman subdues the Joker but refuses to kill him. Before the police arrest the Joker, he says although Batman proved incorruptible, his plan to corrupt Dent has succeeded.Dent takes Gordon's family hostage, blaming his negligence for Rachel's death. He flips his coin to decide their fates, but Batman tackles him to save Gordon's son, and Dent falls to his death. Believing Dent is the hero the city needs and the truth of his corruption will harm Gotham, Batman takes the blame for his death and actions and persuades Gordon to conceal the truth. Pennyworth burns an undelivered letter from Rachel to Wayne that says she chose Dent, and Fox destroys the invasive surveillance network that helped Batman find the Joker. The city mourns Dent as a hero, and the police launch a manhunt for Batman.Cast(LtoR)Christian Bale(pictured in 2019),Gary Oldman(2014), andAaron Eckhart(2016)Christian BaleasBruce Wayne / Batman: A wealthy socialite who as a child was traumatized by his parents' murder.

Picturesprioritized a sequel.[31]AlthoughBatman Beginsends with a scene in which Batman is presented with ajoker playing card, teasing the introduction of his archenemy, the Joker,Christopher Nolandid not intend to make a sequel and was unsureBatman Beginswould be successful enough to warrant one.[32][33]Christopher, alongside his wife and longtime producerEmma Thomas, had never worked on a sequel film[34]but he and co-writerDavid Goyerdiscussed ideas for a sequel during filming. Goyer developed an outline for two sequels, but Christopher remained unsure how to continue theBatman Beginsnarrative while keeping it consistent and relevant, though he was interested in utilizing the Joker inBegins'sgrounded, realistic style.[31][33][34]Discussions between Warner Bros. Pictures and Christopher began shortly afterBatman Begins's theatrical release, and development began following the production of Christopher'sThe Prestige(2006).[31]Writing(LtoR) Director and writerChristopher Nolan(pictured in 2018), and co-writerJonathan Nolan(2019)Goyer and Christopher collaborated for three months to developThe Dark Knight'score plot points.[34]They wanted to explore the theme of escalation and the idea that Batman's extraordinary efforts to combat common crimes would lead to an opposing escalation by criminals, attracting the Joker, who uses terrorism as a weapon. The joker playing card scene inBatman Beginswas intended to convey the fallacy of Batman's belief his war on crime would be temporary.[33][35]Goyer and Christopher did not intentionally include real-world parallels to terrorism, thewar on terror, and laws enacted to combat terrorists by the United States government because they believed making overtly political statements would detract from the story. They wanted it to resonate with and reflect contemporary audiences.[34]Christopher describedThe Dark Knightas representative of his own ""fear of anarchy"" and Joker represents ""somebody who wants to just tear down the world around him.""[36]Although he was a fan ofBatman(1989), starringJack Nicholsonas the Joker, Goyer did not consider Nicholson's portrayal scary and wantedThe Dark Knight's Joker to be an unknowable, already-formed character, similar to the shark inJaws(1975), without a ""cliché"" origin story.[e]Christopher and Goyer did not give their Joker an origin story or a narrative arc, believing it made the character scarier; Christopher described their film as the ""rise of the Joker"". They felt the threat of cinematic villains such asHannibal LecterandDarth Vaderhad been undermined by subsequent films depicting their origins.[f]With Christopher's help, his brotherJonathanspent six months developing the story into a draft screenplay. After submitting the draft to Warner Bros., Jonathan spent a further two months refining it until Christopher had finished directingThe Prestige. The pair collaborated on the final script over the next six months during pre-production forThe Dark Knight.[34][40]Jonathan found the ""poignant"" ending the script's most interesting aspect; it had always depicted Batman fleeing from police but was changed from him leaping across rooftops to escaping on theBatpod, his motorcycle-like vehicle. The dialogue Jonathan considered most important, ""you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"", came late in development.[40]Influenced by films such asThe Godfather(1972) andHeat(1995), and maintainingBatman Begins'stone, their finished script bore more resemblance to a crime drama than a traditionalsuperhero film.[g]Comic-book influences included writerFrank Miller's 1980s works, which portray characters in a serious tone, and the limited seriesBatman: The Long Halloween(1996–1997), which explores the relationship between Batman, Dent, and Gordon.[37][42]Dent was written asThe Dark Knight'scentral character, serving as the center of the battle between Batman, who believes Dent is the hero the city needs, and the Joker, who wants to prove even the most righteous people can be corrupted. Christopher said the title refers to Dent as much as Batman.[h]He considered Dent as having a duality similar to Batman's, providing interesting dramatic potential.[10]Focusing on Dent meant Bruce Wayne / Batman was written as a generally static character who did not undergo drastic character development.[34][43][44]Christopher found writing the Joker the easiest aspect of the script. The Nolans identified the traits common to his media incarnations and were influenced by the character's comic-book appearances as well as the villainDr. Mabusefrom the films ofFritz Lang.[33][38]WriterAlan Moore'sgraphic novel,Batman: The Killing Joke(1988), did not influence the main narrative but Christopher believed his interpretation of the Joker as someone partially driven to prove anyone can become like him when pushed far enough helped the Nolans give purpose to an ""inherently purposeless"" character.[33][34][38]The Joker was written as a purely evil psychopath and anarchist who lacks reason, logic, and fear, and could test the moral and ethical limits of Batman, Dent, and Gordon.[i]Christopher and Jonathan later realized they had inadvertently written their version similarly to Joker's first appearance inBatman#1 (1940).[j]The final scene, in which the Joker states he and Batman are destined to battle forever, was not intended to tease a sequel but to convey the diametrically opposed pair were in an endless conflict because they will not kill each other.[46]CastingSee also:Joker (The Dark Knight)Maggie Gyllenhaal(pictured in 2010) replacedKatie Holmesin the role of assistant district attorney Rachel Dawes.Describing how his character had evolved fromBatman Begins, Christian Bale said Wayne had changed from a young, naive, and angry man seeking purpose to a hero who is burdened by the realization his war against crime is seemingly endless.[47][48][49]Because the new Batsuit allowed him to be more agile, Bale did not increase his muscle mass as much as he had forBatman Begins. Christopher had deliberately obscured combat in the previous film because it was intended to portray Batman from the criminals' point of view. The improved Batsuit design let him show more of Bale's Keysi-fighting method training.[50]Christopher was aware that Nicholson's popular portrayal of the Joker would invite comparisons to his version, and wanted an actor who could cope with the associated scrutiny.[k]Ledger's casting in August 2006 was criticized by some industry professionals and members of the public who considered him inappropriate for the role; executive producerCharles Rovensaid Ledger was the only person seriously considered, and thatBatman Begins'spositive reception would help alleviate any concerns.[l]Christopher was confident in the casting because discussions between himself and Ledger had demonstrated they shared similar ideas regarding the Joker's portrayal.[33][51]Ledger said he had some trepidation in succeeding Nicholson in the role but that the challenge excited him.[33][54]He described his interpretation as a ""psychopathic, mass-murdering, schizophrenic clown with zero empathy"", and avoided humanizing him. He was influenced byAlexfrom the crime filmA Clockwork Orange(1971), and British musiciansJohnny RottenandSid Vicious.[m]Ledger spent about a month secluding himself in a hotel room while reading relevant comic books. He developed the character's voice by mixing a high-pitch and low-pitch, which was inspired by ventriloquist performances. His fighting style was designed to appear improvised and erratic.[n]Ledger spent a further four months creating a ""Joker diary"" containing images and elements he believed would resonate with his character, such as finding the diseaseAIDShumorous.[58]Describing his performance, Ledger said: ""It's the most fun I've had with a character and probably will ever have... It was an exhausting process. At the end of the day, I couldn't move. I couldn't talk. I was absolutely wrecked.""[56]In a November 2007 interview, Ledger said when committing himself to any role, he had difficulty sleeping because he could not relax his mind, and often slept only two hours a night during filming.[58]Christopher wanted to cast an actor with an all-American ""heroic presence"" for Harvey Dent, something he likened toRobert Redfordbut with an undercurrent of anger or darkness.[51]Josh Lucas,Ryan Phillippe, andMark Ruffalowere considered, as well asMatt Damon, who could not commit due to scheduling conflicts.[o]According to Christopher, Eckhart had the all-American charm and ""aura ... of a good man pushed too far"".[10][51]Eckhart found portraying conflicted characters to be interesting; he said the difference between Dent and Batman is the distance they are willing to go for their causes, and that after Dent's corruption he remains a crime fighter but he takes this to an extreme because he dislikes the restrictions of the law.[10][65]Eckhart's performance was influenced by theKennedy family, particularlyRobert F. Kennedy, who fought organized crime with a similarly idealistic view of the law.[66]During discussions on the portrayal of Dent's transformation into Two-Face, Eckhart and Christopher agreed to ignoreTommy Lee Jones's ""colorful"" portrayal inBatman Forever(1995), in which the character has pink hair and wears a split designer suit, in favor of a more realistic, slightly burnt, neutral-toned suit.[66]Describing his role as GCPD Lieutenant James Gordon, Oldman said Gordon is the ""moral center"" ofThe Dark Knight, an honest and incorruptible character struggling with the limits of his morality.[67][68]Maggie Gyllenhaal replacedKatie Holmesas Rachel Dawes, as Holmes chose to star in the crime comedyMad Money(2008) instead.[69][70]Gyllenhaal approached Rachel as a new character and did not reference Holmes's previous performance. Christopher described Rachel as the emotional connection between Wayne and Dent, ultimately serving as a further personal loss to fuel Wayne's character. Gyllenhaal collaborated with Christopher on the character's depiction because she wanted Rachel to be important and meaningful in her relatively minor role.[p]MusicianDwight Yoakamturned down a role as the bank manager or a corrupt police officer because he was recording his albumDwight Sings Buck(2007).[73]Hong Kong actorEdison Chenhad a role in the film, but this was mostly cut following his involvement in asex photo scandal.[74][75]Pre-productionIn October 2006, location scouting for Gotham City took place in the UK inLiverpool,Glasgow, London, and parts ofYorkshire, and in several cities in the U.S.[76][77]Christopher chose Chicago because he liked the area and believed it offered interesting architectural features without being as recognizable as locations in better-known cities such as New York City.[34][78]Chicagoan authorities had been supportive during filming ofBatman Begins, allowing the production to shut stretches of roads, freeways, and bridges.[79]Christopher wanted to exchange the more natural, scenic settings ofBatman Beginssuch as theHimalayasand caverns for a modern, structured environment the Joker could disassemble. Production designerNathan Crowleysaid the clean, neat lines of Chicagoan architecture enhanced the urban-crime drama they wanted to make, and that Batman had helped improve the city. The destruction of Wayne Manor inBatman Beginsprovided an opportunity to move Wayne to a modern, sparse penthouse, reflecting his loneliness.[80]Sets were still used for some interiors such as the Bat Bunker, the replacement for theBatcave, on the outskirts of the city. The production team considered placing it in the penthouse basement but believed it was too unrealistic a solution.[81]Much ofThe Dark Knightwas filmed usingPanavision'sPanaflex Millennium XL and Platinum cameras but Christopher wanted to film about 40 minutes withIMAXcameras, a high-resolution technology using70 mm filmrather than the more-commonly used format35 mm; the finished film includes 15–20% IMAX footage, running for about 28 minutes.[q]This made it the first major motion picture to use IMAX technology, which was generally employed for documentaries.[r]Warner Bros. was reluctant to endorse the use of the technology because the cameras were large and unwieldy, and purchasing and processing the film stock cost up to four times as much as typical 35 mm film. Christopher said cameras that could be used onMount Everestcould be used forThe Dark Knight, and had cinematographerWally Pfisterand his crew begin training to use the equipment in January 2007 to test its feasibility.[87][88][89]Christopher particularly wanted to film the bank heist prologue in IMAX to immediately convey the difference in scope betweenThe Dark KnightandBatman Begins.[90]Filming in ChicagoSee also:Stunts ofThe Dark KnightA photograph of the Chicago skyline behindNavy Pier.The Dark Knightwas mainly filmed on location in the city.Principal photographybegan on April 18, 2007, in Chicago on a $185million budget.[s][t]ForThe Dark Knight, Pfister chose to combine the ""rust-style"" visuals ofBatman Beginswith the ""dusk""-like color scheme ofThe Prestige(cobalt blues, greens, blacks, and whites), in part to address over-dark scenes inBatman Begins.[82][95]To avoid attention, filming in Chicago took place under the working titleRory's First Kissbut the production's true nature was quickly uncovered by media publications.[96]The Joker's homemade videos were filmed and mainly directed by Ledger. Caine said he forgot his lines during a scene involving one video because of Ledger's ""stunning"" performance.[33]The first scene filmed was the bank heist, which was shot in theOld Chicago Main Post Officeover five days.[82][97]It was scheduled early to test the IMAX procedure, allowing it to be refilmed with traditional cameras if needed, and it was intended to be publicly released as part of the marketing campaign.[98]Pfister described it as a week of patience and learning because of the four-day wait for the IMAX footage to be processed.[90]Filming moved to England throughout May, returning to Chicago in June.[82][99]Filming took place in the lobby ofOne Illinois Center, which served as Wayne's penthouse apartment; bookcases were built to hide the elevators. A floor of Two Illinois Center was decorated for Wayne's fundraiser. The crew was described as excited as this scene depicted the first meeting between Batman and the Joker. The windows in both settings were covered ingreen screenmaterial, allowing Gotham City visuals to be added later.[82][100]In July, three weeks were spent filming the truck chase scene, mainly onWacker Drive, a multi-level street that had to be closed overnight.[101][102]During filming, Christopher added a set-piece of a SWAT van crashing through a concrete barricade.[103]The sequence continued onLaSalle Street, which was also used for the GCPD funeral procession, for a practical truck-flip stunt and helicopter sequence.[104]Additional segments were filmed on Monroe Street andRandolph Street, and atRandolph Street Station.[102][105][106]Navy Pier, along the shore ofLake Michigan, served as Gotham Harbor in a climactic ferry scene. Scouts spent over a month searching for suitable vessels but were unsuccessful, so construction coordinator Joe Ondrejko and his team built ferry facades atop barges.[102][107]The entire sequence was filmed in one day and involved 800extras, who were moved through makeup and clothing departments in shifts.[108]Exterior footage of the Gotham Prewitt Building, the site of Batman's and the Joker's final confrontation, was filmed at the in-constructionTrump International Hotel and Tower. The owners refused permission to film a stunt in which Batman suspends a SWAT team from the building, so this was filmed from the fortieth floor of a separate building site.[109]A formerBrach'scandy factory onCicero Avenuescheduled for demolition was used to film the Gotham General Hospital explosion in August 2007.[102][110]Filming in Chicago concluded on September 1, ending with scenes of Wayne driving and crashing his car, before the production returned to England.[102][111]The Dark Knightincludes Chicago locations such as Lake Michigan, which doubled as theCaribbean Seawhere Wayne boards a seaplane;[108]Richard J. Daley Center(Wayne Enterprises exteriors and a courtroom);[102][112]The Berghoffrestaurant (GCPD arresting mobsters);[102]Twin Anchors restaurant; the Sound Bar;McCormick Place(Wayne Enterprises interiors); andChicago Theatre.[102]330 North Wabashserved as offices used by Dent, mayor Garcia, and commissioner Loeb; and its thirteenth floor appears as Wayne Enterprises' boardroom; Pfister enhanced its large, panoramic windows and natural light with an 80-foot (24 m) glass table and reflective bulbs.[100]A Randolph Street parking garage is where Batman captures Scarecrow and Batman impersonators. Christopher wanted severalRottweilerdogs in the scene but locating a dog-handler willing to simultaneously manage several dogs was difficult.[102][113]A scene of Batman surveying the city from a rooftop edge was filmed atopWillis Tower, Chicago's tallest building. Stuntman Buster Reeves was due to double as Batman, but Bale persuaded the filmmakers to let him perform the scene himself.[102][114][115]The thirteen weeks of filming in Chicago was estimated to have generated $45million for the city's economy and thousands of local jobs.[116][117]Filming in England and Hong KongSeveral sets were built atCardington Airfieldincluding the vast Bat BunkerMany interior locations forThe Dark Knightwere filmed on sets atPinewood Studios,Buckinghamshire, andCardington Airfield,Bedfordshire; these locations include the Bat Bunker, which took six weeks to build in a Cardington hangar. The Bat Bunker was based on 1960s Chicago building designs, and was integrated into existing concrete floor, and used the 200-foot (61 m) long, 8 ft (2.4 m) tall ceiling to create a broad perspective. The 160-foot (49 m) tall hangar was unsuitable for suspending the bunker roof, and an encompassing gantry was built to hold it and the lighting.[82][118]After moving from Chicago in May, scenes filmed in the UK also includeCriterion Restaurant, where Rachel, Dent, and Wayne share dinner, and a Gotham News scene that was filmed at theUniversity of Westminster. The GCPD headquarters was rebuilt in theFarmiloe Building. During the interrogation scene, Ledger asked Bale to physically hit him and, although he declined, Ledger cracked and dented the walls by throwing himself around.[118][119]After returning to England in the middle of September, scenes were filmed for the ferry, hospital, and Gotham Prewitt building interiors.[120]By mid-October, interior and exterior scenes of Rachel being held hostage surrounded by barrels of gasoline were filmed atBattersea Power Station. To avoid damaging the power station, alisted building, a false wall was built in front of it and lined with explosives.[121]Nearby residents contacted emergency services believing the explosion was a terrorist attack.[122]Filming in England concluded at the end of October with a variety of green-screen shots for the truck-chase sequence, and shots of Rachel being thrown from a window were filmed on a set at Cardington.[123]The final nine days of production took place in Hong Kong and included aerial footage from atop theInternational Finance Centre, as well as filming atCentral to Mid-Levels escalator,The Center,Central,The Peninsula Hong Kong, andQueen's Road; and a stunt involving Batman catching an in-flightC-130aircraft.[u]Despite extensive rehearsals of Reeves jumping from theMcClurg Buildingin Chicago, a planned stunt to depict Batman leaping from one Hong Kong skyscraper to another was canceled because local authorities refused permission for helicopter use; Pfister described the officials as a ""nightmare"".[60][128]Christopher disputed a report that said a scene of Batman leaping intoVictoria Harbourwas canceled because of pollution concerns, saying it was a script decision.[124][125]The 127-day shoot concluded on November 15, on time and under budget.[129]Post-productionEditing was underway in January 2008 when Ledger, aged 28, died from an accidental overdose of a prescription drug. A rumor his commitment to his performance as the Joker had affected his mental state circulated, but this was later refuted.[v]Christopher said editing the film became ""tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day [during editing]... but the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish"".[57]Because Christopher preferred to capture sound while filming rather thanre-recording dialogue in post-production, Ledger's work had been completed before his death, and Christopher did not modify the Joker's narrative in response.[60][132]Christopher added a dedication to Ledger and stuntman Conway Wickliffe, who died during rehearsals for a Tumbler (Batmobile) stunt.[133][134][135]Alongside lead editorLee Smith, Christopher took an ""aggressive editorial approach"" to editingThe Dark Knightto achieve its 152-minute running time.[w]Christopher said no scenes were deleted because he believed every scene was essential, and that unnecessary material had been cut before filming.[136]The Nolans had difficulties refining the script to reduce the running time. After removing so much material they believed the story had become incomprehensible, they added more scenes.[34]Special effects and designMain article:Special effects ofThe Dark KnightUnlike the design process ofBatman Begins, which was restrained by a need to represent Batman iconography, audience acceptance of its realistic setting gaveThe Dark Knightmore design freedom.[139]Chris Corbould, the film'sspecial effects supervisor,[140]oversaw the 700 effect shotsDouble NegativeandFramestoreproduced; there were relatively few effects compared to equivalent films because Christopher only usedcomputer-generated imagingwhere practical effects would not suffice.[141]Production designerNathan Crowleydesigned the Batpod (Batcycle) because Christopher did not want to extensively re-use the Tumbler. Corbould's team built the Batpod, which is based on a prototype Crowley and Christopher built bycombining different commercial model components.[142][143]The unwieldy, wide-tired vehicle could only be ridden by stuntman Jean Pierre Goy after months of training.[115][143][144]The Gotham General Hospital explosion was not in the script but added during filming because Corbould believed it could be done.[145]Hemming, Crowley, Christopher, and Jamie Rama re-designed the Batsuit to make it more comfortable and flexible, developing a costume made from a stretchy material covered in over 100 urethane armor pieces.[146][147]Sculptor Julian Murray developed Dent's burnt-facial design, which is based on Christopher's request for a skeletal appearance. Murray went through designs that were ""too real and more horrifying"" before settling on a more ""fanciful"" and detailed but less-repulsive version.[65][148]Hemming designed Joker's overall appearance, which he based on fashion-and-music celebrities to create a modern and trendy look. Influence also came from the 1953 paintingStudy after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent XbyFrancis Bacon—suggested by Christopher—and the character's comic-book appearances.[33][149][150]The outfit consists of a purple coat, a green vest, an antique shirt, and a thin, 1960s-style tie that Ledger suggested.[151]Prosthetics supervisorConor O'Sullivancreated Joker's scars, which he partly based on a scarred delivery man he met, and used his own technique to create and apply the supple, skin-like prosthesis.[33][152]John Caglione Jrdesigned Joker's ""organic"" makeup to look as though it had been worn for days; this idea was partly based on more of Bacon's works. Caglione Jr used a theatrical makeup technique for the application; he instructed Ledger to scrunch up his face so different cracks and textures were created once the makeup was applied and Ledger relaxed. Ledger always applied the lipstick himself, believing it was essential to his characterization.[33][153][154]MusicMain article:The Dark Knight(soundtrack)James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer – Why So Serious?Zimmer based Joker's theme around two notes that would become increasingly ""agitated as the track progressed. He added a ""punk"" influence alongside inspirations from electronic and rock music.""Problems playing this file? Seemedia help.ComposersJames Newton HowardandHans Zimmer, who had also worked onBatman Begins, scoredThe Dark Knightbecause Christopher believed it was important to bridge the musical-narrative gap between the films. The score was recorded atAir Studios, London. Howard and Zimmer composed the score without seeing the film because Christopher wanted them to be influenced by the characters and story rather than fitting specific on-screen elements.[155][156]Howard and Zimmer separated their duties by character; Howard focused on Dent and Zimmer focused on Batman and the Joker. Zimmer did not consider Batman to be strictly noble and wrote the theme to not seem ""super"".[157][158]Howard wrote about ten minutes of music for Dent, wanting to portray him as an American who represents hope, but undergoes an emotional extreme and moral corruption. He used brass instruments for both moral ends but warped the sound as Dent is corrupted.[155][157]Zimmer wanted to use a single note for the Joker's theme; he said, ""imagine one note that starts off slightly agitated and then goes to serious aggravation and finally rips your head off at the end"". He could not make it work, however, and used two notes with alternating tempos and a ""punk"" influence.[155][157][158]The theme was influenced byelectronic musicinnovatorsKraftwerkand Zimmer's work with rock bandThe Damned. He wanted to convey elements of the Joker's corrosion, recklessness, and ""otherworldliness"" by combining electronic and orchestral music, and modifying almost every note after recording to emulate sounds including thunder and razors.[155][158][159]He attempted to develop original sounds with synthesizers, trying to create an ""offputting"" result by instructing musicians to start with a single note and gradually shift to the second over a three-minute period; the musicians found this difficult because it was the opposite of their training.[157]It took several months to achieve Zimmer's desired result.[158]Following Ledger's death, Zimmer considered discarding the theme for a more traditional one but he and Howard believed they should honor Ledger's performance.[x]ReleaseMarketing and anti-piracyA presentation covering aspects of the marketing, including Joker-defaced $1 bills, fans in Joker makeup, and web pages designed to recruit people to the Joker's army.The Dark Knight's marketing campaign was developed byalternate reality game(ARG) development company42 Entertainment. Christopher wanted the team to focus on countering the negative reaction to Ledger's casting and controlling the revelation of the Joker's appearance.[161]Influenced by the script and the comic booksThe Killing Joke,The Long Halloween, andArkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth(1989), 42 Entertainment paced the ARG over annual events, although Warner Bros. rejected their ideas to use Jokerized Santas at Christmas, coffins filled with chattering teeth on Mother's Day (mocking Wayne's late mother), and Batman actors on rooftops due to safety concerns.[161][162]The ARG began in May 2007 with campaign posters for Dent and Joker playing cards bearing the phrase ""I believe in Harvey Dent"" were hidden inside comic books at stores around the U.S. This led people to a website where they could submit their e-mail addresses to reveal a pixel of a concealed Joker image; about 97,000 e-mail addresses and 20 hours were required to reveal the image in full, which was well received. AtSan Diego Comic-Con, 42 Entertainment modified 11,000 one-dollar bills with the Joker's image and the phrase ""Why So Serious?"" that led finders to a location. 42 Entertainment's initial plan to throw the bills from a balcony was canceled due to safety concerns, so the bills were covertly distributed to attendees. Although the event was expected to attract a few thousand people, 650,000 arrived and participated in activities that included calling a number taken from a plane flying overhead and wearing Joker makeup to commit disruptive acts with actors.[161][162][163]Globally, fans photographed letters on signs to form aransom note. A U.S.-centric effort involved people recovering cellphones made byNokia—a brand partner to the film—from a cake, which led to an early screening of the film's bank-heist prologue before its public release in December. Ledger's appearance in the prologue was well-received and positively changed the discourse around his casting.[y]Following Ledger's death, the campaign continued unchanged with a focus on Dent's election, which was influenced by the ongoing2008 United States presidential election. Warner Bros. was concerned public knowledge of Dent's character was poor; the campaign included signs, stickers, and ""Dentmobiles"" visiting U.S. cities to raise his profile. The campaign concluded in July with displays of theBat-Signalin Chicago and New York City that were eventually defaced by the Joker. Industry professionals considered the campaign innovative and successful.[z]Warner Bros. dedicated six months toanti-piracy methods; the film industry lost an estimated $6.1billion to piracy in 2005. Delivery methods of film reels were randomized and copies had achain of custodyto track who had access. Some theater staff were given night-vision goggles to identify people recordingThe Dark Knight, and one person was caught inKansas City. Warner Bros. considered its strategy a success, delaying the appearance of the first ""poorly-lit""camcorderversion until 38–48 hours after its earliest global release in Australia.[173][174]ContextSee also:2008 in filmCast and crew in London at the European premiere ofThe Dark KnightCompared to 2007's $9.7billion box-office take, in 2008, lower revenues were expected due to the large number of comedies competing against each other and the release of films with dark tones, such asThe Dark Knight, during a period of rising living costs and election fatigue in the U.S. Fewer sequels, which generally performed well, were scheduled and only four—The Dark Knight,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, andIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull—were predicted to beblockbusters.Kingdom of the Crystal Skullwas the only film expected to easily earn over $300million.[175]The Dark Knightwas expected to sell well based on high audience anticipation, positive pre-release reviews, and a record $3.5million in IMAX pre-sales. Predictions placed its opening-weekend take above that ofIron Man's $102.1million but below that ofSpider-Man 3's (2007) record $151.1million. Analysts said its success would be influenced by the lengthy running time that limited the number of screenings per day, andcounter-programmingfrom the romantic comedyMamma Mia!—which surveyed well with women—and the family comedySpace Chimps. There was also a perceived limit on financial success forBatmanfilms; the 1989 installment remained the franchise's highest-grossing release.[176][177]The Dark Knight's premiere took place on July 14, in IMAX in New York City. A block inBroadwaywas closed for the event, which included a live performance of the film score by Howard and Zimmer.The Hollywood Reportersaid Ledger received several ovations, and that during the after-party, Warner Bros. executives struggled to maintain a balance between celebrating the successful response and commemorating Ledger.[178]Box officeThe Tumbler at the film's European premiere inLeicester Square, LondonOn July 18, 2008,The Dark Knightwas widely released in the U.S. and Canada in a record 4,366 theaters on an estimated 9,200 screens. It earned $158.4million during the weekend, a per-theater average of $36,282, breakingSpider-Man 3's record and making it the number-one film ahead ofMamma Mia!($27.8million) andHancock($14million) in its third weekend.[aa]It set further records for the highest-grossing single-day ($67.2million on the Friday), Sunday ($43.6million), midnight opening ($18.5million, from 3,000 midnight screenings), and IMAX opening ($6.3million from about 94 locations), as well as the second-highest-grossing Saturday ($47.7million) behindSpider-Man 3, and contributed to the highest-grossing weekend on record ($253.6million).[ab]The film benefited from repeat viewings by younger audiences and had broad appeal, with 52% of the audience being male and an equal number of those under 25 years old, and those of 25 or older.[176][177][185]The Dark Knightbroke more records, including for the highest-grossing opening week ($238.6million), and for three-, four-, five-, six-, seven-, eight-, nine-, and ten-day cumulative grosses, including the highest-grossing non-holiday Monday ($24.5million) and non-opening Tuesday ($20.9million, as well as the second-highest-grossing non-opening Wednesday ($18.4million), behindTransformers($29.1million).[ac]It retained the number-one position in its second weekend with a total gross of $75.2million, ahead of the debutingStep Brothers($31million), giving it the highest-grossing second weekend.[190][191]It retained the number-one position in its third ($42.7million) and fourth ($26.1million) weekends, before falling to second place in its fifth, with a gross of $16.4million, behind the debutingTropic Thunder($25.8million).[192][193][194]The Dark Knightremained in the top-ten highest-grossing films for ten weeks, and became the film to surpass $400million soonest (18 days) and $500million (45 days).[180][195][196]The film was playing in fewer than 100 theaters when it received a 300-theater relaunch in late January 2009 to raise its profile during nominations for the81st Academy Awards. This raised its total box office to $533.3million before it left theaters on March 5 after 33 weeks, making it the highest-grossing comic-book, superhero, andBatmanfilm; the highest-grossing film of 2008; and the second-highest-grossing film ever (unadjusted for inflation), behind the 1997 romantic dramaTitanic($600.8million).[ad]The Dark Knightwas released in Australia and Taiwan on Wednesday, July 16, 2008, and opened in twenty markets by the weekend. It earned about $40million combined, making it second toHancock($44.8million), which was playing in nearly four times as many countries.[ae]The Dark Knightwas available in sixty-two countries by the end of August, although Warner Bros. decided not to release it in China, blaming ""a number of pre-release conditions... as well as cultural sensitivities to some elements of the film"".[207]The Dark Knightearned about $469.7million outside the U.S. and Canada, its highest grosses coming from the United Kingdom ($89.1million), Australia ($39.9million), Germany ($29.7million), France ($27.5million), Mexico ($25million), South Korea ($24.7million), and Brazil ($20.2million). This made it the second-highest-grossing film of the year behindIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.[203][208]The film had grossed $997 million worldwide by January 2009.[202][209]Its reissue in the run-up to the Oscars enabled the film to exceed $1billion in February,[210]and it ultimately earned $1.003billion. It was the first superhero film to gross over $1billion, the highest-grossing film of 2008 worldwide, the fourth film to earn more than $1billion, and the fourth-highest-grossing film of its time behindPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest($1.066billion),The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King($1.119billion), andTitanic($1.842billion).[af][ag]As of June 2025,[update]rereleases have further raised its box-office take to $1.009 billion.[92]ReceptionCritical responseHeath Ledger (pictured in 2007). His performance was praised by critics although they often found his scenes difficult to watch in the wake of his death.The Dark Knightreceived critical acclaim.[ah]OnRotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 347 critics, with an average score of 8.6/10. The consensus reads; ""Dark, complex and unforgettable,The Dark Knightsucceeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga.""[219]OnMetacriticthe film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[218]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.[220]Several publications calledThe Dark Knightthe best comic-book hero adaptation ever made.Roger Ebertsaid it, alongsideIron Man, had redefined the potential of superhero films by combining comic-book tropes with real world events.[ai]Some appreciated its complex moral tale about the effects of vigilantism and terrorism on contemporary society.Emanuel LevyandManohla Dargispraised the depiction of the characters as possessing both positive and negative aspects, such as Batman's efforts to end crime provoking unintended consequences and a greater response from criminals; Dargis believedThe Dark Knight's exploration of chaos, fear, and death, following theSeptember 11 attacksin 2001, represented ""that American movies have entered a new era of ambivalence when it comes to their heroes or maybe just superness.""[aj]Others criticized the dark, grim, intense, and self-serious tone as lacking any elements of fun or fantasy.[ak]David DenbysaidThe Dark Knightwas a product of a ""time of terror"", but focused on embracing and unleashing it while cynically setting up a sequel.[211]Stephanie ZacharekandDavid Edelsteincriticized a perceived lack of visual storytelling in favor of exposition, and aspects of the plot being difficult to follow amid the fast pace and loud score.[233][234]Christopher's action direction was criticized, especially during fight scenes where it could be difficult to see things clearly,[228][229]although the prologue bank heist was praised as among the film's best.[al]Ledger's performance received near-unanimous praise with the caveat that his death made the role both highly anticipated and difficult to watch.[am]Dargis, among others, described Ledger as realizing the Joker so convincingly, intensely, and viscerally it made the audience forget about the actor behind the makeup.The Village Voicewrote the performance would have made Ledger a legend even if he had lived.[an]Other reviews said Ledger outshone Nicholson's performance with macabre humor and malevolence.[223][236][240]Reviews generally agreed the Joker was the best-written character, and that Ledger commanded scenes from the entire cast to create one of the most mesmerizing cinematic villains.[ao]Bale's reception was mixed; his performance was considered to be alternately ""captivating"" or serviceable, but ultimately uninteresting and undermined by portraying an immovable and generally unchanged character who delivers Batman's dialogue in a hoarse, unvarying tone.[ap]Eckhart's performance was generally well received; reviewers praised his portrayal of Dent as charismatic, and the character's subsequent transformation into a sad, bitter ""monster"", althoughVarietyconsidered his subplot the film's weakest.[aq]Stephen Huntersaid the Dent character was underwritten and that Eckhart was incapable of portraying the role as intended.[235]Several reviewers regarded Gyllenhaal as an improvement over Holmes, although others said they found difficulty caring about the character and that Gyllenhaal, while more talented than her predecessor, was miscast.[ar]Peter Traverspraised Oldman's skill in making a virtuous character interesting and he, among others, described Caine's and Freeman's performances as ""effortless"".[221][224][234]Ebert surmised the entire cast provided ""powerful"" performances that engage the audience, such that ""we're surprised how deeply the drama affects us"".[211]AccoladesMain article:List of accolades received byThe Dark KnightHeath Ledger(2006) received theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor, making him only the second actor to win a posthumousAcademy Award.The Dark Knightappeared on several lists recognizing the best films of 2008, including those compiled by Ebert,The Hollywood Reporter, and theAmerican Film Institute.[as]At the13th Satellite Awards,The Dark Knightreceived one award for Sound Editing or Mixing (Richard King,Lora Hirschberg,Gary Rizzo).[250]A further four wins came at the35th People's Choice Awards: Favorite Movie, Favorite Cast, Favorite Action Movie, and Favorite On-Screen Match-Up (Bale and Ledger),[251]as well as Best Action Movie and Best Supporting Actor (Ledger) at the14th Critics' Choice Awards.[252]Howard and Zimmer were recognized for Best Motion Picture Score at the51st Annual Grammy Awards.[253]Ledger won the film's only awards at the15th Screen Actors Guild Awards,62nd British Academy Film Awards, and66th Golden Globe Awards, for Best Supporting Actor.[254][255][256]At the14th Empire Awards,The Dark Knightreceived awards forBest Film,Best Director(Christopher Nolan), andBest Actor(Bale).[257]Ledger received the award forBest Villainat the2009 MTV Movie Awards,[258]and at the35th Saturn Awards,The Dark Knightwon awards forBest Action or Adventure Film,Best Supporting Actor(Ledger),Best Writing(Christopher and Jonathan Nolan),Best Music(Howard and Zimmer), andBest Special Effects(Corbould,Nick Davis,Paul J. Franklin,Timothy Webber).[259]BeforeThe Dark Knight's release, film industry discourse focused on Ledger potentially earning an Academy Award nomination at the 81st Academy Awards in 2009, making him only the seventh person to be nominated posthumously, and if the decision would be influenced by his death or performance.[at]Genre films such as those based on comic books were also generally ignored by Academy voters.[268][269][270]Even so, Ledger was considered a favorite to earn the award based on praise from critic groups and his posthumous Golden Globe award.[262][263][264]Ledger won theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor, making him only the second performer to win an award posthumously (afterPeter Finchin 1977), andThe Dark Knightthe first comic book adaptation to win an academy acting award.[262][271][272]The Dark Knightalso won an award forBest Sound Editing(King), and received six nominations forBest Art Direction(Crowley andPeter Lando),Best Cinematography(Pfister),Best Film Editing(Smith),Best Makeup(Caglione Jr. and O'Sullivan),Best Sound Mixing(Hirschberg, Rizzo, andEd Novick), andBest Visual Effects(Davis, Corbould, Webber, and Franklin).[273]Despite the success ofThe Dark Knight, the lack of aBest Picturenomination was criticized and described as a ""snub"" by some publications. The response was seen as the culmination of several years of criticism toward the academy ignoring high-performing, broadly popular films.[274][275][276]The backlash was such that, for the82nd Academy Awardsin 2010, the academy increased the limit for Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as ""The Dark Knight Rule"". It allowed for more broadly popular but ""respected"" films to be nominated, includingDistrict 9,The Blind Side,Avatar, andUp, the first animated film to be nominated in two decades.[au]This change is seen as responsible for the first Best Picture nomination of a comic book adaptation,Black Panther(2018).[277][285]Even so,The Hollywood Reporterargued the academy mistook the appeals to recognize important, ""generation-defining"" genre films with just nominating more films.[286]Other releasesHome mediaThe Dark Knightwas released onDVDandBlu-rayin December 2008.

The film was released at the beginning of the Blu-ray disc format; it was considered a success, breakingIron Man's record of 250,000 units sold and indicating the format was growing in popularity.[aw]In 2011, it also became the first major-studio film to be released for rent via digital distribution onFacebook.[295]A4K resolutionremaster, which was overseen by Christopher, was released in December 2017 as a set containing a 4KUltra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray disc, and digital download, as well as special features from earlier releases.[296][297][298]Merchandise and spin-offsThe entrance toThe Dark Knight CoasteratSix Flags Great AdventureinJackson Township, New JerseyMerchandise forThe Dark Knightincludes statuettes, action figures, radio-controlled Tumbler and Batpod models, costumes, sets of Batarangs, a limited-edition Grappling Launcher replica, board games, puzzles, clothing, and a special-editionUNOcard game.[ax]A novelization written byDennis O'Neilwas released in 2008.[303]Adirect-to-DVDanimated film,Batman: Gotham Knight, was released in July 2008. Executive produced byBruce Timmand Nolan's wife Emma Thomas, with Goyer as one of the writers, it includes veteran Batman voice actorKevin Conroyreprising his role. Originally there was interest in bringing Bale and other actors from the live-action films to voice their respective characters, but it was not possible due to scheduling conflicts.Gotham Knightpresents six vignettes, each of which are animated in a different artistic style, set between the events ofBatman BeginsandThe Dark Knight.[304][305]A video game adaptation,Batman: The Dark Knight, was canceled due to development problems.[306][307]The Dark Knight Coaster, an indoor roller coaster, opened in May 2008 atSix Flags Great AdventureinJackson Township, New Jersey. Costing $7.5million, the 1,213-foot (370 m) long attraction places riders in an imitation of Wayne Central Station in Gotham City as they move through areas that are vandalized or controlled by the Joker.[308][309]Themes and analysisTerrorism and escalationA central theme ofThe Dark Knightis escalation, particularly the rise of the Joker in response to Batman's vigilantism.[310][311]Batman's vigilante operation arms him with high-tech military equipment against common criminals, and the Joker is the inevitable response and escalation of lawlessness to counter Batman. Critic Siddhant Adlakha argued that the Joker symbolizes the constructed, unknowable face of modern terrorism. While real-world terrorism often has identifiable political motives,such asAl-Qaedaciting U.S. actions inSomaliaandLebanon, orISISemerging from theIraqoccupation, the Joker's chaos reflects how terror can appear cyclical and inseparable from the militarism it reacts against.[311]Batman also inspires copycat vigilantes, further escalating lawlessness.Film studiesprofessor Todd McGowan said Batman asserts authority over these copycats, telling them to stop because they do not have the same defensive equipment as himself, reaffirming his self-given authority to act as a vigilante.[312]The film has been analyzed as an analog for the war on terror, the militaristic campaign the U.S. launched following the September 11 attacks.[311]The scene in which Batman stands in the ruins of a destroyed building, having failed to prevent the Joker's plot, is reminiscent of theWorld Trade Center siteafter September 11.[311]According to historianStephen Prince,The Dark Knightis about the consequences of civil and government authorities abandoning rules in the fight against terrorism.[313]Several publications criticizedThe Dark Knightfor a perceived endorsement of ""necessary evils"" such as torture andrendition.[314]AuthorAndrew Klavansaid Batman is a stand-in for then-U.S. presidentGeorge W. Bushand justified the breaching of ""boundaries of civil rights to deal with an emergency, certain that [Batman] will re-establish those boundaries when the emergency is past"".[312][315]Klavan's interpretation was criticized by some publications that consideredThe Dark Knightanti-war, proposing society must not abandon the rule of law to combat lawlessness or risk creating the conditions for escalation.[316][317]This is exemplified in the covert alliance formed between Batman, Dent, and Gordon, leading to Rachel's death and Dent's corruption.[314]Writer Benjamin Kerstein said both viewpoints are valid, and that ""The Dark Knightis a perfect mirror of the society which is watching it: a society so divided on the issues of terror and how to fight it that, for the first time in decades, an American mainstream no longer exists"".[318]Batman and Dent resort to torture orenhanced interrogationto stop the Joker but he remains immune to their efforts because he has a strong belief in his goals. When Dent ineffectually attempts to torture Joker's henchman, Batman does not condemn the act, only being concerned about public perception if people discover the truth. This conveys the protagonists' gradual abandonment of their principles when faced with an extreme foe.[311]The Joker meets Dent in a hospital to explain how expected atrocities, such as the deaths of several soldiers, and societal failings are tolerated but when norms are unexpectedly disrupted, people panic and descend into chaos.[311][319]Although the Joker wears disguising makeup, he is not hiding behind a mask and is the same person with or without makeup. He lacks any identity or origin, representing the uncertainty, unknowability, and fear of terrorism, although he does not follow any political ideology.[311][320]Dent represents the fulfillment of American idealism, a noble person who can work within the confines of the law and allow Batman to retire, but the fear and chaos embodied by the Joker taints that idealism and corrupts Dent absolutely.[311]InThe Dark Knight's final act, Batman employs an invasive surveillance network by co-opting the phones of Gotham's citizens to locate the Joker, violating their privacy. Adlakha described this act as a ""militaristic fantasy"", in which a significant violation of civil liberties is required through the means of advanced technology to capture a dangerous terrorist, reminiscent of the2001 Patriot Act. Lucius Fox threatens to stop helping Batman in response, believing he has crossed an ethical boundary, and although Batman agrees these violations are unacceptable and destroys the technology, the film demonstrates he could not have stopped the Joker in time without it.[311][312]Morality and ethicsThe Dark Knightfocuses on the moral and ethical battles faced by the central characters, and the compromises they make to defeat the Joker under extraordinary circumstances.[ay]Roger Ebert said the Joker forces impossible ethical decisions on each character to test the limits of their morality.[221][311]Batman represents order to the Joker's chaos and is brought to his own limit but avoids completely compromising himself. Dent represents goodness and hope; he is the city's ""white knight"" who is ""pure"" of intent and can operate within the law.[311][312][319]Dent is motivated to do good because he identifies himself as good, not through trauma like Batman, and has faith in the legal system.[312]Adlakha wrote Dent is framed as a religious icon, his campaign slogan being ""I believe in Harvey Dent"", and his eventual death leaves his arms spread wide likeJesus on the Cross.[311][319]Eckhart described Dent as someone who loves the law but feels constrained by it and his inability to do what he believes is right because the rules he must follow do not allow it.[65]Dent's desire to work outside the law is seen in his support of Batman's vigilantism to accomplish what he cannot.[41]Dent's corruption suggests he is a proxy for those looking for hope because he is as fallible and susceptible to darkness as anyone else.[319]This can be seen in his use of a two-headed coin to make decisions involving others, eliminating the risk of chance by controlling the outcome in his favor, indicating losing is not an acceptable outcome for him. Once Dent experiences a significant traumatic event in the loss of Rachel and his own disfigurement, he quickly abandons his noble former self to seek his own form of justice. His coin is scarred on one side, introducing the risk of chance, and he submits himself to it completely. According to English professor Daniel Boscaljon, Dent is not broken; he believes in a different form of justice in a seemingly unjust world, flipping a coin because it is ""Unbiased. Unprejudiced. Fair.""[322]The Joker represents an ideological deviancy; he does not seek personal gain and causes chaos for its own sake, setting a towering pile of cash ablaze to prove ""everything burns"". Unlike Batman, the Joker is the same with or without makeup, having no identity to conceal and nothing to lose.[az]Boscaljon wrote the residents and criminals believe in a form of order and rules that must be obeyed; the Joker deliberately upends this belief because he has no rules or limitations.[324]The character can be considered an example ofFriedrich Nietzsche's ""Superman"", who exists outside definitions such as good and evil, and follows his own indomitable will. The film, however, leaves open the option to dismiss his insights because his chaos ultimately leads to death and injustice.[325]Christopher described the Joker as an unadulterated evil, and professor Charles Bellinger considered him a satanic figure who repels people from goodness and tempts them with things they supposedly lack, such as forcing Batman to choose between saving Dent—who is best for the city—and Rachel, who is best for Wayne.[326]The Joker aims to corrupt Dent to prove anyone, even symbols, can be broken. In their desperation, Dent and Batman are forced to question their own limitations. As the Joker states to Batman:Their morals, their code ... it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see—I'll show you ... when the chips are down, these civilized people ... they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster ... I'm just ahead of the curve.—The Joker, inThe Dark Knight[327]The ferry scene can be seen as the Joker's true defeat, demonstrating he is wrong about the residents turning on each other in an extreme scenario.[311][319]According to writer David Chen, this demonstrates, individually, people cannot responsibly handle power but by sharing the responsibility, there is hope for a compassionate outcome.[319]Although Batman holds to his morals and does not kill the Joker, he is forced to break his code by pushing Dent to his death to save an innocent person. Batman chooses to become a symbol of criminality by taking the blame for Dent's crimes and preserving him as a symbol of good, maintaining the hope of Gotham's residents.[311][312][319]Critic David Crow wrote Batman's true test is not defeating the Joker but saving Dent, a task at which he fails.[328]Batman makes his own Christ-like sacrifice, taking on Dent's sins to preserve the city.[325]AlthoughThe Dark Knightpresents this as a heroic act, this ""noble lie"" is used to conceal and manipulate the truth for what a minority determines is the greater good.[312][329]McGowan considered the act heroic because Batman's sacrifice will leave him hunted and despised without recognition, indicating he has learned from the Joker the established norms must sometimes be broken.[312]According to professor Martin Fradley, among others, Batman's ""noble lie"" and Gordon's support of it is a cynical endorsement of deception and totalitarianism.[312][329]Wayne's butler Alfred also commits a noble lie, concealing Rachel's choice of Dent over Wayne to spare him the pain of her rejection.[311]LegacyCultural influenceThe Dark Knightis considered an influential and often-imitated work that redefined the superhero/comic-book film genre, and filmmaking in general.[ba]In 2020, the United StatesLibrary of CongressselectedThe Dark Knightto be preserved in theNational Film Registryfor being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[332]BeforeThe Dark Knight, superhero films closely emulated their comic-book source material, and though the genre had seen significant successes such asSuperman(1978),Batman(1989),X-Men(2000), andSpider-Man(2002), they were often considered disposable entertainment that did not garner much industry respect.[bb]A 2018 retrospective byThe Hollywood ReportersaidThe Dark Knighttaught filmmakers ""comic book characters are malleable. They are able to be grounded or fantastic, able to be prestigious or pure blockbuster entertainment, to be dark and gritty or light, to be character-driven or action-packed, or any variation in-between.""[286]The Dark Knightis considered a blueprint for the modern superhero film that productions either attempt to closely emulate or deliberately counter.[bc]Its financial, critical, and cultural successes legitimized the genre with film studios at a time when recent films, such asDaredevil,Hulk(both 2003),Fantastic Four(2005), andSuperman Returns(2006) had failed to meet expectations.[276][334]The genre became a focus of annual studio strategies rather than a relatively niche project, and a surge of comic-book adaptations followed, in part because of their broad franchising potential. In 2008, Ebert wrote; ""[The Dark Knight], and to a lesser degreeIron Man, redefine the possibilities of the 'comic-book movie'"".[211]The AtlanticwroteIron Man's legacy in launching theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU) could not have happened without the financial and critical success ofThe Dark Knight, which made comic book adaptations a central focus of film studios.[185][276][286]Retrospective analysis has focused on the way studios, eager to replicate its performance, released tonally dark, gritty, and realistic films, or reboots of existing franchises, many of which failed critically or commercially.[278][286][330]Some publications said studios took the wrong lessons fromThe Dark Knight, treating source material too seriously and mistaking a dark, gritty tone for narrative depth and intelligent writing.[bd]The MCU is seen as a successful continuation of what madeThe Dark Knighta success, combining genres and tones relevant to each respective film while treating the source material seriously, unlike theDC Extended Universe, which more closely emulated the tone ofThe Dark Knightbut failed to replicate its success.[330][336]Directors includingSam Mendes(Skyfall, 2012),Ryan Coogler(Black Panther), andDavid Ayer(Suicide Squad, 2016), have cited it as an influence on their work,Steven Spielberglisted it among his favorite films, andTimothée Chalametsaid it inspired him to become an actor.[be]The film has been referenced in a variety of media including television shows such asRobot Chicken,South Park, andThe Simpsons.[341][342][343]U.S. PresidentBarack Obamaused Joker to explain the growth ofIslamic State(IS) military group, saying ""... the gang leaders of Gotham are meeting... they were thugs, but there was a kind of order... the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire. [IS] is the Joker.""[344]Joker's appearance became a popular Halloween costume and also influenced the 2009Barack Obama ""Joker"" poster.[bf]Retrospective assessmentsSince its release,The Dark Knighthas been assessed as one of the greatest superhero films ever made,[bg]among thegreatest films ever made,[bh]and one of the best sequel films.[bi]It is also considered among the best films of the 2000s,[bj]and in a 2010 poll of thirty-seven critics by Metacritic regarding the decade's top films,The Dark Knightreceived the eighth most mentions, appearing on 7 lists.[375]In the 2010s, a poll of 177 film critics by theBBCin 2016 listed it as the 33rd-best film of the 21st century,[376]andThe Guardianplaced it 98th on its own list.[377]In 2020,Empiremagazine named it third-best, behindThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring(2001) andMad Max: Fury Road(2015).[378]As of 2023[update], it remains the highest critically rated Batman film according to Rotten Tomatoes, and is often ranked as the best film featuring the character.[bk]The Dark Knightremains popular with entertainment industry professionals, including directors, actors, critics, and stunt actors, being ranked 57th onThe Hollywood Reporter's poll of the best films ever made,[359]18th onTime Out's list of the best action films,[389]and 96th on the BBC's list of the 100 Greatest American Films.[360]The Dark Knightis included in the film-reference book1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die,[390]and film criticsJames BerardinelliandBarry Normanincluded it in their individual listings of the 100 greatest films of all time.[361][362]In 2012,Total Filmnamed it the sixth-most-accomplished film of the preceding fifteen years, and a 2020 article byEmpirenamedThe Dark Knightas one of the films that defined the previous three decades.[391][392]In 2020,Time Outnamed it the seventy-second-best action movie ever made.[393]In 2025, the film ranked number 28 onThe New York Times'list of ""The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century.""[394]Ledger's Joker is considered one of the greatest cinematic villains; several publications placed his portrayal second only to Darth Vader.[bl]In 2017,The Hollywood Reporternamed Ledger's Joker the second-best cinematic superhero performance ever, behindHugh JackmanasWolverine,[400]andColliderlisted him as the greatest villain of the 21st century.[401]In 2022,Varietylisted him as the best superhero film performance of the preceding 50 years (Eckhart appears at number 22).[402]Entertainment Weeklywrote there had not been another villain as interesting or ""perversely entertaining"" as Joker, and Ledger's performance was considered so defining that future interpretations would be compared against it.Michael B. Jordancited the character as an inspiration for his characterErik KillmongerinBlack Panther.[bm]The ""pencil trick"" scene, in which Joker makes a pencil disappear by slamming a mobster's head on it, is considered an iconic scene and among the film's most famous.[bn]Similarly, the character's line ""why so serious?"" is among the film's most famous and oft-quoted pieces of dialog,[bo]alongside""everyone loses their minds,"" andDent's line ""you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain"", as well asPennyworth's line ""some men just want to watch the world burn""; the lines also became popularinternet memes.[bp]The Dark Knightremains popular with audiences in publicly voted rankings.

For other uses, seeFight Club (disambiguation).Fight ClubTheatrical release posterDirected byDavid FincherScreenplay byJim UhlsBased onFight ClubbyChuck PalahniukProduced byArt LinsonCeán ChaffinRoss Grayson BellStarringBrad PittEdward NortonHelena Bonham CarterMeat Loaf AdayJared LetoCinematographyJeff CronenwethEdited byJames HaygoodMusic byThe Dust BrothersProductioncompaniesFox 2000 PicturesRegency EnterprisesLinson FilmsDistributed by20th Century FoxRelease datesSeptember 10, 1999(1999-09-10)(Venice)October 15, 1999(1999-10-15)(United States)Running time139 minutes[1]CountryUnited States[nb 1]LanguageEnglishBudget$63–65 million[1][4]Box office$101 million[1]Fight Clubis a 1999 American film directed byDavid Fincherand starringBrad Pitt,Edward Norton, andHelena Bonham Carter. It is based on the 1996 novelFight ClubbyChuck Palahniuk. Norton playsthe unnamed narrator, who is discontented with hiswhite-collarjob. He forms a ""fight club"" with a soap salesman, Tyler Durden (Pitt), and becomes embroiled with an impoverished but beguiling woman, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter).Palahniuk's novel wasoptionedbyFox 2000 PicturesproducerLaura Ziskin, who hiredJim Uhlsto write the film adaptation. Fincher was selected because of his enthusiasm for the story. He developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. It was filmed in and aroundLos Angelesfrom July to December 1998. He and the cast compared the film toRebel Without a Cause(1955) andThe Graduate(1967), with a theme of conflict betweenGeneration Xand thevalue systemofadvertising.[5][6]Studio executives did not like the film and restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign to try to reduce anticipated losses.Fight Clubpremiered at the56th Venice International Film Festivalon September 10, 1999, and was released in the United States on
October 15, 1999, by20th Century Fox. The film failed to meet the studio's expectations at the box office and polarized critics. It was ranked as one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the1990s. However,Fight Clublater found commercial success with its home video release, establishing it as acult classicand causing media to revisit the film. In 2009, on its tenth anniversary,The New York Timesdubbed it the ""defining cult movie of our time.""[7]Plot[edit]The unnamed Narrator, who struggles with insomnia and dissatisfaction with his job and lifestyle, finds temporary solace in support groups. As his insomnia worsens, he discovers that expressions of emotional vulnerability help him sleep, leading him to join multiple groups for people facing emotionally distressing problems, despite his expressions being fraudulent. His efforts are thwarted when Marla Singer, another impostor, joins the same groups. The Narrator cannot present his fabricated struggles as genuine, or divert his attention from her presence as an impostor, causing his sleeplessness to return. He arranges for them to attend different sessions to regain his ability to sleep and, under certain circumstances, to exchange contact information, to which she reluctantly agrees.On a return flight from work, the Narrator meets a soap salesman, Tyler Durden. After an explosion destroys the Narrator's apartment, he moves into Tyler's decrepit house. They become friends and start an underground fight club in a bar basement. Tyler also saves Marla from an overdose, initiating a sexual relationship between them, while the Narrator remains cold to her.The Narrator quits his job, blackmails his boss for funds, and grows the fight club, attracting new members, including his cancer support group friend, Bob. Tyler morphs the club into Project Mayhem, committing vandalism to disrupt the social order. Feeling sidelined, the Narrator confronts Tyler, who admits to orchestrating the explosion in the Narrator's apartment and then goes missing. Bob is killed by the police during a mission, prompting the Narrator to attempt to stop the project and look for Tyler. Discovering the project's nationwide reach and being called Tyler Durden by Marla and other people, he realizes he and Tyler aresplit personalities.Learning that Project Mayhem plans to erase debt records by blowing up the headquarters of credit-card companies, the Narrator unsuccessfully warns Marla and goes to the police, some of whom are also Project Mayhem members. He attempts to disarm the explosives, but Tyler attacks him. The Narrator shoots himself in the mouth, killing Tyler. Marla arrives and she and the Narrator hold hands as they watch the targeted buildings collapse.Cast[edit]Edward Norton(left) in 2009 andBrad Pitt(right) in 2019Brad Pittas Tyler Durden, alter ego of the narratorEdward Nortonasthe Narrator.

There's nothing to kill anymore, there's nothing to fight, nothing to overcome, nothing to explore. In that societal emasculation this everyman [the Narrator] is created.—David Fincher[8]Fincher saidFight Clubwas acoming of agefilm, like the 1967 filmThe Graduatebut for people in their 30s. Fincher described the narrator as an ""everyman"";[8]the character is identified in the script as ""Jack"", but left unnamed in the film.[9]Fincher outlined the Narrator's background, ""He's tried to do everything he was taught to do, tried to fit into the world by becoming the thing he isn't."" He cannot find happiness, so he travels on a path to enlightenment in which he must ""kill"" his parents, god, and teacher. By the start of the film, he has ""killed off"" his parents. With Tyler Durden, he kills his god by doing things they are not supposed to do. To complete the process of maturing, the Narrator has to kill his teacher, Tyler Durden.[10]The character is a 1990s inverse of theGraduatearchetype: ""a guy who doesnothave a world of possibilities in front of him, he hasnopossibilities, he literally cannot imagine a way to change his life."" He is confused and angry, so he responds to his environment by creating Tyler Durden, aNietzscheanÜbermensch, in his mind. While Tyler is who the Narrator wants to be, he is not empathetic and does not help the Narrator face decisions in his life ""that are complicated and have moral and ethical implications"". Fincher explained, ""[Tyler] can deal with the concepts of our lives in an idealistic fashion, but it doesn't have anything to do with the compromises of real life as modern man knows it. Which is: you're not really necessary to a lot of what's going on. It's built, it just needs to run now.""[8]While studio executives worried thatFight Clubwas going to be ""sinister and seditious"", Fincher sought to make it ""funny and seditious"" by including humor to temper the sinister element.[11]ScreenwriterJim Uhlsdescribed the film as aromantic comedy, explaining, ""It has to do with the characters' attitudes toward a healthy relationship, which is a lot of behavior whichseemsunhealthy and harsh to each other, but in fact does work for them—because both characters are out on the edge psychologically.""[12]The Narrator seeks intimacy, but avoids it with Marla Singer, seeing too much of himself in her.[13]While Marla is a seductive and negativist prospect for the Narrator, he embraces the novelty and excitement that comes with befriending Tyler. The Narrator is comfortable being personally connected to Tyler, but becomes jealous when Tyler becomes sexually involved with Marla. When the Narrator argues with Tyler about their friendship, Tyler tells him that being friends is secondary to pursuing the philosophy they have been exploring.[14]When Tyler implies that Marla is a risk they should remove, the Narrator realizes he should have focused on her and begins to diverge from Tyler's path.[13]We decided early on that I would start to starve myself as the film went on, while [Brad Pitt] would lift and go to tanning beds; he would become more and more idealized as I wasted away.—Edward Norton[15]The Narrator, anunreliable narrator, is not immediately aware that he is mentally projecting Tyler.[16]He also mistakenly promotes the fight clubs as a way to feel powerful,[17]though the Narrator's physical condition worsens while Tyler Durden's appearance improves. While Tyler desires ""real experiences"" of actual fights like the Narrator at first,[18]he manifests anihilisticattitude of rejecting and destroying institutions and value systems.[19]His impulsive nature, representing theid,[13]is seductive and liberating to the Narrator and the members of Project Mayhem. Tyler's initiatives and methods become dehumanizing;[19]he orders around the members of Project Mayhem with a megaphone similar to camp directors at Chinesere-educationcamps.[13]The Narrator pulls back from Tyler and arrives at a middle ground between his conflicting selves.[14]Fight ClubexaminesGeneration Xangst as ""the middle children of history"".[6]Norton said it examines the value conflicts of Generation X as the first generation raised on television: this generation had ""its value system largely dictated to it by advertising culture"", and was told one could achieve ""spiritual happiness through home furnishing"".[5][18]His character walks through his apartment while visual effects identify his manyIKEApossessions. Fincher described the Narrator's immersion, ""It was just the idea of living in this fraudulent idea of happiness.""[20]Pitt said, ""Fight Clubis a metaphor for the need to push through the walls we put around ourselves and just go for it, so for the first time we can experience the pain.""[21]Fight Clubalso parallels the 1955 filmRebel Without a Cause; both probe the frustrations of the people in the system.[18]The characters, having undergone societalemasculation, are reduced to ""a generation of spectators"".[22]A culture of advertising defines society's ""external signifiers of happiness"", causing an unnecessary chase for material goods that replaces the more essential pursuit of spiritual happiness. The film references consumer products such asGucci,Calvin Klein, and theVolkswagen New Beetle. Norton said of the Beetle, ""We smash it ... because it seemed like the classic example of aBaby Boomergeneration marketing plan that sold culture back to us.""[23]Pitt explained the dissonance, ""I think there's a self-defense mechanism that keeps my generation from having any real honest connection or commitment with our true feelings. We're rooting for ball teams, but we're not getting in there to play. We're so concerned with failure and success—like these two things are all that's going to sum you up at the end.""[21]The violence of the fight clubs serves not to promote or glorify combat, but for participants to experience feeling in a society where they are otherwise numb.[24]The fights represent a resistance to the impulse to be ""cocooned"" in society.[22]Norton believed the fighting strips away the ""fear of pain"" and ""the reliance on material signifiers of their self-worth"", leaving them to experience something valuable.[18]When the fights evolve into revolutionary violence, the film only half-accepts the revolutionarydialecticby Tyler Durden; the Narrator pulls back and rejects Durden's ideas.[14]Fight Clubpurposely shapes an ambiguous message whose interpretation is left to the audience.[19]Fincher said, ""I love this idea that you can havefascismwithout offering any direction or solution. Isn't the point of fascism to say, 'This is the way we should be going'? But this movie couldn't be further from offeringanykind of solution.""[11]Production[edit]Development[edit]The novelFight ClubbyChuck Palahniukwas published in 1996. Before its publication, aFox Searchlight Picturesbook scout sent agalley proofof the novel to creative executive Kevin McCormick. The executive assigned a studio reader to review the proof as a candidate for a film adaptation, but the reader discouraged it. McCormick then forwarded the proof to producersLawrence BenderandArt Linson, who also rejected it. Producers Josh Donen and Ross Bell saw potential and expressed interest. They arranged unpaid screen readings with actors to determine the script's length, and an initial reading lasted six hours. The producers cut out sections to reduce the running time, and they used the shorter script to record its dialogue. Bell sent the recording toLaura Ziskin, head of the divisionFox 2000 Pictures, who listened to the tape and purchased the rights toFight Clubfrom Palahniuk for $10,000.[25]Ziskin initially considered hiringBuck Henryto write the adaptation, findingFight Clubsimilar to the 1967 filmThe Graduate, which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He consideredPeter Jacksonthe best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 filmThe Frightenersin New Zealand.Bryan Singerreceived the book but did not read it.Danny Boylemet with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. The book was also sent toDavid O. Russell, but he couldn't understand it.[26]David Fincher, who had readFight Cluband had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with20th Century Foxat first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 filmAlien 3for Fox. To repair his relationship with Fox, he met with Ziskin and studio headBill Mechanic.[25]In August 1997, Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation ofFight Club.[27]Casting[edit]Producer Ross Bell met with actorRussell Croweto discuss his candidacy for the role of Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so the studio sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe.[25]Pitt was looking for a new film after the domestic failure of his 1998 filmMeet Joe Black, and the studio believedFight Clubwould be more commercially successful with a major star. The studio signed Pitt for US$17.5 million.[28]For the role of the unnamed Narrator, the studio desired a ""sexier marquee name"" such asMatt Damonto increase the film's commercial prospects; it also consideredSean Penn. Fincher instead considered Norton based on his performance in the 1996 filmThe People vs. Larry Flynt.[29]Other studios were approaching Norton for leading roles in developing films likeThe Talented Mr. RipleyandMan on the Moon. He was cast inRunaway Jury, but the film did not reach production. 20th Century Fox offered Norton $2.5 million forFight Club. He could not accept the offer immediately because he still owedParamount Picturesa film; he had signed a contractual obligation with Paramount to appear in one of the studio's future films for a smaller salary. Norton later satisfied the obligation with his role in the 2003 filmThe Italian Job.[28]In January 1998, 20th Century Fox announced that Pitt and Norton had been cast.[30]The actors prepared by taking lessons inboxing,taekwondo,grappling,[31]andsoapmaking.[32]Pitt voluntarily visited a dentist to have pieces of his front teeth chipped off so his character would not have perfect teeth. The pieces were restored after filming concluded.[33]Fincher's first choice for the role of Marla Singer wasJaneane Garofalo. While Fincher initially stated that she turned it down because she objected to the film's sexual content, in an interview in 2020, Garofalo revealed that she did accept the role, but was dropped because Norton believed she was poorly suited to it.[34][35]Fincher pitched the role toJulia Louis-Dreyfus.[36]The filmmakers consideredCourtney LoveandWinona Ryderas early candidates.[37]Love claimed that she was cast as Marla Singer, but was fired after she rejected Pitt's pitch for a film about her late husband,Kurt Cobain.[38]The studio wanted to castReese Witherspoon, but Fincher felt she was too young.[28]Sarah Michelle Gellarturned it down due to scheduling conflicts withBuffy The Vampire Slayer.[39]Finally, Fincher chose to cast Bonham Carter based on her performance in the 1997 filmThe Wings of the Dove.[40]Writing[edit]When Uhls first encountered the novel, it was in the form of a manuscript, though it already had a publisher. In his interview he stated that he read it just for enjoyment and was blown away by it.[41]He started working on a draft of the adapted screenplay, which excluded avoice-overbecause the industry perceived the technique as ""hackneyed and trite"" at the time. When Fincher joined the film, he thought that the film should have a voice-over, believing that the film's humor came from the Narrator's voice.[28]He described the film without a voice-over as seemingly ""sad and pathetic"".[42]Fincher and Uhls revised the script for six to seven months and by 1997 had a third draft that reordered the story and left out several major elements. When Pitt was cast, he was concerned that his character, Tyler Durden, was too one-dimensional. Fincher sought the advice of writer-directorCameron Crowe, who suggested giving the character more ambiguity. Fincher also hired screenwriterAndrew Kevin Walkerfor assistance. He invited Pitt and Norton to help revise the script, and the group drafted five revisions in the course of a year.[28]Palahniuk praised the faithful film adaptation of his novel and applauded how the film's plot was more streamlined than the book's. Palahniuk recalled how the writers debated if film audiences would believe the plot twist from the novel. Fincher supported including the twist, arguing, ""If they accept everything up to this point, they'll accept the plot twist. If they're still in the theater, they'll stay with it.""[43]Palahniuk's novel also containedhomoeroticovertones, which Fincher included in the film to make audiences uncomfortable and accentuate the surprise of the twists.[44]The bathroom scene where Tyler Durden bathes next to the Narrator is an example of the overtones; the line, ""I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need,"" was meant to suggest personal responsibility rather than homosexuality.[13]Another example is the scene at the beginning of the film in which Tyler Durden puts a gun barrel down the Narrator's mouth.[45]The Narrator finds redemption at the end of the film by rejecting Tyler Durden's dialectic, a path that diverged from the novel's ending in which the Narrator is placed in a mental institution.[11]Norton drew parallels between redemption in the film and redemption inThe Graduate, indicating that the protagonists of both films find a middle ground between two divisions of self.[14]Fincher considered the novel too infatuated with Tyler Durden and changed the ending to move away from him, ""I wanted people to love Tyler, but I also wanted them to be OK with his vanquishing.""[11]Filming[edit]Studio executives Mechanic and Ziskin planned an initial budget of $23 million to finance the film,[25]but by the start of production, the budget was increased to $50 million. Half was paid byNew Regency, but during filming, the projected budget escalated to $67 million. New Regency's head andFight Clubexecutive producerArnon Milchanpetitioned Fincher to reduce costs by at least $5 million. Fincher refused, so Milchan threatened Mechanic that New Regency would withdraw financing. Mechanic sought to restore Milchan's support by sending him tapes ofdailiesfromFight Club. After seeing three weeks of filming, Milchan reinstated New Regency's financial backing.[46]The final production budget was $63–65 million.[1][4]Thefight sceneswere heavily choreographed, but the actors were required to ""go full out"" to capture realistic effects such as having the wind knocked out of them.[21]Makeup artist Julie Pearce, who had worked for Fincher on the 1997 filmThe Game, studiedmixed martial artsandpay-per-viewboxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, inspired bythe boxing matchin whichMike Tysonbit off part ofEvander Holyfield's ear.[47]Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat ofVaseline, and using the unadulterated water for ""wet sweat"".Meat Loaf, who plays a fight club member who has ""bitch tits"", wore a 90-pound (40 kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts.[31]He also wore eight-inch (20 cm)liftsin his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.[13]Filming lasted 138 days from July to December 1998,[48]during which Fincher shot more than 1,500 rolls of film, three times the average for a Hollywood film.[31]The locations were in and aroundLos Angelesand on sets built at the studio inCentury City.[48]Production designerAlex McDowellconstructed more than 70 sets.[31]The exterior of Tyler Durden's house was built inWilmington, California,[49]while the interior was built on a sound stage at the studio's location. The interior was given a decayed look to illustrate the deconstructed world of the characters.[48]Marla Singer's apartment was based on photographs of apartments in downtown LA.[16]Overall, production included 300 scenes, 200 locations, andcomplex special effects. Fincher comparedFight Clubto his subsequent, less complex filmPanic Room, ""I felt like I was spending all my time watching trucks being loaded and unloaded so I could shoot three lines of dialogue. There was far too much transportation going on.""[50]Cinematography[edit]Fincher used theSuper 35format to filmFight Clubsince it gave him maximum flexibility to compose shots. He hiredJeff Cronenwethas cinematographer; Cronenweth's fatherJordan Cronenwethhad been cinematographer for Fincher's 1992 filmAlien 3,but left midway through production due toParkinson's disease. Fincher explored visual styles in his previous filmsSevenandThe Game, and he and Cronenweth drew elements from these styles forFight Club.[48]Fincher and Cronenweth applied a lurid style, choosing to make people ""sort of shiny"".[16]The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as ""more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense—a visual metaphor of what [the Narrator is] heading into"". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction.[48]Bonham Carter wore opalescent makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a ""smack-fiendpatina"". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 filmAmerican Graffiti, which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.[16]The crew took advantage of both natural and practical light. Fincher sought various approaches to the lighting setups; for example, he chose several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. The crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries.[48]On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographerGordon Willis' technique as the influence.[13]Fight Clubwas filmed mostly at night, and Fincher filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in the basement and instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera from the viewpoint of a distant observer to that of the fighter.[48]The scenes with Tyler were staged to conceal that the character was a mental projection of the unnamed Narrator. Tyler was not filmed intwo shotswith a group of people, nor was he shown in anyover-the-shoulder shotsin scenes where Tyler gives the Narrator specific ideas to manipulate him. In scenes before the Narrator meets Tyler, the filmmakers inserted Tyler's presence in single frames forsubliminal effect.[16]Tyler appears in the background and out of focus, like a ""little devil on the shoulder"".[13]Fincher explained the subliminal frames, ""Our hero is creating Tyler Durden in his own mind, so at this point he exists only on the periphery of the Narrator's consciousness.""[51]While Cronenweth generally rated and exposed the Kodakfilm stocknormally onFight Club, several other techniques were applied to change its appearance.Flashingwas implemented on much of the exterior night photography, thecontrastwas stretched to be purposely ugly, the print was adjusted to beunderexposed,Technicolor's ENRsilver retentionwas used on a select number of prints to increase thedensityof the blacks, and high-contrast print stocks were chosen to create a ""stepped-on"" look on the print with a dirty patina.[16]Visual effects[edit]Fincher hiredvisual effects supervisorKevin Tod Haug, who worked for him onThe Game, to create visual effects forFight Club. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, ""We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, we never had to play to a facility's weakness."" Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a ""mind's eye"" view and structured amyopicframework for the film audiences. Fincher also usedprevisualizedfootage of challenging main-unit and visual effects shots as a problem-solving tool to avoid making mistakes during the actual filming.[51]The opening scene inFight Clubthat represents a brain'sneural networkin which the thought processes are initiated by the Narrator's fear impulse. The network was mapped using anL-systemand drawn out by a medical illustrator.The film's title sequence is a 90-second visual effects composition that depicts the inside of the Narrator's brain at a microscopic level; the camera pulls back to the outside, starting at his fear center and following the thought processes initiated by his fear impulse.[52]The sequence, designed in part by Fincher, was budgeted separately from the rest of the film at first, but the sequence was awarded by the studio in January 1999.[51]Fincher hiredDigital Domainand its visual effects supervisorKevin Mack, who won anAcademy Award for Visual Effectsfor the 1998 filmWhat Dreams May Come, for the sequence. The company mapped the computer-generated brain using anL-system,[53]and the design was detailed using renderings by medical illustrator Katherine Jones. The pullback sequence from within the brain to the outside of the skull includedneurons,action potentials, and ahair follicle. Haug explained the artistic license that Fincher took with the shot, ""While he wanted to keep the brain passage looking likeelectron microscope photography, that look had to be coupled with the feel of a night dive—wet, scary, and with a low depth of field."" The shallowdepth of fieldwas accomplished with theray tracingprocess.[51]Other visual effects include an early scene in which the camera flashes past city streets to survey Project Mayhem's destructive equipment lying in underground parking lots; the sequence was a three-dimensional composition of nearly 100 photographs of Los Angeles and Century City by photographer Michael Douglas Middleton. The final scene of the demolition of the credit card office buildings was designed by Richard Baily of Image Savant; Baily worked on the scene for over fourteen months.[51]Midway through the film, Tyler Durden points out thecue mark—nicknamed ""cigarette burn"" in the film—to the audience. The scene represents a turning point that foreshadows the coming rupture and inversion of the ""fairly subjective reality"" that existed earlier in the film. Fincher explained, ""Suddenly it's as though the projectionist missed the changeover, the viewers have to start looking at the movie in a whole new way.""[51]Score[edit]Fincher was concerned that bands experienced in writingfilm scoreswould be unable to tie the themes together, so he sought a band which had never recorded for film. He pursuedRadiohead,[13]but the singer,Thom Yorke, declined as he was recovering from the stress of promoting their 1997 albumOK Computer.[54]Fincher instead commissioned thebreakbeatproducing duoDust Brothers, who created a post-modern score encompassing drum loops, electronic scratches, and computerized samples. Dust Brothers performerMichael Simpsonexplained the setup, ""Fincher wanted to break new ground with everything about the movie, and a nontraditional score helped achieve that.""[55]The climax and end credits feature the song ""Where Is My Mind?"" byPixies.[56]Release[edit]Marketing[edit]Filming concluded in December 1998, and Fincher edited the footage in early 1999 to prepareFight Clubfor a screening with senior executives. They did not receive the film positively and were concerned that there would not be an audience for the film.[57]Executive producer Art Linson, who supported the film, recalled the response, ""So many incidences ofFight Clubwere alarming, no group of executives could narrow them down.""[58]Nevertheless,Fight Clubwas originally slated to be released in July 1999,[59]but was later changed to August 6, 1999. The studio further delayed the film's release, this time to autumn, citing a crowded summer schedule and a hurried post-production process.[60]Outsiders attributed the delays to theColumbine High School massacreearlier in the year.[61]Marketing executives atFox Searchlight Picturesfaced difficulties in marketingFight Cluband at one point considered marketing it as anart film. They considered that the film was primarily geared toward male audiences because of its violence and believed that not even Pitt would attract female filmgoers. Research testing showed that the film appealed to teenagers. Fincher refused to let the posters and trailers focus on Pitt and encouraged the studio to hire the advertising firmWieden+Kennedyto devise a marketing plan. The firm proposed a bar of pink soap with the title ""Fight Club"" embossed on it as the film's main marketing image; the proposal was considered ""a bad joke"" by Fox executives. Fincher also released two early trailers in the form of fakepublic service announcementspresented by Pitt and Norton; the studio did not think the trailers marketed the film appropriately. Instead, the studio financed a $20 million large-scale campaign to provide a press junket, posters, billboards, and trailers for TV that highlighted the film's fight scenes. The studio advertisedFight Clubon cable duringWorld Wrestling Federationbroadcasts, which Fincher protested, believing that the placement created the wrong context for the film.[57]Linson believed that the ""ill-conceived one-dimensional"" marketing by marketing executive Robert Harper largely contributed toFight Club's lukewarm box office performance in the United States.[62]Theatrical run[edit]The studio heldFight Club's world premiere at the56th Venice International Film Festivalon September 10, 1999.[63][64]For the American theatrical release, the studio hired the National Research Group to test screen the film; the group predicted the film would gross betweenUS$13 millionandUS$15 millionin its opening weekend.[65]Fight Clubopened commercially in the United States and Canada on October 15, 1999, and earnedUS$11 millionin 1,963 theaters over the opening weekend.[1]The film ranked first at the weekend box office, beatingDouble JeopardyandThe Story of Us, a fellow weekend opener.[66]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""B−"" on an A+ to F scale.[67]The gender mix of audiences forFight Club, argued to be ""the ultimate anti-date flick"", was 61% male and 39% female; 58% of audiences were below the age of 21. Despite the film's top placement, its opening gross fell short of the studio's expectations.[68]Over thesecond weekend,Fight Clubdropped 42.6% in revenue, earningUS$6.3 million.[69]In its original theatrical run, the film grossedUS$37 millionin the United States and Canada, andUS$63.8 millionin other territories, for a worldwide total ofUS$100.9 million. (With subsequent re-releases, the film's worldwide gross increased to$101.2 million.)[1]The underwhelming North American performance ofFight Clubsoured the relationship between 20th Century Fox's studio head Bill Mechanic and media executiveRupert Murdoch, which contributed to Mechanic's resignation in June 2000.[70]TheBritish Board of Film ClassificationreviewedFight Clubfor its November 12, 1999 release in the United Kingdom and removed two scenes involving ""an indulgence in the excitement of beating a (defenseless) man's face into a pulp"". The board assigned the film an 18 certificate, limiting the release to adult-only audiences in the UK. The BBFC did not censor any further, considering and dismissing claims thatFight Clubcontained ""dangerously instructive information"" and could ""encourage anti-social (behavior)"". The board decided, ""The film as a whole is—quite clearly—critical and sharply parodic of the amateur fascism which in part it portrays. Its central theme of male machismo (and theanti-social behaviourthat flows from it) is emphatically rejected by the central character in the concluding reels.""[71]The scenes were restored in a two-disc DVD edition released in the UK in March 2007.[72]In February 2024, in advance of a theatrical re-release, the BBFC lowered the classification from 18 to 15.[73]Home media[edit]Fincher supervised the composition of theDVDpackaging and was one of the first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released on DVD on June 6, 2000, in both one and two-disc editions.[74]The movie disc included four commentary tracks,[75]while the bonus disc contained behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, theater safety PSAs, the promotional music video ""This is Your Life"", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies,storyboards, and publicity materials.[76]Fincher worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented Fincher's vision, ""The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it."" The studio developed the packaging for two months.[77]The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title ""Fight Club"" was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, ""We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside.""[77]Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design, ""From a retail standpoint, [the DVD case] has incredible shelf-presence.""[78]It was the first DVD release to feature theTHXOptimode.[79]Fight Clubwon the 2000Online Film Critics SocietyAwards for Best DVD, Best DVD Commentary, and Best DVD Special Features.[80]Entertainment Weeklyranked the film's two-disc edition in first place on its 2001 list of ""The 50 Essential DVDs"", giving top ratings to the DVD's content and technical picture-and-audio quality.[81]When the two-disc edition went out of print, the studio re-released it in 2004 because of fans' requests.[82]The film sold more than 6 million copies on DVD and video within the first ten years,[83]making it one of the largest-selling home media items in the studio's history,[62]in addition to grossing over $55 million in video and DVD rentals.[84]With a weak box office performance in the United States and Canada, a better performance in other territories, and the highly successful DVD release,Fight Clubgenerated a US$10 million profit for the studio.[62]The Laserdisc edition was only released in Japan on May 26, 2000[85]and features a different cover art, as well as one of the very fewDolby Digital Surround EXsoundtracks released on LD. The VHS edition was released on October 31, 2000, as a part of 20th Century Fox's ""Premiere Series"" line. It includes a featurette after the film, ""Behind the Brawl"".[86]Fight Clubwas released onBlu-rayin the United States on November 17, 2009.[87]Fivegraffitiartists were commissioned to create 30 pieces of art for the packaging, encompassing urban aesthetics found on theEast CoastandWest Coast of the United Statesas well as influences from Europeanstreet art.[88]The Blu-ray edition opens with a menu screen for the romantic comedyNever Been KissedstarringDrew Barrymorebefore leading into theFight Clubmenu screen. Fincher got permission from Barrymore to include the fake menu screen.[89]An online release in China fromTencentcensored the bomb blasts at the end and replaced the ending with a message that Project Mayhem was thwarted,[90]with Tyler Durden being arrested by law enforcement and placed in an insane asylum until 2012, adapting the ending of the originalFight Clubnovel.[91]Weeks later, Tencent released a version of the film restoring 11 of the 12 minutes that had previously been cut.[92][93]The novel's author Chuck Palahniuk believed the censored version partially restored the book's ending.[94][95]In October 2024, Fincher confirmed he would oversee a4Kremaster of the film.[96]Critical reception[edit]Cineaste's Gary Crowdus summarized the critical reception at the time, ""Many critics praisedFight Club, hailing it as one of the most exciting, original, and thought-provoking films of the year."" He wrote of the negative opinion, ""WhileFight Clubhad numerous critical champions, the film's critical attackers were far more vocal, a negative chorus which became hysterical about what they felt to be the excessively graphic scenes of fisticuffs ... They felt such scenes served only as a mindless glamorization of brutality, a morally irresponsible portrayal, which they feared might encourage impressionable young male viewers to set up their own real-life fight clubs in order to beat each other senseless.""[97]WhenFight Clubpremiered at the 56th Venice International Film Festival, the film was fiercely debated by critics. A newspaper reported, ""Many loved and hated it in equal measures."" Some critics expressed concern that the film would incitecopycat behavior, such as that seen afterA Clockwork Orangedebuted in Britain nearly three decades previously.[98]Upon the film's theatrical release,The Timesreported the reaction, ""It touched a nerve in the male psyche that was debated in newspapers across the world.""[99]Although the film's makers calledFight Club""an accurate portrayal of men in the 1990s,"" some critics called it ""irresponsible and appalling."" Writing forThe Australian, Christopher Goodwin stated, ""Fight Clubis shaping up to be the most contentious mainstream Hollywood meditation on violence sinceStanley Kubrick'sA Clockwork Orange.""[100]Janet Maslin, reviewing forThe New York Times, praised Fincher's direction and editing of the film. She wrote thatFight Clubcarried a message of ""contemporary manhood"", and that, if not watched closely, the film could be misconstrued as an endorsement of violence and nihilism.[101]Roger Ebert, reviewing for theChicago Sun-Times, gaveFight Clubtwo stars out of four, calling it ""visceral and hard-edged"", but also ""a thrill ride masquerading as philosophy"", whose promising first act is followed by a second that panders to macho sensibilities and a third he dismissed as ""trickery"".[102]Ebert later acknowledged that the film was ""beloved by most, not by me"".[103]He was later requested to have a shot-by-shot analysis ofFight Clubat theConference on World Affairs; he stated that ""[s]eeing it over the course of a week, I admired its skill even more, and its thought even less.""[104]Jay Carr ofThe Boston Globeopined that the film began with an ""invigoratingly nervy and imaginative buzz"", but that it eventually became ""explosively silly"".[105]Newsweek's David Ansen describedFight Clubas ""an outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload"" and thought that the ending was too pretentious.[106]Richard SchickelofTimedescribed themise en scèneas dark and damp: ""It enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters' aboveground life and their underground one. Water, even when it's polluted, is the source of life; blood, even when it's carelessly spilled, is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply: it's better to be wet than dry."" Schickel applauded the performances of Pitt and Norton, but criticized the ""conventionally gimmicky"" unfolding and the failure to make Bonham Carter's character interesting.[107]The film review websiteMetacriticsurveyed36 criticsand assessed 24 reviews as positive, 10 as mixed, and 2 as negative. It gave an aggregate score of 67 out of 100, which it said indicated ""generally favorable"" reviews.[108]The similar websiteRotten Tomatoessurveyed185 criticsand, categorizing the reviews as positive or negative, assessed 149 as positive and 36 as negative. For the subset of reviews that had scores, it determined an average rating of 7.4 out of 10. It gave the film a score of 81% and summarized the critical consensus, ""Solid acting, amazing direction, and elaborate production design makeFight Cluba wild ride.""[109]Accolades[edit]Fight Clubwas nominated for the 2000Academy Award for Best Sound Editing, but it lost toThe Matrix.[110]Bonham Carter won the 2000Empire Award for Best British Actress.[111]The Online Film Critics Society also nominatedFight ClubforBest Film,Best Director,Best Actor(Norton),Best Editing, andBest Adapted Screenplay(Uhls).[112]Though the film won none of the awards, the organization listedFight Clubas one of the top ten films of 1999.[113]The soundtrack was nominated for aBRIT Award, losing toNotting Hill.[114]Legacy and cultural impact[edit]Main article:Interpretations of Fight ClubFight Clubwas one of the most controversial and talked-about films of the 1990s.[21][115]The film was perceived as the forerunner of a new mood in American political life. Like other 1999 filmsMagnolia,Being John Malkovich, andThree Kings,Fight Clubwas recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style, since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology.[116]AfterFight Club's theatrical release, it became more popular viaword of mouth,[117]and the positive reception of the DVD established it as a cult film that David Ansen ofNewsweekconjectured would enjoy ""perennial"" fame.[118][119]The film's success also heightened Palahniuk's profile to global renown.[120]FollowingFight Club's release, several fight clubs were reported to have started in the United States. A ""Gentleman's Fight Club"" was started inMenlo Park, California, in 2000 and had members mostly from the tech industry.[121]Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs. In 2006, an unwilling participant from a local high school was injured at a fight club inArlington, Texas, and the DVD sales of the fight led to the arrest of six teenagers.[122]An unsanctioned fight club was also started atPrinceton University, where matches were held on campus.[123]The film was suspected of influencingLuke Helder, a college student who plantedpipe bombsin mailboxes in 2002. Helder's goal was to create asmileypattern on the map of the United States, similar to the scene inFight Clubin which a building is vandalized to have a smiley on its exterior.[124]On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club inManhattanwas charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside aStarbucks Coffeeshop on theUpper East Side. TheNew York City Police Departmentreported the suspect was trying to emulate ""Project Mayhem"".[125]Fight Clubhad a significant impact onevangelical Christianity, in the areas ofChristian discipleshipand masculinity. A number of churches called theircell groups""fight clubs"" with a stated purpose of meeting regularly to ""beat up the fleshand believe the gospel of grace"".[126][127]Some churches, especiallyMars Hill ChurchinSeattle, whose pastorMark Driscollwas obsessed with the film,[128]picked up the film's emphasis on masculinity, and rejection of self-care. Jessica Johnson suggests that Driscoll even called on ""his brothers-in-arms to foment a movement not unlike Project Mayhem.""[129]AFight Clubvideo gamewas released byVivendi Universal Gamesin 2004 for thePlayStation 2,Xbox, and formobile phones. The game was a critical and commercial failure, and was panned by such publications and websites asGameSpot,Game Informer, andIGN.[130][131][132]The video gameJet Set Radio, initially released in 2000 forSega'sDreamcastconsole, was inspired by the film'santi-establishmentthemes.[133]In 2003,Fight Clubwas listed as one of the ""50 Best Guy Movies of All Time"" byMen's Journal.[134]In 2004 and 2006,Fight Clubwas voted byEmpirereaders as the eighth and tenth greatest film of all time, respectively.[135][136]Total FilmrankedFight Clubas ""The Greatest Film of our Lifetime"" in 2007 during the magazine's tenth anniversary.[137]In 2007,Premiereselected Tyler Durden's line, ""The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club,"" as the 27th greatest movie line of all time.[138]In 2008, readers ofEmpireranked Tyler Durden eighth on a list of the 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[139]Empirealso identifiedFight Clubas the 10th greatest movie of all time in its 2008 issueThe 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[140]In 2010, two viralmash-up videosfeaturingFight Clubwere released.Ferris Clubwas a mash-up ofFight Cluband the 1986 filmFerris Bueller's Day Off. It portrayed Ferris as Tyler Durden and Cameron as the narrator, ""claiming to see the real psychological truth behind theJohn Hughesclassic"".[141]The second video,Jane Austen's Fight Club, also gained popularity online as a mash-up ofFight Club's fighting rules and the characters created by 19th-century novelistJane Austen.[142]In a 2023 interview, Fincher expressed that he was appalled by some interpretations of the film bymasculinists, stating: “The fact that it has been misinterpreted by people whose points of view I couldn’t really imagine is alarming.” He added that he “thought the movie was funny,” and emphasized that both the novel and the film were “fairly obviously” a critique of the “NietzscheanÜbermensch,” as well as “a cautionary tale about what to do with the anger engendered by your disenfranchisement.”[143]See also[edit]United States portalFilm portalList of American films of 1999List of cult filmsNotes[edit]^Fight Club, a film by the American studio 20th Century Fox, is often found in databases and related summaries to have the countries US and Germany, the latter being ascribable to the role of international funding.[2][3]References[edit]^abcdef""Fight Club"".Box Office Mojo.IMDb.

It depicts adystopianfuture in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside the Matrix, asimulated realitycreated byintelligent machines. Believing computer hackerNeoto be ""the One"" prophesied to defeat them,Morpheusrecruits him into a rebellion against the machines.Following the success ofBound(1996),Warner Bros.gave the go-ahead forThe Matrixafter the Wachowskis sent an edit of the film's opening minutes. Action scenes were influenced byanimeandmartial arts films, (particularlyfight choreographersandwire futechniques fromHong Kong action cinema). Other influences includePlato's caveand 1990sTelnethacker communities. The film popularized terms such as thered pill, and popularised a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which a character's heightened perception is represented by allowing the action within ashotto progress inslow motionwhile the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed.The Matrixopened in theaters in the United States on March 31, 1999, to widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its innovative visual effects, action sequences, cinematography and entertainment value.[6][7]The film was a box office success, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 1999 and thefourth-highest-grossing film of that year. The film received nominations at the72nd Academy AwardsforBest Visual Effects,Best Film Editing,Best Soundand Best Sound Effects Editing, winning all four categories. The film was also the recipient of numerous other accolades, includingBest SoundandBest Special Visual Effectsat the53rd British Academy Film Awards, and the Wachowskis were awardedBest DirectorandBest Science Fiction Filmat the26th Saturn Awards.The Matrixis considered to be among the greatest science fiction films of all time,[8][9][10]and in 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressfor being ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant"".[11]The film's success led to two sequels by the Wachowskis, both released in 2003,The Matrix ReloadedandThe Matrix Revolutions. TheMatrixfranchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and an animatedanthology film,The Animatrix, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth film, titledThe Matrix Resurrections, directed solely byLana Wachowskiwas released in 2021.Plot[edit]In 1999, in an unnamed city, Thomas Anderson, a computer programmer known as ""Neo"" in hacking circles, delves into the mystery of the ""Matrix"". His search brings him to the attention of hackerTrinity, who discloses that the enigmaticMorpheuscan answer Neo's questions. At his workplace, Neo is pursued by police andAgentsled byAgent Smith. Morpheus guides Neo's escape by phone, able to somehow remotely observe their movements, but Neo ultimately surrenders rather than risk a hazardous getaway.The Agents interrogate Neo about Morpheus but he refuses to cooperate. In response, they seal Neo's mouth shut and implant a robotic device in his abdomen. Neo awakens at home, initially dismissing the encounter as a nightmare until Trinity and her allies arrive, extract the implanted tracker, and bring Neo to Morpheus, their leader. Morpheus offers Neo a choice: a red pill to uncover the truth about the Matrix or a blue pill to forget everything and return to his normal life. Opting for the red pill, Neo's reality distorts, and he awakens submerged in a mechanical pod with invasive cables running throughout his body. Neo witnesses countless inert humans similarly encased and tended to by machines before he is ejected from the facility and rescued by Morpheus aboard the hovercraft, theNebuchadnezzar.Morpheus reveals that the year is approximately 2199. In the 21st century, humanity lost a war with their artificially intelligent creations, leaving the Earth a devastated ruin. As a last resort, humans blackened the sky to eliminate the machines' access to solar power and, in response, the machines developed farms of artificially grown humans to harness their bioelectric energy. The Matrix is a simulated reality based on human civilization at its peak, designed to keep the subjugated humans oblivious and pacified. The remaining free humans established an underground refuge known as Zion, living a harsh existence on scarce resources. Morpheus and his rebel crew hack into the Matrix to free and recruit others, manipulating the rules of the simulation to gain superhuman physical abilities. Even so, they are outmatched by the overwhelmingly powerful Agents—sentient programs protecting the Matrix—and dying in the Matrix causes death in the real world. Morpheus liberated Neo because he believes him to be ""the One"", a prophesied figure destined to dismantle the Matrix and liberate humanity.The crew enter the Matrix to seek guidance fromthe Oracle, the prophetic figure who foretold the existence of the One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns him of an imminent choice between his life and Morpheus's. The crew are ambushed by Agents after being betrayed by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who wants to be reinserted into the Matrix to enjoy its comforts. Convinced of Neo's importance, Morpheus sacrifices himself to confront Smith, only to be overpowered and captured. Meanwhile, Cypher exits the Matrix and begins forcefully disconnecting the others, killing them. Before Cypher can kill Neo and Trinity, Tank, a subdued crew member, regains consciousness, kills Cypher, and safely extracts the survivors.Smith interrogates Morpheus to obtain access codes for Zion's mainframe, which would allow them to end the human resistance. Determined to rescue Morpheus, Neo reenters the Matrix with Trinity. They successfully free Morpheus, who escapes the Matrix with Trinity, but Smith intercepts Neo. Gaining confidence in his abilities, Neo fights Smith, demonstrating comparable power and eventually killing him. However, Smith resurrects in a new body and kills Neo.In the real world, machines called Sentinels attack theNebuchadnezzar. Standing by Neo's real body, Trinity confesses her love for him and that the Oracle prophesied she would fall in love with the One. In the Matrix, Neo revives with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly destroys Smith and exits the Matrix just as theNebuchadnezzar's electromagnetic pulse disables the ship's power and the Sentinels. Sometime later, within the Matrix, Neo communicates with the system, promising to show the enslaved humans a world of limitless possibilities, before flying away.Cast[edit]See also:List of Matrix series charactersTop to bottom:Keanu Reeves,Laurence Fishburne, andCarrie-Anne Mossstar in the film asNeo,MorpheusandTrinityrespectively.Keanu ReevesasNeo: A computer programmer, born Thomas A. Anderson, who secretly operates as a hacker named Neo. Reeves described his character as someone who felt that something was wrong, and was searching for Morpheus and the truth to break free.[12]Will Smithturned down the role of Neo to makeWild Wild West, because of skepticism over the film's ambitious bullet time special effects.[13]He later stated he was ""not mature enough as an actor"" at that time,[13]and that if given the role, he ""would have messed it up"".[14][15]Smith praised Reeves for his portrayal.[16]Nicolas Cagealso turned down the part because of ""family obligations"".[17]Warner Bros. soughtBrad PittorVal Kilmerfor the role.[18]When both declined,Leonardo DiCaprioinitially accepted the role, but ultimately turned it down because he did not want to do a visual effects film directly afterTitanic.[19]The studio pushed for Reeves, who won the role overJohnny Depp, the Wachowskis' first choice.[18]Lorenzo di Bonaventurastated that the screenplay was also sent toSandra Bullock, with the suggestion of rewriting Neo as a female.[19]Laurence FishburneasMorpheus: A human freed from the Matrix and captain of theNebuchadnezzar. Fishburne stated that once he read the script, he did not understand why other people found it confusing. However, he doubted if the movie would ever be made, because it was ""so smart"".[12]The Wachowskis instructed Fishburne to base his performance on the characterMorpheusinNeil Gaiman'sSandmancomics.[20]Carrie-Anne MossasTrinity: A human freed by Morpheus, a crewmember of theNebuchadnezzar, and later Neo's romantic interest. After reading the script, Moss stated that at first, she did not believe she had to do the extreme acrobatic actions as described in the script. She also doubted how the Wachowskis would get to direct a movie with a budget so large, but after spending an hour with them going through the storyboard, she understood why some people would trust them.[12]Moss mentioned that she underwent a three-hour physical test during casting, so she knew what to expect subsequently.[21]The role made Moss, who later said, ""I had no career before. None.""[22]Janet Jacksonwas initially approached for the role but scheduling conflicts prevented her from accepting it.[23][24]In an interview, she stated that turning down the role was difficult for her, so she later referencedThe Matrixin the 'Intro' and 'Outro' interludes on her tenth studio albumDiscipline.[25]Sandra Bullock, who was previously approached for the role of Neo, was also offered the role of Trinity, but she turned it down.[26]Rosie Perez,Salma HayekandJada Pinkett Smith(who would later playNiobein the sequels) auditioned for the role.[27][28][29]Hugo WeavingasAgent Smith: A sentient ""Agent"" program of the Matrix whose purpose is to destroy Zion and stop humans from getting out of the Matrix. Unlike other Agents, he has ambitions to free himself from his duties. Weaving stated that he found the character amusing and enjoyable to play. He developed a neutral accent but with more specific character for the role. He wanted Smith to sound neither robotic nor human, and also said that the Wachowskis' voices had influenced his voice in the film. When filming began, Weaving mentioned that he was excited to be a part of something that would extend him.[30]Jean Renowas offered the role, but declined, unwilling to move toAustraliafor the production.[31]Gloria FosterasThe Oracle: A prophet who still resides in the Matrix, helping the freed humans with her foresight and wisdom.Joe Pantolianoas Cypher: Another human freed by Morpheus, and a crewmember of theNebuchadnezzar, but one who regrets taking the red pill and seeks to be returned to the Matrix, later betraying the rebels to Agent Smith. Pantoliano had worked with the Wachowskis prior to appearing inThe Matrix, starring in their 1996 filmBound.Marcus Chongas Tank: The ""operator"" of theNebuchadnezzarand Dozer's brother; they are both ""natural"" (as opposed to bred) humans, born outside of the Matrix.Paul Goddardas Agent Brown: One of two sentient ""Agent"" programs in the Matrix, who works with Agent Smith to destroy Zion and stop humans from escaping the system.Robert Tayloras Agent Jones: One of two sentient ""Agent"" programs in the Matrix who works with Agent Smith to destroy Zion and stop humans from escaping the system.Julian Arahangaas Apoc: A freed human and a crew member on theNebuchadnezzar.Matt Doranas Mouse: A freed human and a programmer on theNebuchadnezzar.Belinda McCloryas Switch: A human freed by Morpheus, and a crew member of theNebuchadnezzar.Anthony Ray Parkeras Dozer: Pilot of theNebuchadnezzar. He is Tank's brother, and like him was born outside of the Matrix.Rowan Wittas The Spoon Boy, a young prophet who has learnt how to manipulate the world of the Matrix. Seemingly wise beyond his years, he teaches Neo how to develop his powers and provides him with wisdom and motivation across the films and graphic novels.Ada Nicodemouas DuJour: A reference to theWhite RabbitinAlice's Adventures in Wonderland.Production[edit]Development[edit]In 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the filmAssassinstoWarner Bros. Pictures. AfterLorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures,BoundandThe Matrix, in the contract. The first movie the Wachowskis directed,Bound, then became a critical success. Using this momentum, they later asked to directThe Matrix.[32]Reeves said that the Matrix avatar would have been a ""different sex than the Zion reality"" in the early draft of the script, but the studio was not ready for that version.[33]In 1996, the Wachowskis pitched the role of Neo toWill Smith. Smith explained on hisYouTubechannel that the idea was for him to be Neo, while Morpheus was to be played byVal Kilmer. He later explained that he did not quite understand the concept and he turned down the role to instead filmWild Wild West.[34]Madonnaalso turned down an undisclosed role, a decision she would later regret.[35]ProducerJoel Silversoon joined the project. Although the project had key supporters, including Silver and Di Bonaventura, to influence the company,The Matrixwas still a huge investment for Warner Bros., which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with prominent actors and difficult special effects.[32]The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artistsGeof DarrowandSteve Skroceto draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film.[36][37][38]The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget.[32]Soon,The Matrixbecame a co-production of Warner Bros. andVillage Roadshow Pictures.[39]According to editorZach Staenbergon the DVD audio commentary track, the production team sent an edit of the film's first minutes (featuring Trinity's encounter with police and Agents) to Warner executives, and secured Warner's ""total support of the movie"" from then on.[40]Pre-production[edit]The cast were required to be able to understand and explainThe Matrix.[32]French philosopherJean Baudrillard'sSimulacra and Simulationwas required reading for most of the principal cast and crew.[41]In early 1997, the Wachowskis had Reeves and Moss readSimulacra and Simulation,Kevin Kelly'sOut of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, andDylan Evans's ideas onevolutionary psychologyeven before they opened up the script.[12]Eventually, Reeves was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved.[32]Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process.[12]The directors had long been admirers ofHong Kong action cinema, so they decided to hire the Chinesemartial arts choreographerand film directorYuen Woo-pingto work on fight scenes. To prepare for thewire fu, the actors had to train hard for several months.[32]The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training, beginning in October 1997.[42]Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were.[21]Yuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actor's strength. He built on Reeves's diligence, Fishburne's resilience, Weaving's precision and Moss's grace.[21]Yuen designed Moss's moves to suit her deftness and lightness.[43]Prior to the pre-production, Reeves underwent a two-level fusion of his cervical (neck) spine due to spinal cord compression from a herniated disc (""I was falling over in the shower in the morning"").[44]He was still recovering by the time of pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film.[21][45]Weaving had to undergohip surgeryafter he sustained an injury during the training process.[32]Filming[edit]Campbell Street train bridge at the intersection of Elizabeth Street was one of the filming locations in the city of Sydney.All but a few scenes were filmed atFox Studiosin Sydney, as well as in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included to maintain the impression of a generic American city. The filming helped establishNew South Walesas a major film production center.[46][47]Filming began in March 1998 and wrapped in August 1998;principal photographytook 118 days.[48]Some filming also occurred atCulver Studios.[49]Due to Reeves's neck injury (see above), some of the action scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery. As a result, the filming began with scenes that did not require much physical exertion,[50][51]such as the scene in Thomas Anderson's office, the interrogation room,[30]or the car ride in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle.[52]Locations for these scenes includedMartin Place'sfountain in Sydney, halfway between it and the adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself.[53]During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case thebullet timeprocess did not work. The bullet-time fight scene was filmed on the roof ofSymantecCorporation building in Kent Street, oppositeSussex Street.[54]Moss performed the shots featuring Trinity at the beginning of the film and all the wire stunts herself.[43]The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production ofDark City, which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films.[55]During the rehearsal of the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it.[56]Fishburne later said that while being in Sydney to shoot the film, he experienced a racist vibe and that it felt like America in the 1950s.[57]Thedojoset was built well before the actual filming. During the filming of these action sequences, there was significant physical contact between the actors, earning them bruises. Reeves's injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to filming meant he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself, causing the scene to be postponed. The scene was shot successfully a few days later, with Reeves using only three takes. Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene, creating a training feel.[58]The filmmakers originally planned to shoot the subway scene in an actualsubway station, but the complexity of the fight and related wire work required shooting the scene on a set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling,Chad Stahelski, Reeves's stunt double, sustained several injuries, includingbroken ribs, knees and adislocated shoulder. Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot in which Neo was slammed into a booth.[59]The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the outside view from inside the building was a large, three story highcyclorama. The helicopter was a full-scale, light-weight mock-up suspended by a wire rope operated a tilting mechanism mounted to the studio roofbeams. The helicopter had a real minigun side-mounted to it, which was set to cycle at half its regular (3,000 rounds per minute) firing rate.[60]To prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod, Reeves lost 15 pounds (7 kg) and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look. The scene in which Neo fell into the sewer system concluded the principal photography.[48]According toThe Art of the Matrix, at least one filmed scene and a variety of short pieces of action were omitted from the final cut of the film.[61]Sound effects and music[edit]See also:The Matrix: Original Motion Picture ScoreandThe Matrix: Music from the Motion PictureDane A. Daviswas responsible for creating the sound effects for the film. The fight scene sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches, were created using thin metal rods and recording them, then editing the sounds. The sound of the pod containing a human body closing required almost fifty sounds put together.[62]The film'sscore,The Matrix: Original Motion Picture Score, was composed byDon Davis.[63][64]He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporatecontrapuntalideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.[65]In addition to Davis' score,The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picturealso features music from acts such asRammstein,Rob Dougan,Rage Against the Machine,Propellerheads,Ministry,Lunatic Calm,Deftones,Monster Magnet,The Prodigy,Rob Zombie,Meat Beat ManifestoandMarilyn Manson.[66][67][68]Production design[edit]See also:Matrix digital rainIn the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters.[69]This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley,[39]which includes mirror images ofhalf-width kanacharacters and Western Latin letters and Arabic numerals.[70]In a 2017 interview atCNET, he attributed the design to his wife, who is from Japan, and added, ""I like to tell everybody that The Matrix's code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes"".[71]""The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on earlymonochrome computer monitors"".[72]Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor atAnimal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall.[39]The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995Japanese cyberpunkfilm,Ghost in the Shell, which had a strong influence on theMatrixseries. It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the gameThe Matrix: Path of Neo, and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for theMatrixseries. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence.[39]The Matrix'sproduction designer,Owen Paterson, used methods to distinguish the ""real world"" and the Matrix in a pervasive way. The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code's distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the ""real world"". In addition, the Matrix scenes' sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment. For the ""real world"", the actors' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors.[70]TheNebuchadnezzarwas designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on productions such asStar Trek. The wires were made visible to show the ship's working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as ""a marriage between Man and Machine"".[73]For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used and sinister. During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester suffered hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated.[48]Kym Barrett, costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume.[74]For example, Reeves's office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled and out of place.[50]Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider the practicality of the acting. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their clothing, and be able to work the wires while strapped into the harnesses.[74]For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbed and reflected different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity's costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character.[43]For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the filmJFKand classicmen in black.[30]The sunglasses, a staple of the film's aesthetics, were commissioned for the film by designer Richard Walker from sunglasses maker Blinde Design.[75]Visual effects[edit]The ""bullet time"" effect was created for the film. A scene would be computer-modeled to decide the positioning of the physical cameras. The actor then provided their performance in achroma keysetup, while the cameras were fired in rapid succession, with fractions of a second delay between each shot. The result was combined with CGI backgrounds to create the final effect at (0:33).As for artistic inspiration for bullet time, I would creditOtomo Katsuhiro, who co-wrote and directedAkira, which definitely blew me away, along with directorMichel Gondry. His music videos experimented with a different type of technique called view-morphing and it was just part of the beginning of uncovering the creative approaches toward using still cameras for special effects. Our technique was significantly different because we built it to move around objects that were themselves in motion, and we were also able to create slow-motion events that 'virtual cameras' could move around—rather than the static action in Gondry's music videos with limited camera moves.—John Gaeta[76]The film is known for popularizing avisual effect[77]known as ""bullet time"", which allows ashotto progress inslow motionwhile the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed.[78][79]Bullet time has been described as ""a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix"",[80]and throughout the film, the effect is used to illustrate characters' exertion of control over time and space.[81]The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects, and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film. WhenJohn Gaetaread the script, he pleaded with an effects producer atMass.Illusionto let him work on the project, and created a prototype that led to him becoming the film's visual effects supervisor.[82][83]The method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera captures a still picture, contributing one frame to the video sequence, which creates the effect of ""virtual camera movement""; the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time.[78]The bullet time effect is similar but slightly more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so that rather than appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion.[76][82]The cameras' positions and exposures wereprevisualizedusing a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect.[78]When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached aframe frequencyof 12,000 per second, as opposed to the normal 24 frames per second of film.[32]Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side.[78]To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.[citation needed]The photo-realistic surroundings generated by this method were incorporated into the bullet time scene,[82]and algorithms based onoptical flowwere used to interpolate between the still images to produce a fluent dynamic motion;[84][85]the computer-generated ""lead in"" and ""lead out"" slides were filled in between frames in sequence to get an illusion of orbiting the scene.[86]Manex Visual Effects used aclusterfarm running theUnix-likeoperating systemFreeBSDto render many of the film's visual effects.[87][88]Manex also handled creature effects, such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes;Animal Logiccreated the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.[89]Thephotogrammetricand image-basedcomputer-generatedbackground approaches inThe Matrix's bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequelsThe Matrix ReloadedandThe Matrix Revolutions. The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters' motions and expressions. It also led to the development of ""Universal Capture"", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras.[82]Release[edit]Home media[edit]The Matrixwas released onDVDandLaserdiscin its originalaspect ratioof2.39:1on September 21, 1999, in the US fromWarner Home Videoas well as in1.33:1aspect ratio inHong Kongfrom ERA Home Entertainment. It was also released onVHSin bothfull screenandwidescreenformats onDecember 7, 1999.[5]After its DVD release, it was the first DVD to sell more than one million copies in the US.[90]By 2000, the film went on to become the first to sell more than three million copies in the US.[32]At that point, it became the top-selling DVD release of all time, holding this record for a few months before being surpassed byGladiator.[91]ByNovember 10, 2003, one month afterThe Matrix ReloadedDVD was released, the sales ofThe MatrixDVD had exceeded 30 million copies.[92]It then debuted on both VHS and DVD formats in the UK onNovember 29, 1999.The Matrixsold more than 107,000 DVD copies in just two weeks, breakingArmageddon's record for being the country's best-selling DVD title.[93]The Ultimate Matrix Collectionwas released onHD DVDonMay 22, 2007,[90]and onBlu-rayonOctober 14, 2008.[94][95]The film was also released standalone in a 10th-anniversary edition Blu-ray in the Digibook format onMarch 31, 2009, ten years to the day after the film was released theatrically.[96]In 2010, the film had another DVD release along with the two sequels asThe Complete Matrix Trilogy. It was also released on 4K HDR Blu-ray on May 22, 2018.[97]The film as part ofThe Matrix Trilogywas released on4KUltra HD Blu-rayon October 30, 2018.[98]Other media[edit]The franchise also contains four video games:Enter the Matrix(2003), which contains footage shot specifically for the game and chronicles events taking place before and duringThe Matrix Reloaded;[99]The Matrix Online(2004), anMMORPGwhich continued the story beyondThe Matrix Revolutions;[100][101]The Matrix: Path of Neo(2005), which focuses on Neo's journey through the trilogy of films;[102]andThe Matrix Awakens(2021), an interactive technology demonstration developed byEpic GamesusingUnreal Engine 5.[103]The franchise also includesThe Matrix Comics, a series ofcomicsand short stories set in the world ofThe Matrix, written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the officialMatrixwebsite;[104]they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printedtrade paperbackvolumes, calledThe Matrix Comics, Vol 1 and Vol 2.[105]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]The Matrixgrossed $27.8 million during its opening weekend, as well as earning $37.4 million in its first five days.[106]It surpassedLost in SpaceandIndecent Proposalsimultaneously for having the biggest April andEasteropening weekends.[106]The film also had the second-highest opening weekend for a spring starter film, trailing behindLiar Liar.[106]Three years later in 2002,The Matrix's records for having the largest April and Easter opening weekends would be taken byThe Scorpion KingandPanic Roomrespectively.[107][108]Upon its opening, it had the highest opening weekend of any 1999 film, easily toppingPayback.[106]Additionally, this was the biggest opening weekend for aKeanu Reevesfilm sinceSpeedin 1994.[109]It would go on to rank number one at the box office during its first weekend, beating outForces of Nature,10 Things I Hate About You,The Out-of-Towners,Analyze ThisandEDtv.[106]The film would remain at the top of the box office for two weeks until it was overtaken byLife.[110]During its fourth weekend,The Matrixbriefly returned to the number one spot.[111][112]The following week, the film would be displaced byEntrapment.[113]In the UK,The Matrixearned $4.9 million in its first three days, ranking it as the third-highest opening weekend for aWarner Bros.film, behindBatman ForeverandBatman & Robin, while also delivering the third-highest opening weekend of the year, afterA Bug's LifeandNotting Hill.[114]The film grossed $1.8 million in Taiwan, making the third-highest opening there, behindArmageddonandThe Lost World: Jurassic Park.[114]Additionally, it managed to surpassLethal Weapon 4for having the market's highest opening for Warner Bros.[114]It also surpassedEraserto secure the distributor's highest opening weekend in Germany, collecting $592,000.[114]In its original run, the film earned $171,479,930 (37.0%) in the United States and Canada and $292,037,453 (63.0%) in other countries, for a worldwide total of $463,517,383.[5]InNorth America, it went on to become the fifth highest-grossing film of 1999 and the highest-grossing R-rated film of that year. Worldwide, it was the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year, afterStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace,The Sixth SenseandToy Story 2.[5]The Matrixbecame the second-highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time, behindTwister.[115]Overall, it was the third-highest-grossing R-rated film at the time, just afterSaving Private RyanandTerminator 2: Judgment Day.[115]Following re-releases, the worldwide gross of the film is $466,621,824.[5]In 2012, it was placed 122nd on the list of highest-grossing films of all time, and the second-highest-grossing film in theMatrixfranchise afterThe Matrix Reloaded($742.1 million).[5]Critical response[edit]The Matrixwas praised by many critics, as well as filmmakers, and authors of science fiction,[7]especially for its ""spectacular action"" scenes and its ""groundbreaking special effects"". Some have describedThe Matrixas one of the bestscience fiction filmsof all time;[8][9]Entertainment WeeklycalledThe Matrix""the most influential action movie of the generation"".[22]There have also been those, including philosopherWilliam Irwin, who have suggested that the film explores significant philosophical and spiritual themes. Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 210 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Thanks to the Wachowskis' imaginative vision,The Matrixis a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects"".[6]AtMetacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received a score of 73 based on 35 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[7]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.[116]It ranked 323rd among critics, and 546th among directors, in the2012Sight & Soundpolls of the greatest films ever made.[117]Philip Strick commented inSight & Sound, if the Wachowskis ""claim no originality of message, they are startling innovators of method,"" praising the film's details and its ""broadside of astonishing images"".[118]Roger Ebertgave the film three stars out of four: he praised the film's visuals and premise, but disliked thethird act's focus on action.[119]Similarly,Time Outpraised the ""entertainingly ingenious"" switches between different realities,Hugo Weaving's ""engagingly odd"" performance, and the film's cinematography and production design, but concluded, ""the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic ... yet another slice of overlong, high-concept hokum.""[120]Jonathan Rosenbaumof theChicago Readerreviewed the film negatively, criticizing it as ""simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour, until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources ... There's not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome.""[121]Ian Nathan ofEmpiredescribed Carrie-Anne Moss as ""a major find"", praised the ""surreal visual highs"" enabled by the bullet time (or ""flo-mo"") effect, and described the film as ""technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool"". Nathan remarked that although the film's ""looney plot"" would not stand up to scrutiny, that was not a big flaw because ""The Matrixis about pure experience"".[122]Maitland McDonaghsaid in her review forTV Guide, the Wachowskis' ""through-the-looking-glass plot... manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels: as a dystopian sci-fi thriller, as a brilliant excuse for the film's lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes, and as a pretty compelling call to the dead-above-the-eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains... This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits.""[123]Salon's reviewer Andrew O'Hehir acknowledged that althoughThe Matrixis in his view a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film (""It lacks anything like adult emotion... all this pseudo-spiritual hokum, along with the over-ramped onslaught of special effects—some of them quite amazing—will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture, not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside""), he concluded, ""as inBound, there's an appealing scope and daring to the Wachowskis' work, and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense, this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction, but their passion formovies—for making them, watching them, inhabiting their world—is pure and deep.""[124]Filmmakers and science fiction creators alike generally took a complimentary perspective ofThe Matrix.William Gibson, a key figure in cyberpunk fiction, called the film ""an innocent delight I hadn't felt in a long time"", and stated, ""Neo is my favourite-ever science fiction hero, absolutely.""[125]Joss Whedoncalled the film ""my number one"" and praised its storytelling, structure and depth, concluding, ""It works on whatever level you want to bring to it"".[126]Darren Aronofskycommented, ""I walked out ofThe Matrix... and I was thinking, 'What kind of science fiction movie can people make now?' The Wachowskis basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured.""[127]M. Night Shyamalanexpressed admiration for the Wachowskis, stating, ""Whatever you think ofThe Matrix, every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!"".[128]Simon Peggsaid thatThe Matrixprovided ""the excitement and satisfaction thatThe Phantom Menacefailed to inspire.The Matrixseemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen.""[129]Quentin TarantinocountedThe Matrixas one of his twenty favorite movies from 1992 to 2009.[130]James Cameroncalled it ""one of the most profoundly fresh science fiction films ever made"".[131]Christopher Nolandescribed it as ""an incredibly palpable mainstream phenomenon that made people think, Hey, what if this isn't real?""[132]Accolades[edit]Main article:List of accolades received by the Matrix franchiseThe MatrixreceivedAcademy AwardsforBest Film Editing, Best Sound Editing,Best Visual EffectsandBest Sound.[133][134]The filmmakers were competing against other films with established franchises, likeStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace, yet they won all four of their nominations.[135][136]The Matrixalso receivedBAFTAawards forBest SoundandBest Achievement in Special Visual Effects, in addition to nominations in thecinematography,production designandeditingcategories.[137]In 1999, it wonSaturn AwardsforBest Science Fiction FilmandBest Direction.[138]In February 2022, the film was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of theAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' ""Oscars Fan Favorite"" contest, for the ""bullet time"" scene, finishing in fifth place.[139][140]Awards and nominations[edit]AwardCategoryNameOutcomeAcademy AwardsBest Film EditingZach StaenbergWonBest SoundJohn Reitz,Gregg Rudloff,David Campbell,David LeeWonBest Sound Effects EditingDane A.

C. Escher.[143]A resemblance to the eerie worlds of Swiss artistH. R. Gigerwas also recognized.[144][145]The pods can be seen inWelcome to ParadoxEpisode 4 ""News from D Street"" from a 1986 short story[146]of the same name byAndrew Weinerwhich aired on September 7, 1998, on theSYFY Channeland has a remarkably similar concept. In this episode the hero is unaware he is living in virtual reality until he is told so by ""the code man"" who created the simulation and enters it knowingly. The Wachowskis have describedStanley Kubrick's2001: A Space Odysseyas a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when makingThe Matrix.[147][148][149]Reviewers have also commented on similarities betweenThe Matrixand other late-1990s films such asStrange Days,Dark CityandThe Truman Show.[b]The similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running seriesDoctor Whohas also been noted. As in the film, theMatrixof that series (introduced in the 1976 serialThe Deadly Assassin) is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.[154]The action scenes ofThe Matrixwere also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of directorJohn Woo.[155]The martial arts sequences were inspired byFist of Legend, a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starringJet Li. The fight scenes inFist of Legendled to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer.[156][157]The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration forJapanese animationsuch asNinja ScrollandAkira.[158]DirectorMamoru Oshii's 1995 animated filmGhost in the Shellwas a particularly strong influence;[158]producerJoel Silverhas stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions forThe Matrixby showing him that anime and saying, ""We wanna do that for real"".[159][160]Mitsuhisa IshikawaofProduction I.G, which producedGhost in the Shell, noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, ""...cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine thatThe Matrixis the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios"". He stated that sinceGhost in the Shellhad gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a ""promotional tool"".[161]Literary works[edit]The film makes several references toLewis Carroll'sAlice's Adventures in Wonderland.[124]Comparisons have also been made toGrant Morrison's comic seriesThe Invisibles, with Morrison describing it in 2011 as ""(it) seemed to me (to be) my own combination of ideas enacted on the screen"".[162]Comparisons have also been made betweenThe Matrixand the books ofCarlos Castaneda.[163]The Matrixbelongs to thecyberpunkgenre of science fiction, and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the 1984 novelNeuromancerbyWilliam Gibson.[141]For example, the film's use of the term ""Matrix"" is adopted from Gibson's novel,[164]thoughL. P. Davieshad already used the term ""Matrix"" fifteen years earlier for a similar concept in his 1969 novelThe White Room(""It had been tried in the States some years earlier, but their 'matrix' as they called it hadn't been strong enough to hold the fictional character in place"").[165]After watchingThe Matrix, Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was ""exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis"" he had relied upon in his own writing;[141]however, he noted that the film'sGnosticthemes distinguished it fromNeuromancer, and believed thatThe Matrixwas thematically closer to the work of science fiction authorPhilip K. Dick, particularly Dick's speculativeExegesis.[141]Other writers have also commented on the similarities betweenThe Matrixand Dick's work;[155][166][167]one example of such influence is a Philip K. Dick's 1977 conference, in which he stated: ""We are living in a computer-programmed reality, and the only clue we have to it is when some variable is changed, and some alteration in our reality occurs"".[c]Philosophy[edit]InThe Matrix, a copy ofJean Baudrillard's philosophical workSimulacra and Simulation, which was published in French in 1981, is visible on-screen as""the book used to concealdisks"",[172][41]and Morpheus quotes the phrase ""desert of the real"" from it.[173]""The book was required reading""[172]for the actors prior to filming.[41][174]However, Baudrillard himself said thatThe Matrixmisunderstands and distorts his work.[173][175]Some interpreters ofThe Matrixmention Baudrillard's philosophy to support their claim ""that the [film] is anallegoryfor contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries"".[172]The influence ofThe Matrixial Gaze, the philosophical-psychoanalytical concept ofBracha L. Ettingeron the archaic matrixial space that resists the field of simulacra,[176][177][178]""was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such asGriselda Pollockand film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel"".[179][172]In addition to Baudrillard and Ettinger, the Wachowskis were also significantly influenced byKevin Kelly'sOut of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World, andDylan Evans's ideas onevolutionary psychology.[12]PhilosopherWilliam Irwinsuggests that the idea of the ""Matrix"" – a generated reality invented by malicious machines – is an allusion toDescartes' ""First Meditation"", and his idea of anevil demon. The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.[180]The same premise can be found inHilary Putnam'sbrain in a vatscenario proposed in the 1980s.[180]A connection between the premise ofThe MatrixandPlato'sAllegory of the Cavehas also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato'stheory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.[32]The philosophy ofImmanuel Kanthas also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in hisCritique of Pure Reasonthat people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a humanutopia, a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, ""it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost."" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.[181]Religion and mythology[edit]Andrew Godoski sees allusions toChrist, including Neo's ""virgin birth"", his doubt in himself, the prophecy of his coming, along with many otherChristianreferences.[32]Amongst these possible allusions, it is suggested that the name of the characterTrinityrefers to Christianity's doctrine of theTrinity.[182]It has also been noted that the character Morpheus paraphrases the ChineseTaoistphilosopherZhuangziwhen he asks Neo, ""Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?""[183]Matrixismis a fan-based possibly satirical religion created as ""the matrix religion"".Transgender themes[edit]Years after the release ofThe Matrix, both of the Wachowskis came out astransgenderwomen.[184]The red pill has been compared with redestrogenpills.[185]Morpheus's description of the Matrix creating a sense that something is fundamentally wrong, ""like a splinter in your mind"", has been compared togender dysphoria.[185]In the original script, Switch was a woman in the Matrix and a man in the real world, but this idea was removed.[186]In a 2016GLAAD Media Awardsspeech, Lilly Wachowski said: ""There's a critical eye being cast back on Lana and I's  [sic] work through the lens of our transness. This is a cool thing because it's an excellent reminder that art is never static.""[187]In 2020, Lilly saidThe Matrixwas intended as an allegory for gender transition, but that ""the corporate world wasn't ready"".[188]She said it was ""all about the desire for transformation but it was all coming from a closeted point of view"", but that she did not know ""how present my transness was in the background of my brain"" when the Wachowskis were writing it.[188]In an interview withVarietyin 2020, Reeves said the idea that the Matrix was an allegory for transgender identity ""wasn't introduced to me when we started for production on the films.""[189]Legacy[edit]Filmmaking[edit]FollowingThe Matrix, films made abundant use of slow motion, spinning cameras, and, often, thebullet timeeffect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them.[77]The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, includingMax Payne, in which the feature was explicitly referred to as ""bullet time"".[190][191]It was also the defining game mechanic of the gameSuperhotand its sequels.The Matrix's signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have beenparodiednumerous times,[22]in comedy films such asDeuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo(1999),[192]Scary Movie(2000),[193]Shrek(2001),[190]Kung Pow! Enter the Fist(2002),[194]Lastikman(2003);Marx Reloadedin which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter betweenKarl MarxandLeon Trotsky;[195]and in video games such asConker's Bad Fur Day.[196]It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air;[22]these includedCharlie's Angels(2000) featuringCameron Diazfloating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her;Equilibrium(2002), starringChristian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves' Neo;[190]Night Watch(2004), aRussianmegahit heavily influenced byThe Matrixand directed byTimur Bekmambetov, who later madeWanted(2008), which also features bullets ripping through air; andInception(2010), which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who are able to enter other people's dreams by ""wiring in"". The originalTron(1982) paved the way forThe Matrix, andThe Matrix, in turn, inspiredDisneyto make its own Matrix with aTronsequel,Tron: Legacy(2010).[197]Also, the film's lobby shootout sequence was recreated in the 2002 Indian action comedyAwara Paagal Deewana.[198]Choreographers and actors[edit]The Matrixhad a strong effect on action filmmaking in Hollywood. The film's incorporation ofwire futechniques, including the involvement offight choreographerYuen Woo-pingand other personnel with a background inHong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by some subsequent Hollywood action films,[199]moving them towards more Eastern approaches.[32]The success ofThe Matrixcreated high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed inX-Men(2000)[199]andCharlie's Angels(2000),[197]and Yuen Woo-ping's brotherYuen Cheung-yanwas choreographer onDaredevil(2003).[200]The Matrix's Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such asCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(2000) that they might not otherwise have had.[190]Chad Stahelski, who had been a stunt double onThe Matrixprior to directing Reeves in theJohn Wickseries, acknowledged the film's strong influence on theWickfilms,[201]and commented, ""The Matrixliterally changed the industry. The influx of martial-arts choreographers and fight coordinators now make more, and are more prevalent and powerful in the industry, than stunt coordinators.The Matrixrevolutionized that. Today, action movies want their big sequences designed around the fights.""[202]Carrie-Anne Mossasserted that prior to being cast inThe Matrix, she had ""no career"". It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career; in aNew York Daily Newsinterview, she stated, ""The Matrixgave me so many opportunities. Everything I've done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much"".[203]The film also created one of the most devoted movie fan-followings sinceStar Wars.[22]The combined success of theMatrixtrilogy, theLord of the Ringsfilmsand theStar Warsprequelsmade Hollywood interested in creating trilogies.[32]Stephen Dowling from theBBCnoted thatThe Matrix's success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect.[190]Cultural impact[edit]The Matrixwas also influential for its impact onsuperhero films. John Kenneth Muir inThe Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Televisioncalled the film a ""revolutionary"" reimagination of movie visuals, paving the way for the visuals of later superhero films, and credits it with helping to ""makecomic-booksuperheroeship"" and effectively demonstrating the concept of ""faster than a speeding bullet"" with its bullet time effect.[204]Adam Sternbergh ofVulture.comcreditsThe Matrixwith reinventing and setting the template for modern superhero blockbusters, and inspiring the superhero renaissance in the early 21st century.[205]Modern reception[edit]In 2001,The Matrixplaced 66th in theAmerican Film Institute's ""100 Years...100 Thrills"" list.[206]In 2007,Entertainment WeeklycalledThe Matrixthe best science-fiction piece of media for the past 25 years.[10]In 2009, the film was ranked 39th onEmpire's reader-, actor- and critic-voted list of ""The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time"".[207]The Matrixwas voted as the fourth best science fiction film in the 2011 listBest in Film: The Greatest Movies of Our Time, based on a poll conducted byABCandPeople. In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in theNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressfor being ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.""[11]Red pill and blue pill[edit]Main article:Red pill and blue pillScene from the 1990 filmTotal Recallwhere Dr. Edgemar (Roy Brocksmith) explains that swallowing a red pill is a ""symbol of your desire to return to reality""Historians of film note that the trope of a ""red pill"" as decisive in a return to reality made its first appearance in the 1990 filmTotal Recall, which  has a scene where the hero (played byArnold Schwarzenegger) is asked to swallow a red pill in order to symbolize his desire to return to reality from a dream-like fantasy.[208][209]The premise ofThe Matrixhas been repurposed for multipleconspiracy theoriesandalt-rightfringe groups. For example, some onlinemen's rights groupsuse the term ""redpill"" to mean men realizing that they are supposedly being subjugated by feminism.[210][211]The term has been used in discussion forums for right-wing topics such asGamergate,white supremacy,incelsubculture andQAnon.[212]As of 2021, the verb ""pill"" and suffix ""-pilled"" had entered more mainstream use and had come to mean developing a sudden interest in something.[212]Sequels and adaptations[edit]Main article:The Matrix (franchise)The film's mainstream success led to the making of two sequels,The Matrix ReloadedandThe Matrix Revolutions, both directed by the Wachowskis. These werefilmed back-to-backin oneshootand released on separate dates in 2003.[213]The first film's introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack on the human enclave ofZionby a vast machine army.[214][215]The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes, as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects.[215][216]Also released wasThe Animatrix, a collection of nine animated short films, many of which were created in the sameJapanese animationstyle[217]that was a strong influence on the live action trilogy.The Animatrixwas overseen and approved by the Wachowskis, who only wrote four of the segments themselves but did not direct any of them; much of the project was developed by notable figures from the world of anime.[217]In March 2017, Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise withZak Pennin talks to write a treatment and interest in gettingMichael B. Jordanattached to star. According toThe Hollywood Reporterneither the Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved with the endeavor, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of the Wachowskis.[218]On August 20, 2019, Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairmanToby Emmerichofficially announced that a fourth Matrix film was in the works, withKeanu ReevesandCarrie-Anne Mossset to reprise their roles as Neo and Trinity, respectively.[219]The Matrix Resurrectionswas released in theaters and on HBO Max on December 22, 2021.In September 2022,Danny Boylewas announced to be directing and producing a live immersive dance production of the film, entitledFree Your Mind, which debuted in October 2023 at theAviva StudiosinManchester, England.[220]See also[edit]CyberspaceDialectical materialismHenosisKnow thyselfList of films featuring hallucinogensMetaverseNineteen Eighty-FourSimulated realityThought experimentVirtual realityVirtual worldWe, novel byYevgeny ZamyatinTVThe Deadly Assassin, 1976 episode ofDoctor Whoin a virtual reality called the ""Matrix""FilmsWorld on a Wire, 1973 German science fiction seriesTron, 1982 filmStrange Days, 1995 filmDark City, 1998 filmThe Thirteenth Floor, 1999 filmExistenz, 1999 filmComputer Boy, 2000 parodyThe Meatrix, 2003 parodyCode Lyoko, 2003 French animated seriesInfinity Train, 2019 American animated seriesNotes[edit]^abcCredited asThe Wachowski Brothers^Attributed to multiple references:[119][150][151][152][153]^Attributed to multiple references:[168][169][170][171]References[edit]^""The Matrix"".British Board of Film Classification.

Warner Bros. was going for this thing where they didn't want Johnny Depp, they wanted Brad Pitt or Val Kilmer. They told Larry and Andy if Brad Pitt would do the picture, they'd green light it right then. After Kilmer and Brad Pitt said no, Warner Bros. was willing to consider Johnny Depp, so it sort of came down to between Johnny Depp and Keanu Reeves, who Warner Bros. was pushing. Keanu was always really tuned in to the concept and that made a big difference for Larry and Andy. I think it was a brilliant choice. Gary Oldman was considered as Morpheus at one point, and Samuel Jackson as well.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts ofthe sinkingofRMSTitanicin 1912. The film starsLeonardo DiCaprioandKate Winsletas members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage. The film also features anensemble castofBilly Zane,Kathy Bates,Frances Fisher,Bernard Hill,Jonathan Hyde,Danny Nucci,David Warner, andBill Paxton.Cameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination withshipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[8]when Cameron shot footage of theTitanicwreck. The modern scenes on the research vesselwere shot on board theAkademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck.Scale models,computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of theTitanicbuilt atBaja Studioswere used to recreate the sinking. The film was initially in development at20th Century Fox, but a mounting budget and being behind schedule resulted in Fox askingParamount Picturesfor financial help; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada, while Fox released the film in other territories.Titanicwas themost expensive film ever madeat the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.Titanicpremiered at theTokyo International Film Festivalon November 1, 1997, and was released in the United States on December 19. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, andGloria Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story, and emotional depth.Among other awards, it was nominated for 14Academy Awardsand won a record-tying 11, includingBest PictureandBest Director, tyingBen-Hur(1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion,Titanicwas the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It wasthe highest-grossing film of all timeuntil Cameron's next film,Avatar(2009), surpassed it in 2010. Income from the initial theatrical release, retail video, and soundtrack sales and US broadcast rights exceeded $3.2 billion.[9]A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide theatrical total to $2.264 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide afterAvatar. TheLibrary of Congressselected it for preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registryfor being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" in 2017. Widely regarded as a landmark in cinematic history, Titanic not only became a global box office phenomenon but also left a profound cultural impact across diverse regions of the world.PlotIn 1996, aboard the research vesselAkademik Mstislav Keldysh, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team explore thewreck of RMSTitanic, hoping to find a necklace known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the day theTitanicstruck an icebergandsank, resulting in about 1,500 deaths.[Note 1]After seeing a television report about the discovery,centenarianRose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, revealing herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose and her granddaughter aboard theKeldysh, where Rose recounts her experience as aTitanicpassenger.In 1912, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater boards theTitanicinSouthamptonwith her wealthy fiancé, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth, who stresses that Rose's marriage to Cal will resolve their financial problems. However, Rose is unhappy in the loveless engagement. Feeling trapped, Rose contemplates suicide by jumping from the ship's stern, but is stopped by Jack Dawson, a poor nomadic artist. Jack and Rose form a friendship, and Jack confesses his growing feelings for her. Though initially resistant, Rose realizes she has fallen in love with Jack, despite Cal's and Ruth's disapproval.Rose brings Jack to her stateroom and asks him to draw her nude wearing only the necklace. Afterward, they evade Cal's valet, Spicer Lovejoy, and have sex in a car in the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear officers discussing the severity of the situation. When Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and a mocking note she left, he arranges to frame Jack for theft by having Lovejoy plant the necklace on him. Jack is arrested and locked in themaster-at-arms' office, while Cal places the necklace in his coat pocket.As the ship begins sinking, women and children are prioritized for the lifeboats. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they return to the deck, where Cal urges Rose to board a lifeboat, claiming he and Jack will board another. He unwittingly wraps his coat, containing the necklace, around her. However, as her lifeboat is lowered, Rose jumps back onto the sinking ship, unwilling to leave Jack behind. Enraged, Cal grabs a pistol and chases them through the flooding ship, but gives up when they escape. Cal manages to secure a place on a lifeboat by pretending to be a child's father.As the ship's flooded bow sinks, the stern rises into the air, and Jack and Rose cling to the railing. The ship splits in two, and the stern sinks into the freezing water with the remaining passengers. Jack helps Rose onto floating debris and makes her promise to survive and live a full life. Jack dies fromhypothermia, but Rose is saved by a returning lifeboat, and later rescued by theRMSCarpathia. Rose remains hidden from Cal and her mother, and gives her name as Rose Dawson on her arrival in New York City.In the present, Rose reveals that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the1929 stock market crash. She tells theKeldyshcrew that Jack saved her in every possible way, and laments that her memories are all that she has left of him. Touched by her account of theTitanic, Lovett abandons his search for the necklace. Alone at night on the stern of theKeldysh, Rose, who has kept the necklace in her possession all along, drops it into the sea above the wreck. Later, as she lies in her bed, photographs on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack.[10]Aboard the pristine and undamagedTitanic, a young Rose reunites with Jack at theGrand Staircase, applauded by the passengers and crew who died in the sinking.CastFictional charactersLeonardo DiCaprio(pictured in 2002), who portrayed Jack Dawson, andKate Winslet(in 2006), who portrayed Rose DeWitt BukaterLeonardo DiCaprioas Jack Dawson. Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan fromChippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, includingParis. He wins two third-class tickets for theTitanicin a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fiancé's invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with first-class passengers for a night. Cameron's original choice for the role wasRiver Phoenix; however, he died in 1993.[11]Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, inFairview CemeteryinHalifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled ""J. Dawson"". The producers did not know of the real J. Dawson until after the film was released.[12]Kate Winsletas Rose DeWitt Bukater. Rose is a 17-year-old girl fromPhiladelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death left the family debt-ridden. Rose boardsTitanicwith Cal and Ruth as a first-class passenger and meets Jack.Billy Zaneas Cal Hockley, Rose's arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fiancé, who is the heir to aPittsburghsteel fortune. He is resentful of Rose's affection for Jack.Frances Fisheras Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's widowed mother, who arranges Rose's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life.Gloria Stuartas the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert. Rose narrates the film in aframing device.Bill Paxtonas Brock Lovett, a treasure hunter looking for the Heart of the Ocean in the wreck of theTitanicin the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking aboutTitanicfor three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.Suzy Amisas Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Calvert, Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother's romantic past with Jack Dawson.Danny Nuccias Fabrizio De Rossi, Jack's Italian best friend, who boardsTitanicwith him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when theTitanicsinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.[13]David Warneras Spicer Lovejoy, an ex-Pinkertonconstable and Cal's English valet and bodyguard. He monitors Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when theTitanicsplits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner also appeared in the 1979 TV miniseriesS.O.S. Titanic, portraying passengerLawrence Beesley.Jason Barryas Tommy Ryan, an Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.[13]Alexandrea Owens-Sarnoas Cora Cartmell, a young third-class girl who dances with Jack at the Irish party. In a deleted scene, Cora and her family drowned after they were trapped at the locked third-class gate.[13]Camilla Overbye Roosas Helga Dahl, a Norwegian immigrant and third-class passenger who falls in love with Fabrizio. While most of her scenes were cut and the secondary significance of her character was drastically reduced from the original screenplay to the final theatrical cut, Helga is most notably seen clinging onto the rail of the ship's stern with Jack and Rose before slipping into the frigid waters below.[14][15]Amy Gaipaas Trudy Bolt, Rose's personal maid.[13]Historical charactersAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[16]the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:The real Margaret Brown (right) providing CaptainArthur Henry Rostronwith an award for his service in the rescue ofTitanic's surviving passengersKathy BatesasMargaret ""Molly"" Brown. Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as ""vulgar"" and ""new money"". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed the Unsinkable Molly Brown by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeeredLifeboat 6from QuartermasterRobert Hichens.[17]Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film.Victor GarberasThomas Andrews, the ship's builder. Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a ""mathematical certainty"" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during thesinking of the shipas standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of theTitanic, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder) and thereafter perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40 a.m.[18]There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.[18]It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts; then he continued assisting with the evacuation.[18]Crew of theOlympic, 1911. Left:First Officer William M. Murdoch. Right:Captain Edward J. Smith.Bernard HillasCaptain Edward John Smith.[19]Smith planned to make theTitanichis final voyage before retiring. He retreats into thewheelhouseon thebridgeas the ship sinks, dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat B.[20]Jonathan HydeasJ. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line's ignorant, boorish managing director. With the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention, Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster; although this situation appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.[21][22]After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his ""unsinkable"" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children drowned.Eric BraedenasJohn Jacob Astor IV, a first-class passenger and the richest man on the ship. In the film, Rose introduces Jack to Astor and his 18-year-old wife,Madeleine(Charlotte Chatton), in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks whether Jack is connected to the ""Boston Dawsons"", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with theChippewa FallsDawsons. Astor is last seen as the glass dome over the Grand Staircase implodes and water surges in.Bernard FoxasColonel Archibald Gracie IV. The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that ""women and machinery don't mix"" and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, unaware that Jack saved Rose from asuicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox portrayedFrederick Fleetin the 1958 filmA Night to Remember.Michael EnsignasBenjamin Guggenheim, a mining magnate traveling in first class. He shows off his French mistress, Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett), to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the first-class passengers for dinner after rescuing Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a ""bohemian"". Guggenheim is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.Wallace Hartley,Titanic's bandmaster and violinistJonathan Evans-Jones asWallace Hartley, the ship's bandmaster and violinist, who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"", to the tune of Bethany,[23][24]and dies in the sinking.Mark Lindsay ChapmanasChief Officer Henry Wilde,[19]the ship's chief officer, who lets Cal board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, leading to her rescue.Ewan StewartasFirst Officer William Murdoch,[19]the officer in charge of the bridge when theTitanicstruck an iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic and then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal, seeing it as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.[25]A few months later, Fox vice president Scott Neeson went toDalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology and also presented a £5000 donation toDalbeattie High Schoolto boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.[26]Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the""women and children first"" policy.[27]According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an ""honorable man,"" not of a man ""gone bad"" or of a ""cowardly murderer."" He added, ""I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.""[28]Jonathan PhillipsasSecond Officer Charles Lightoller.[19]Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. In the film, Lightoller informs Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water and, after the collision, suggests that the crew begin boarding women and children in the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to survive the disaster.Film producer Kevin De La Noy asThird Officer Herbert Pitman,[19]who survived the sinking and mannedLifeboat 5Simon CraneasFourth Officer Joseph Boxhall,[19]the officer in charge of firing flares and manningLifeboat 2during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.Ioan GruffuddasFifth Officer Harold Lowe,[19]the only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.Edward Fletcher asSixth Officer James Moody,[19]the only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.James LancasterasFather Thomas Byles, a second-class passenger and a Catholic priest from England. He is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.Lew PalterandElsa RavenasIsidorandIda Straus. Isidor is a former owner ofR.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, the couple were offered seats on a lifeboat together. Isidor refused to go before all women and children have been evacuated, and urged his wife Ida to go ahead. Ida is portrayed refusing to board the lifeboat, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed, embracing each other as water fills their stateroom; the real Isidor and Ida Straus were also seen in an embrace but were actually seated on chairs in the A Deck before being swept by waves as the ship made its final plunge.Martin JarvisasSir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, a Scottish baronet who is rescued inLifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the ""women and children first"" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of theTitanicwas almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. TheBritish Board of Trade's inquiry into the disasteraccepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.[29][30]Rosalind AyresasLady Duff-Gordon, a world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo's wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat's crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.[31][32][33]Jarvis and Ayres were husband and wife in real life.Rochelle Rose asNoël Leslie, Countess of Rothes. The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.Scott G. Anderson asFrederick Fleet, the lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.Paul BrightwellasQuartermaster Robert Hichens, one of the six quartermasters and at the ship's wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge oflifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.Martin East asReginald Lee, the other lookout in thecrow's nest. He survives the sinking.Gregory CookeasJack Phillips, the senior wireless operator whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.Craig KellyasHarold Bride, a junior wireless operator.Liam TuohyasChief Baker Charles Joughin. The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship's stern, and finally hanging onto the ship's railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.[34]In a deleted scene, he's shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.[35][36]Terry ForrestalasChief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked throughout the sinking to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. The film portrays Bell and all of the engineers as having died in the bowels of theTitanic, however there is evidence to suggest that at least some of the engineers were released to come on deck when the flooding became severe. Greaser Frederick Scott testified to seeing eight engineers between approximately 1:50 and 1:55 a.m. standing up against the electric crane on the starboard Boat Deck; by then, all the lifeboats had gone.[37]CameosSeveral crew members of theAkademik Mstislav Keldyshappear, includingAnatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of theMirself-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[38]Van Lingportrayed real-life Chinese survivor Fang Lang; his backstory inspired Cameron to produce a documentaryThe Six, based on a group of Chinese survivors who survived the sinking.[39]Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for theTitanicHistorical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin;Edward Kamudaand Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[40][41]ProductionPre-production, inspiration and writingDirector, writer and producerJames Cameron(pictured in 2000)The story could not have been written better had it been fiction...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, thegender rolesplayed out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable... the unthinkable possible.—James Cameron[42][43]James Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for himTitanicwas ""theMount Everestof shipwrecks"".[44][45][46]He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had ""a mental restlessness"" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. When anIMAXfilm,Titanica, was made from footage shot of theTitanicwreck, Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition. It was ""not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,"" Cameron said. ""I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.""[44]Cameron wrote ascriptmentfor aTitanicfilm,[47]met with20th Century Foxexecutives includingPeter Chernin, and pitched it as ""Romeo and Julieton theTitanic"".[45][46]Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential, and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films.[48]They approved the project as they hoped for a long-term relationship with Cameron.[48][49][50]Cameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting theTitanicwreck,[47]and organized several dives over a period of two years.[42]He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes, instead of simulating it with special effects, would provide value: ""We can either do [the shots] with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.""[45]The crew shot at the wreck in theAtlantic Ocean12 times in 1995. The work was risky, as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure.[49]Additionally, adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage.[49]During one dive, one of the submersibles collided withTitanic's hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of the captain's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior, and the area around the entrance to theGrand Staircasewas damaged.[51]Descending to the site emphasized to the crew that theTitanicdisaster was not simply a story of fiction, but a real event with real loss of life. Cameron said: ""Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it."" He felt a ""great mantle of responsibility"" to convey the emotional message of the story, as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck.[50]Cameron felt theTitanicsinking was ""like a great novel that really happened"", but that the event had become a meremorality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[42]The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy.[38]He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[42]He said: ""All my films are love stories, but inTitanicI finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.""[50]After filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[47]He wanted to honor the people who died, and spent six months researching theTitanic's crew and passengers.[42]He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts.[45]From the beginning of the shoot, the team had ""a very clear picture"" of what happened on the ship. Cameron said, ""That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.""[45]Cameron was influenced by the 1958 British film about theTitanic,A Night to Remember, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage,[52]and themusicians playing on the deckduring the sinking.[16]Cameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[42]While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film,[53][54]Cameron said, ""The answer has to be something you supply personally, individually.""[10]Scale modelingThe reconstruction ofTitanic. The blueprints were supplied by the original ship's builder and Cameron tried to make the ship as detailed and accurate as possible.[55][56]Harland & Wolff,Titanic'sbuilders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designerPeter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[55]Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south ofPlayas de Rosaritoin Mexico and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. Ahorizon tankof 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on thesuperstructureand forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architectJay Kantolausing plans of theTitanic'ssister shipRMSOlympic.[56]Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) ofrail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[38]The sets representing the interior rooms of theTitanicwere reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from theTitanic'sbuilders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plasterwork based onTitanic'soriginal designs.[57]The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with theWhite Star Linecrest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[58]Cameron hired twoTitanichistorians,Don LynchandKen Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail.[49]CastingCameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on theTitanic, to relive its liveliness, and ""to take that energy and give it to Jack, ... an artist who is able to have his heart soar"".[59]Though established actors likeMatthew McConaughey,Chris O'Donnell,Billy Crudup, andStephen Dorffwere considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old.[48][49]Tom Cruisewas interested, but hisasking pricewas too high.[49]Cameron consideredJared Letofor the role, but Leto refused to audition.[60]Jeremy Sistodid a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose.[61]DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn.[48]Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene. Cameron said, ""He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest."" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, ""Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want."" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played byJames StewartorGregory Peck.[48][62]Cameron said Winslet ""had the thing that you look for"" and that there was ""a quality in her face, in her eyes"" that he ""just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her"".[59]Winslet said of her character, ""She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that's not going to happen.""[59]Gwyneth Paltrow,Winona Ryder,Claire Danes(who had worked with DiCaprio inRomeo + Julietthe previous year),Gabrielle Anwar, andReese Witherspoonwere considered for the role.[48][63][64][65]When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her toHollywoodfor auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting directorMali Finnoriginally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as ""anAudrey Hepburntype"". He was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after herscreen testimpressed him.[48]After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him that she whispered to Cameron, ""He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him."" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, ""From Your Rose"", and lobbied him by phone. ""You don't understand!"" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in hisHumvee. ""I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!"" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.[48]Cameron initially consideredMichael Biehnfor the role of Cal Hockley, whom he had previously collaborated with onThe Terminator,Aliens, andThe Abyss, for the role,[66]before offering it to Matthew McConaughey,[49]andRob Lowesaid he pursued it.[67]Cameron stated, of the role of the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert ""In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.""[59]The 101-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the Heart of the Ocean after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87,Gloria Stuarthad to be made up to look older for the role.[49]Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, ""My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from theGolden Age of the thirties and forties.""[50]Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was.Fay Wraywas also considered for the role, but Cameron said, ""[Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet's] spirit. I saw thisjoie de vivrein both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person.""[50]Reba McEntirewas offered the role ofMargaret Brown, but had to turn it down because it conflicted with her touring schedule.[68]FilmingPrincipal photographybegan on July 31, 1996[8]atDartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard theAkademik Mstislav Keldysh.[38]In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built FoxBaja StudiosinRosarito, Mexico, where a full-scaleTitanichad been constructed.[38]Thepoop deckwas built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[69]For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[70]By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[69]Cameron built hisTitanicon thestarboardside as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure fromSouthampton, as it was docked on itsportside. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[71]A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[49]Despite this, several critics notedanachronismsin the film.[72][73]Cameron's sketch of Rose wearing the Heart of the Ocean. The scene was one of the first shot, as the main set was not ready.[50]Cameron sketched Jack's portrait of Rose; Winslet posed in a bathing suit.[74][75]Cameron felt the scene had a backdrop of repression and freedom: ""You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,"" he said.[74][50]The sketching scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. ""It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,"" Cameron stated. ""They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot."" Cameron said he and his crew ""were just trying to find things to shoot"" because the big set ""wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.""  Cameron felt the final scene worked well.[50]The shoot was an arduous experience that ""cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood"". He became known as an ""uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist"" and a ""300-decibel screamer, a modern-dayCaptain Blighwith a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane"".[76]Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship would sink. ""There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,"" she said.[76]""'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'That's exactly what I didn't want!'""[76]Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience, and said: ""There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds.""[76]The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him ""Mij"" (Jim spelled backwards).[76]In response to the criticism, Cameron said, ""Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.""[76]More than 800 crew members worked on the film.[77]On August 9, 1996, during theAkademik Mstislav Keldyshshoot in Canada, an unknown person, suspected to be a crew member, put thedissociativedrugPCPinto the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night inDartmouth, Nova Scotia.[48][78]It sent more than 50 people to the hospital.[78]Paxton and Cameron ate the soup and went to the hospital but Paxton decided to leave, telling Cameron ""Jim, I'm not gonna hang out here, this is bedlam. I'm gonna ... wander back down to the set and just drink a case of beer.""[79]""There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks andpsychedelics,"" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[48]Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. ""One eye was completely red, like theTerminatoreye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd beensniffing gluesince he was four.""[48][76]The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and theHalifax Regional Police Serviceannounced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999.[80]The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[53][81]The filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (filming officially wrapped on March 23, 1997).[8]Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned ""a lot of money"".[81]Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but theScreen Actors Guilddecided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[81]Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[82]Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[81]The costs of filmingTitanicballooned and eventually reached $200 million,[4][5][6]a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time.[83]Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors winOscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, ""You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!""[48]The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment. The executives initially rejected Cameron's offer to forfeit his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[48]Worried about the mounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film. Fox first approachedUniversal Picturesas they had picked up the international distribution rights to Cameron'sTrue Lies(1994) when production costs began to mount; however Universal would turn Fox down. Instead, Fox andParamount Picturescame together in May 1996 following the success both studios had collaborating on the distribution forMel Gibson'sBraveheart(1995), and ultimately agreed to co-finance the film together and split the distribution rights.[84]In an effort to recoup their $135 million investment, Fox sold the domestic rights to the film to Paramount in return for Paramount providing Fox an additional $65 million for production, while retaining international rights; Fox however would still be responsible for any further budget overruns going forward, but also retain all profits from any merchandise sold based on the film as part of the deal with Paramount.[85][86]Cameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. ""...the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more thanT2andTrue Lies.Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget.Titanicalso had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,"" he said. ""As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.""[50]Amidst the film's successful box office run, a Fox executive, William Mechanic, commented that ""Jim Cameron told us we could have an expensive bad movie or a more expensive potentially great movie. We made our judgment. And we made the best choice.""[87]In July 2024, Cameron stated that it was actually co-producerJon Landauwho ""bore the brunt of the studio pressure"" whenTitanicwas being made.[88]According to Cameron, Landau ""gave his all to provide the time and resources for me to make the film I saw in my head.""[88]Post-productionEffectsCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlistedDigital DomainandPacific Data Imagesto continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered onThe AbyssandTerminator 2: Judgment Day. Many previous films aboutTitanicshot water inslow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[89]Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m)miniatureof the ship as if ""we're making a commercial for the White Star Line"".[90]Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on amotion capturestage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[89]For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of theSSJeremiah O'Brien'sengines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against agreenscreen.[91]In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[92]The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[93]Unlike previousTitanicfilms, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.An enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000 L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000 L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227 m) exterior ofTitanichad its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as ashock absorberagainst the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett'sROVtraversing the wreck in the present.[38]The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000 L) tank,[94]where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[55]The climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previousTitanicfilms for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He ""wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was"".[49]When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt artists resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized ""by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls"".[49]ALinux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.[95]EditingCameron said there were aspects of theTitanicstory that seemed important in pre- and post-production but became less important as the film evolved. He omitted theSSCalifornian, the ship that was close to theTitanicthe night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew'sSOScalls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving theCalifornianwas cut, according to Cameron, ""because it focuses you back onto that world. IfTitanicis powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained."" He said its omission was not ""a compromise to mainstream filmmaking"" but ""about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film"".[50]During the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the ending. In the original version, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it, to live on her own without Cal's money. She allows Brock to hold it but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after theTitanic'ssinking.[96]Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary, saying ""I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better... Our job was done by then... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need.""[97]The version used for the firsttest screeningfeatured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon.[98]The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window; this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film. Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[98]Heart of the Ocean""Heart of the Ocean"" redirects here. For other uses, seeHeart of the Ocean (disambiguation).For the Heart of the Ocean design, London-based jewelersAsprey & Garrardusedcubic zirconiasset in white gold[99]to create anEdwardian-style necklace to be used as a prop in the film. The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.[citation needed]The third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success,Asprey & Garrardwere commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2 g) heart-shaped Ceylonsapphiresurrounded by 103 diamonds.[99]This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated toSotheby'sauction house inBeverly Hillsfor an auction benefiting theDiana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fundand Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client[100]for $1.4 million (equivalent to $2.7 million in 2024), under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the1998 Academy Awardsceremony. Since then, this necklace has not been made available for public viewing.[citation needed]SoundtrackMain articles:Titanic: Music from the Motion PictureandBack to TitanicCameron wroteTitanicwhile listening to the work of the Irish new-age musicianEnya.[101]After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film,[102]Cameron instead choseJames Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience onAliens,[103]butTitaniccemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death.[104]For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singerSissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as ""Sissel"". Horner knew Sissel from her albumInnerst i sjelen, and particularly liked how she sang ""Eg veit i himmerik ei borg"" (""I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle""). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.[105]Horner wrote the end theme, ""My Heart Will Go On"", in secret withWill Jenningsbecause Cameron did not want any songs in the film.[106]Céline Dionagreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husbandRené Angélil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for ""going commercial at the end of the movie"".[106]Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and ""saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion"".[49]The soundtrack was the best-selling album of 1998 with sales of over 27 million.[9]ReleaseTheatricalDistribution forTitanicwas split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handling the domestic distribution, and Fox handling the foreign release.[84]Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997.[107]The film was to be released on this date ""to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better"".[49]In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible.[49]The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, butHarrison Ford, whose filmAir Force Onewas to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrativeIndiana JonesandJack Ryanfranchises, that he would never work with them again if they releasedTitanicso close to his own film.[108]On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[77]The film's new release date would be shared byTomorrow Never DiesandMouse Hunt.[109]""This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster."" A preview screening inMinneapolison July 14 ""generated positive reviews"" and ""[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]"". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[49]Cameron refused to hold the film'sworld premierein Los Angeles.[86]Paramount disagreed with Cameron's decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at theTokyo International Film Festival,[110][86]where reaction was described as ""tepid"" byThe New York Times.[111]Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where ""the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media"".[49]Home mediaTitanicwas released worldwide inwidescreenandpan and scanformats onVHSon September 1, 1998.[112]There are two separate cassettes on this release, as the film is divided into two parts.[113]More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film.[114]Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming thebest selling live-action video, beatingIndependence Day.[9]In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outsellingThe Lion Kingfor a total worldwide revenue of $995 million.[9]By March 2005, the film has sold 8 millionDVDand 59 million VHS units.[115]In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed byHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stonein May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day.[116]The film would also remain as the fastest-selling DVD in the United Kingdom untilMamma Mia!took it in 2008.[117]Within the first week of release,Titanicquickly beatThe Full Monty, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies.[118]NBCacquired the US television broadcast rights for $30 million, which was considered a bargain.[9]A DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than atheatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[119]At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. ""When we released the originalTitanicDVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,"" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[119]Titanicwas re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-discSpecial Collector's Editionwas made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1DTS-ES Discretesurround sound mix and various special features. InPALregions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as theSpecial EditionandDeluxe Collector's Editionrespectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the titleDeluxe Limited Edition, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentaryGhosts of the Abyss, which was distributed byWalt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release ofGhosts of the Abyss, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[120]In 2007, for the film's tenth anniversary, a10th Anniversary Editionwas released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.[121]The film was released byParamount Home EntertainmentonBlu-rayandBlu-ray 3Don September 10, 2012.[122]The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is alsoTHX-certified.

By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead ofMouse Hunt,Scream 2andTomorrow Never Dies. It would go on to surpassThe Godfather Part III's record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassingScream 2.[148]By New Year's Day,Titanichad made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held byJurassic Park, which took 67 days to do so.[149]Titanicwould hold this record until 1999 when it was taken byStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.[150]Additionally, the film reached the $400 million mark within 66 days, which was the fastest at the time, a record that would be matched bySpider-Manin 2002.[151]Both films would remain so until they were surpassed in 2004 byShrek 2.[152]Titanic's highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[153][154]On March 14, it surpassedStar Warsas the highest-grossing film ever in North America.[155]It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[156]By April 1998, the film's number one spot would be overtaken byLost in Space, dropping into second place.[157]The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188,[158]equivalent to $1176.8 million in 2024[159]. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[160]and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[161]Commercial analysisBeforeTitanic's release, various film critics predicted the film would be asignificant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.[76][162][163][120]When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, ""it was with massive forebodings"", since the ""people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this greatalbatrossof a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making"".[163]Cameron also thought he was ""headed for disaster"" at one point during filming. ""We labored the last six months onTitanicin the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,"" he stated.[76]As the film neared release, ""particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance"". A film critic for theLos Angeles Timeswrote that ""Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project"" and that the film was ""a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances"".[76]It's hard to forget the director on the stage of theShrine Auditoriumin LA, exultant, pumping a golden Oscar statuette into the air and shouting: ""I'm the king of the world!"" As everyone knew, that was the most famous line inTitanic, exclaimed by Leonardo DiCaprio's character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel. Cameron's incantation of the line was a giant ""eff off"", in front of a television audience approaching a billion, to all the naysayers, especially those sitting right in front of him.—Christopher Goodwin ofThe Timeson Cameron's response toTitanic'scriticism[76]When the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[162]The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[163]and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends,[164]and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays.[163]20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seenTitanictwice by its fifth week.[165]Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused ""Leo-Mania"" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[166]other reports have attributed the film's success to positiveword of mouthand repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[164][167]The Hollywood Reporterestimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4 billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4 billion after ancillary sources.[168]Titanic's impact on men has also been especially credited.[169][170][171]It is considered one of the films that make men cry,[169][170]withMSNBC's Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack's sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack.[169]The film's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 filmZombieland, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: ""I haven't cried like that sinceTitanic.""[172]Scott Meslow ofThe Atlanticstated whileTitanicinitially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film ""for 15-year-old girls"" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissingTitanicas fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: ""that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys."" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films likeIron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny likingTitanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. ""It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make)Titanican irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,"" he stated. ""Titanichas flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.""[171]Quotes in the film aided its popularity.Titanic'scatchphrase ""I'm the king of the world!"" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[173][174]According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor atKansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. ""People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh"", he said.[174]Cameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. ""When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,"" he said. ""They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's howTitanicworked.""[175]Media Awareness Networkstated, ""The normal
repeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate forTitanicwas over 20%.""[49]The box office receipts ""were even more impressive"" when factoring in ""the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings"". In response to this, ""[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am"".[49]Titanicheld the record for box office gross for 12 years.[176]Cameron's follow-up film,Avatar, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[177][178]and did so in 2010.[139]Various explanationsfor why the film was able to successfully challengeTitanicwere given. For one, ""Two-thirds ofTitanic'shaul was earned overseas, andAvatar[tracked] similarly...Avataropened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them"" and the markets ""such as Russia, whereTitanicsaw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today"" with ""more screens and moviegoers"" than ever before.[179]Brandon Gray, president ofBox Office Mojo, said that whileAvatarmay beatTitanic'srevenue record, the film is unlikely to surpassTitanicin attendance. ""Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.""[177]In December 2009, Cameron had stated, ""I don't think it's realistic to try to toppleTitanicoff its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years.Titanicjust struck some kind of chord.""[164]In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter onceAvatar'sperformance was easier to predict, saying ""It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,"".[178]Author Alexandra Keller, when analyzingTitanic's success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity ""appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns ofconsumerismandglobalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s – awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.""[180]Critical responseInitialTitanicgarnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts.[180][181][182]Onreview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 255 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashionedmelodrama.""[167]Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has ""generally favorable reviews"".[183]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare ""A+"" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.[184]With regard to the film's overall design,Roger Ebertstated: ""It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well."" He credited the ""technical difficulties"" with being ""so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion"" and ""found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga"".[185]He named it his ninth-best film of 1997.[186]On the television programSiskel & Ebert, the film received ""two thumbs up"" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as ""a glorious Hollywood epic"" and ""well worth the wait,"" andGene Siskelfound Leonardo DiCaprio ""captivating"".[187]James Berardinellistated: ""Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent,Titanicis the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watchTitanic, you experience it.""[188]It was named his second best film of 1997.[189]Joseph McBride ofBoxoffice Magazineconcluded: ""To describeTitanicas the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.""[190]The romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban ofUrban Cinefilesaid: ""You will walk out ofTitanicnot talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.""[191]Owen GleibermanofEntertainment Weeklydescribed the film as ""a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.""[190]Janet MaslinofThe New York Timescommented that ""Cameron's magnificentTitanicis the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison toGone With the Wind.""[190]Adrian Turner ofRadio Timesawarded it four stars out of five, stating ""Cameron's script wouldn't have sustainedClark GableandVivien Leighfor 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours.Titanicis a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesomealbatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.""[192]Titanicsuffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak.[182]Richard CorlissofTimemagazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[193]Kenneth Turan's review in theLos Angeles Timeswas particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, ""What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.""[194]He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[195]Barbara Shulgasser ofThe San Francisco ExaminergaveTitanicone star out of four, citing a friend as saying, ""The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.""[196]RetrospectiveAccording to Dalin Rowell of/Film, ""With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature,Titanicis no stranger to modern-day criticism.""[197]In 2002, filmmakerRobert Altmancalled it ""the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life"".[198]Similarly,French New Wavedirector and formerCahiers du CinémaeditorJacques Rivettereferred to it as ""garbage"" in a 1998 interview withFrédéric Bonnaudand was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was ""unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.""[199]In 2003, the film topped a poll of ""Best Film Endings"",[200]but it also topped a poll byFilm 2003as ""the worst movie of all time"".[201]In his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on theTitanic, historianRichard Davenport-Hinessaid, ""Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it maderomantic heroesof the poor Irish and the unlettered.""[202]The British film magazineEmpirereduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[203]In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[204]Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. ""What really irks me...,"" he said, ""are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it."" Willcock stated, ""I obviously don't have anything against those who dislikeTitanic, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.""[120]In 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular, by writing ""Titanicis not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion."" Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were ""celebrating their own essential humanity"" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally ""incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric"" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing witharchetypes. He did not see it as pandering. ""Turan mistakes archetype for cliché,"" he said. ""I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.""[205]In 2000, Almar Haflidason of theBBCwrote that ""the critical knives were out long before James Cameron'sTitanicwas complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong."" He added that ""the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy"" and that ""when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron"".[206]Empireeventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: ""It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron'sTitanicat approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.""[207]In 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressas being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[208]The same year, Cameron reviewed the accuracy of the film for theNational GeographicprogramTitanic: 20 Years Later with James Cameron.[209][210]The film's climax has sparked many debates over the years on whether both Jack and Rose should have been able to fit on the floating door and survive, becoming among the most talked about aspects of the film.[211]While at the time of the film's 20th anniversary Cameron stated that it was ""kind of silly, really, that we’re having this discussion 20 years later,""[212]in 2023 he conducted a study for the film's 25th anniversary that aired as part of an updated National Geographic retrospective, which suggested it was possible but unlikely and depended on numerous variables.[213][214], after a previous test  had been conducted in 2012 byMythBusters.[215][216]It was listed among the 100 best films in anEmpirepoll and in a later poll of members of the film industry.[217][218]In 2021, Dalin Rowell of/Filmranked it the third-best film of Cameron's career, stating that it is ""easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds"", and considering it ""a legitimately remarkable achievement — one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way,Titanicdemonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.""[197]In 2024,Looperranked it number 44 on its list of the ""50 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time,"" writingCameron's immersive visuals, achieved using groundbreaking special effects, transport viewers back in time to the opulence of the Titanic and the heart-wrenching chaos of its final hours. The sheer grandness of the film, combined with its tragic tale, pushed the boundaries of storytelling and visual effects, paving the way for future blockbusters.[219]OtherIn 1998, Chinese PresidentJiang Zeminpraised the film during an address to theNational People's Congressin order to demonstrate his endorsement of Western cultural imports.[220]AccoladesMain article:List of accolades received byTitanicAt theGolden Globes,TitanicwonBest Motion Picture – Drama,Best Director,Best Original Score, andBest Original Song.[221]Winslet and Stuart were also nominated.[222]At the70th Academy Awards,Titanicgarnered fourteenAcademy Awardnominations, tying the record set in 1950 byJoseph L.

TheTitanic3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[240]The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.[241]Digital 2D and in 2DIMAXversions were also struck from the new4Kmastercreated in the process.[242]The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including theMilky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by the astrophysicistNeil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[243]An accurate view of theMilky Waywas used to replace Rose's view of the moonless night sky at sea, as in this photo fromParanal Observatory. The view was adjusted to match the North Atlantic at 4:20 am on April 15, 1912.The 3D version ofTitanicpremiered at theRoyal Albert Hallin London on March 27, 2012, withJames CameronandKate Winsletin attendance,[244][245]and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days before the centenary ofTitanicembarking on her maiden voyage.[246][247][248]Rolling Stonefilm criticPeter Traversrated the reissue3+1⁄2stars out of 4, explaining he found it ""pretty damn dazzling"". He said, ""The 3D intensifiesTitanic. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.""[249]Writing forEntertainment Weekly,Owen Gleibermangave the film an A grade. He wrote, ""For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.""[250]Richard CorlissofTime, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: ""I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged."" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the ""careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.""[251]Ann Hornaday forThe Washington Postfound herself asking ""whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't."" She added that the ""3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.""[252]The film grossed an estimated $4.7 million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3 million over the weekend, finishing in third place behindThe Hunger GamesandAmerican Reunion.[253][254]Outside North America it earned $35.2 million, finishing second,[255]and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9 million.[256]China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6 million on its opening day,[257]going on to earn a record-breaking $67 million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[256]The reissue earned $343.4 million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8 million from Canada and the United States.[258]With a worldwide box office of nearly $350 million, the 3D re-release ofTitanicremains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead ofThe Lion King,Star Wars, andAvatar.[259]The 3D conversion of the film was also released in the4DXformat in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting, and scent-based special effects.[260][261][262]20th anniversaryFor the 20th anniversary of the film,Titanicwas re-released in cinemas inDolby Vision(in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[263]25th anniversaryTitanicwas re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically andWalt Disney Studios Motion Pictures(through the20th Century StudiosandBuena Vista Internationallabels) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D4K HDRrender, withhigh frame rate, as part of the film's 25th anniversary.

It is based on thehistorical novelSchindler's Ark(1982) byThomas Keneally. The film followsOskar Schindler, a German industrialist who saved more than a thousand mostlyPolish–Jewishrefugees fromthe Holocaustby employing them in his factories duringWorld War II. It starsLiam Neesonas Schindler,Ralph FiennesasSSofficerAmon Göth, andBen Kingsleyas Schindler's Jewish accountantItzhak Stern.Ideas for a film about theSchindlerjuden(Schindler Jews) were proposed as early as 1963.Poldek Pfefferberg, one of theSchindlerjuden, made it his life's mission to tell Schindler's story. Spielberg became interested when executiveSidney Sheinbergsent him a book review ofSchindler's Ark.Universal Picturesbought the rights to the novel, but Spielberg, unsure if he was ready to make a film about the Holocaust, tried to pass the project to several directors before deciding to direct it himself.Principal photographytook place inKraków, Poland, over 72 days in 1993. Spielberg shot inblack and whiteand approached the film as a documentary. CinematographerJanusz Kamińskiwanted to create a sense of timelessness.John Williamscomposed the score, and violinistItzhak Perlmanperformed the main theme.Schindler's Listpremiered on November 30, 1993, inWashington, D.C., and was released on December 15, 1993 in the United States. The film received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for the performances of Neeson and Fiennes, Williams' musical score, Kaminski's cinematography, Zaillian's screenplay, and Spielberg's direction. It was a box office success, earning $322.2 million worldwide on a $22 million budget.Schindler's Listearned multiple accolades, including sevenAcademy Awards(includingBest Picture), sevenBAFTAsand threeGolden Globes. It is often listed as one of thegreatest films ever made.[4][5][6]The film was deemed ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"" by theLibrary of Congressin 2004 and selected for preservation in the U.S.National Film Registry. In 2007, theAmerican Film InstituterankedSchindler's List8th on itslist of the 100 greatest American films.[7]Plot[edit]In German-occupiedKrakówduringWorld War II, theNazisforce localPolish Jewsinto the overcrowdedKraków Ghetto.Oskar Schindler, a GermanNazi Partymember fromCzechoslovakia, arrives in the city, hoping to make his fortune. He bribesWehrmacht(German armed forces) andSSofficials, acquiringa factoryto produceenamelware. Schindler hiresItzhak Stern, a Jewish official with contacts amongblack marketeersand the Jewish business community; he handles administration and helps Schindler arrange financing. Stern ensures that as many Jewish workers as possible were deemed essential to the German war effort to prevent them from being taken by the SS toconcentration campsor killed. Meanwhile, Schindler maintains friendly relations with the Nazis and enjoys his new wealth and status as an industrialist.SS-Untersturmführer(second lieutenant)Amon Götharrives in Kraków to oversee construction of thePłaszów concentration camp. When the camp is ready, he orders the ghetto liquidated: two thousand Jews are transported to Płaszów, and two thousand others are killed in the streets by the SS. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a young girl in a red coat who hides from the Nazis and later sees her body on a wagonload of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and continues to enjoy SS support, mostly through bribery. Göth brutalizes his Jewish maid, Helen Hirsch, and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa; the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp at his factory.As the Germans begin losing the war, Göth is ordered to ship the remaining Jews at Płaszów toAuschwitz concentration camp. Schindler asks Göth for permission to move his workers to amunitions factoryhe plans to build inBrünnlitznear his hometown ofZwittau. Göth reluctantly agrees but charges a huge bribe. Schindler and Stern prepare a list of people to be transferred to Brünnlitz instead of Auschwitz. The list eventually includes 1,100 names.As the Jewish workers are transported by train to Brünnlitz, the women and girls are mistakenly redirected to Auschwitz-Birkenau; Schindler bribesRudolf Höss, the commandant of Auschwitz, for their release. At the new factory, Schindler forbids the SS guards from entering the production area without permission and encourages the Jews to observe theSabbath. Over the next seven months, he spends his fortune bribing Nazi officials and buying shell casings from other companies. Due to Schindler's machinations, the factory produces no usable armaments. He runs out of money in 1945, just as Germany surrenders.As a Nazi Party member and war profiteer, Schindler must flee the advancingRed Armyto avoid capture. The SS guards at the factory have been ordered to kill the Jewish workforce, but Schindler persuades them not to do so. Bidding farewell to his workers, he prepares to head west, hoping to surrender to the Americans. The workers give him a signed statement attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives and present him with a ring engraved with aTalmudicparaphrase: ""Whoever saves one life saves the world entire"". Schindler breaks down in tears, feeling he should have done more, and is comforted by the workers before he and his wife leave in their car.

Pfefferberg attempted to produce abiopicof Oskar Schindler withMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) in 1963, withHoward Kochwriting, but the deal fell through.[9][10]In 1982, Thomas Keneally published his historical novelSchindler's Ark, which he wrote after a chance meeting with Pfefferberg in Los Angeles in 1980.[11]MCApresidentSid Sheinbergsent director Steven Spielberg aNew York Timesreview of the book. Spielberg, astounded by Schindler's story, jokingly asked if it was true. ""I was drawn to it because of the paradoxical nature of the character,"" he said. ""What would drive a man like this to suddenly take everything he had earned and put it all in the service of saving these lives?""[12]Spielberg expressed enough interest for Universal Pictures to buy the rights to the novel.[12]At their first meeting in spring 1983, he told Pfefferberg he would start filming in ten years.[13]In the end credits of the film, Pfefferberg is credited as a consultant under the name Leopold Page.[14]The liquidation of theKraków Ghettoin March 1943 is the subject of a 15-minute segment of the film.Spielberg was unsure if he was mature enough to make a film about the Holocaust, and the project remained ""on [his] guilty conscience"".[13]Spielberg tried to pass the project to directorRoman Polanski, but he refused Spielberg's offer. Polanski's mother was killed at Auschwitz, and he had lived in and survived the Kraków Ghetto.[13]Polanski eventually directed his own Holocaust dramaThe Pianist(2002). Spielberg also offered the film toSydney PollackandMartin Scorsese, who was attached to directSchindler's Listin 1988. However, Spielberg was unsure of letting Scorsese direct the film, as  ""I'd given away a chance to do something for my children and family about the Holocaust.""[15]Spielberg offered him the chance to direct the1991 remake ofCape Fearinstead.[16]Scorsese would later admit in an interview that while he believed his version of the film might've been good, he had no regrets passing it to Spielberg stating that ""it would not have been the hit that it became"".[17]Billy Wilderexpressed an interest in directing the film as a memorial to his family, most of whom were murdered in the Holocaust.[18]Brian De Palmaalso refused an offer to direct.[19]Spielberg finally decided to take on the project when he noticed thatHolocaust denierswere being given serious consideration by the media. With the rise ofneo-Nazismafter the fall of theBerlin Wall, he worried that people were too accepting of intolerance, as they were in the 1930s.[18]Sid Sheinberg greenlit the film on condition that Spielberg madeJurassic Parkfirst. Spielberg later said, ""He knew that once I had directedSchindlerI wouldn't be able to doJurassic Park.""[2]The picture was assigned a small budget of $22 million, as Holocaust films are not usually profitable.[20][2]Spielberg forwent a salary for the film, calling it ""blood money"",[2]and believed it would fail.[2]In 1983, Keneally was hired to adapt his book, and he turned in a 220-page script. His adaptation focused on Schindler's numerous relationships, and Keneally admitted he did not compress the story enough. Spielberg hiredKurt Luedtke, who had adapted the screenplay ofOut of Africa, to write the next draft. Luedtke gave up almost four years later, as he found Schindler's change of heart too unbelievable.[15]During his time as director, Scorsese hiredSteven Zaillianto write a script. When he was handed back the project, Spielberg found Zaillian's 115-page draft too short, and asked him to extend it to 195 pages. Spielberg wanted more focus on the Jews in the story, and he wanted Schindler's transition to be gradual and ambiguous instead of a sudden breakthrough or epiphany. He also extended the ghetto liquidation sequence, as he ""felt very strongly that the sequence had to be almost unwatchable.""[15]Casting[edit]Liam Neeson auditioned as Schindler early on in the film's development. He was cast in December 1992 after Spielberg saw him perform inAnna ChristieonBroadway.[21]Warren Beattyparticipated in a script reading, but Spielberg was concerned that he could not disguise his accent and that he would bring ""movie star baggage"".[22]Kevin CostnerandMel Gibsonexpressed interest in portraying Schindler, but Spielberg preferred to cast the relatively unknown Neeson so that the actor's star quality would not overpower the character.[23]Neeson felt Schindler enjoyed outsmarting the Nazis, who regarded him as somewhat naïve. ""They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.""[24]To help him prepare for the role, Spielberg showed Neeson film clips ofTime WarnerCEOSteve Ross, who had a charisma that Spielberg compared to Schindler's.[25]He also located a tape of Schindler speaking, which Neeson studied to learn the correct intonations and pitch.[26]Fiennes was cast as Amon Göth after Spielberg viewed his performances inA Dangerous Man: Lawrence After ArabiaandEmily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. Spielberg said of Fiennes' audition that ""I saw sexual evil. It is all about subtlety: there were moments of kindness that would move across his eyes and then instantly run cold.""[27]Fiennes put on 28 pounds (13 kg) to play the role. He watched historicnewsreelsand talked toHolocaust survivorswho knew Göth. In portraying him, Fiennes said ""I got close to his pain. Inside him is a fractured, miserable human being. I feel split about him, sorry for him. He's like some dirty, battered doll I was given and that I came to feel peculiarly attached to.""[27]Doctors Samuel J. Leistedt and Paul Linkowski of theUniversité libre de Bruxellesdescribe Göth's character in the film as a classicpsychopath.[28]Fiennes looked so much like Göth in costume that when Mila Pfefferberg met him, she trembled with fear.[27]The character ofItzhak Stern(played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of the accountant Stern, factory managerAbraham Bankier, and Göth's personal secretary,Mietek Pemper.[29]The character serves as Schindler's alter ego and conscience.[30]Dustin Hoffmanwas offered the role but he refused it.[31][32]Overall, there are 126 parts with dialogue in the film. Thousands of extras were hired during filming.[15]Spielberg cast Israeli and Polish actors specially chosen for their Eastern European appearance.[33]Many of the German actors were reluctant to don the SS uniform, but some of them later thanked Spielberg for the cathartic experience of performing in the film.[22]Halfway through the shoot, Spielberg conceived the epilogue, where 128 survivors pay their respects at Schindler's grave in Jerusalem. The producers scrambled to find theSchindlerjudenand fly them in to film the scene.[15]Filming[edit]Principal photographybegan on March 1, 1993, inKraków, Poland, with a planned schedule of 75 days.[34]The crew shot at or near the actual locations, though the Płaszów camp had to be reconstructed in a nearby abandoned quarry, as modern high rise apartments were visible from the site of the original camp.[35][36]Interior shots of the enamelware factory in Kraków were filmed at a similar facility inOlkusz, while exterior shots and the scenes on the factory stairs were filmed at the actual factory.[37]The production received permission from Polish authorities to film on the grounds of theAuschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, but objections to filming within the actual death camp were raised by theWorld Jewish Congress.[38]To avoid filming inside the actual death camp, the film crew constructed a replica of a portion of the camp just outside the entrance of Birkenau.[39]There were someantisemiticincidents. A woman who encountered Fiennes in his Nazi uniform told him: ""The Germans were charming people. They didn't kill anybody who didn't deserve it.""[27]Antisemitic symbols were scrawled on billboards near shooting locations,[15]while Kingsley nearly entered a brawl with an elderly German-speaking businessman who insulted the Israeli actor Michael Schneider.[40]Nonetheless, Spielberg said that, atPassover, ""all the German actors showed up. They put onyarmulkesand opened upHaggadas, and the Israeli actors moved right next to them and began explaining it to them. And this family of actors sat around and race and culture were just left behind.""[40]I was hit in the face with my personal life. My upbringing. My Jewishness. The stories my grandparents told me about theShoah. And Jewish life came pouring back into my heart. I cried all the time.—Spielberg on his emotional state during the shoot[41]ShootingSchindler's Listwas deeply emotional for Spielberg, as the subject matter forced him to confront elements of his childhood, such as the antisemitism he faced. He was surprised that he did not cry while visiting Auschwitz; instead, he found himself filled with outrage. He was one of many crew members who could not force themselves to watch during the shooting of the scene where aging Jews are forced to run naked while being selected by Nazi doctors to go to Auschwitz.[42]Spielberg commented that he felt more like a reporter than a film maker – he would set up scenes and then watch events unfold, almost as though he were witnessing them rather than creating a film.[35]Several actresses broke down when filming the shower scene, including one who was born in a concentration camp.[22]Spielberg, his wifeKate Capshaw, and their five children rented a house in suburban Kraków for the duration of filming.[43]He later thanked his wife ""for rescuing me ninety-two days in a row ... when things just got too unbearable"".[44]Robin Williamscalled Spielberg to cheer him up, given the profound lack of humor on the set.[44]Spielberg spent several hours each evening editingJurassic Park, which was scheduled to premiere in June 1993.[45]Spielberg occasionally used German and Polish language dialogue to create a sense of realism. He initially considered making the film entirely in those languages, but decided ""there's too much safety in reading [subtitles]. It would have been an excuse [for the audience] to take their eyes off the screen and watch something else.""[22]Cinematography[edit]Influenced by the 1985 documentary filmShoah, Spielberg decided not to plan the film withstoryboards, and to shoot it like a documentary. Forty percent of the film was shot with handheld cameras, and the modest budget meant the film was shot quickly over seventy-two days.[46]Spielberg felt that this gave the film ""a spontaneity, an edge, and it also serves the subject.""[47]He filmed without usingSteadicams, elevated shots, orzoom lenses, ""everything that for me might be considered a safety net.""[47]This matured Spielberg, who felt that in the past he had always been paying tribute to directors such asCecil B. DeMilleorDavid Lean.[40]Spielberg decided to useblack and whiteto match the feel of documentary footage of the era. Cinematographer Janusz Kamiński compared the effect toGerman ExpressionismandItalian neorealism.[47]Kamiński said that he wanted to give the impression of timelessness to the film, so the audience would ""not have a sense of when it was made"".[35]Universal chairman Tom Pollock asked him to shoot the film on a colornegative, to allow color VHS copies of the film to later be sold, but Spielberg did not want to accidentally ""beautify events"".[47]However, scenes with the girl in the red coat were shot in color, and laterrotoscopedover by hand to remove all color except for the coat.[48]Music[edit]Main article:Schindler's List (soundtrack)John Williams, who frequently collaborates with Spielberg, composed the score forSchindler's List. The composer was amazed by the film, and felt it would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, ""You need a better composer than I am for this film."" Spielberg responded, ""I know. But they're all dead!""[49]Itzhak Perlmanperforms the theme on the violin.[14]In the scene where the ghetto is being liquidated by the Nazis, the folk songOyfn Pripetshik(Yiddish:אויפֿן פּריפּעטשיק, 'On the Cooking Stove') is sung by a children's choir. The song was often sung by Spielberg's grandmother, Becky, to her grandchildren.[50]Theclarinetsolos heard in the film were recorded byKlezmervirtuosoGiora Feidman.[51]Williams won anAcademy Award for Best Original ScoreforSchindler's List, his fifth win.[52]Selections from the score were released on asoundtrack album.[53]Themes and symbolism[edit]The film explores the theme ofgood and evil, using as its main protagonist a ""good German"", a popular characterization in American cinema.[54][18]While Göth is portrayed as an almost completely dark and evil person, Schindler gradually evolves from Nazi supporter to rescuer and hero.[55]Thus a second theme of redemption is introduced as Schindler, a disreputable schemer on the edges of respectability, becomes a father figure responsible for saving the lives of more than a thousand people.[56][57]The girl in red[edit]Schindler sees a girl in red during the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. The red coat is one of the few instances of color used in this predominantly black and white film.While the film is shot primarily in black and white, a red coat is used to distinguish a little girl in the scene depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. Later in the film, Schindler sees her exhumed dead body, recognizable only by the red coat she is still wearing. Spielberg said the scene was intended to symbolize how members of the highest levels of government in the United States knew the Holocaust was occurring, yet did nothing to stop it. He said: ""It was as obvious as a little girl wearing a red coat, walking down the street, and yet nothing was done to bomb the German rail lines. Nothing was being done to slow down ... the annihilation of European Jewry. So that was my message in letting that scene be in color.""[58]Andy Patrizio ofIGNnotes that the point at which Schindler sees the girl's dead body is the point at which he changes, no longer seeing ""the ash and soot of burning corpses piling up on his car as just an annoyance"".[59]ProfessorAndré H. Caronof theUniversité de Montréalwonders if the red symbolizes ""innocence, hope or the red blood of the Jewish people being sacrificed in the horror of the Holocaust"".[60]The girl was portrayed by Oliwia Dąbrowska, three years old at the time of filming. Spielberg asked Dąbrowska not to watch the film until she was eighteen, but she watched it when she was eleven, and says she was ""horrified"".[61]Upon seeing the film again as an adult, she was proud of the role she played.[61]Roma Ligocka, who says she was known in the Kraków Ghetto for her red coat, feels the character might have been based on her. Ligocka, unlike her fictional counterpart, survived the Holocaust. After the film was released, she wrote and published her own story,The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir(2002, in translation).[62]Alternatively, according to her relatives who were interviewed in 2014, the girl may have been inspired by Kraków resident Genya Gitel Chil.[63]Candles[edit]The opening scene features a family observingShabbat. Spielberg said that ""to start the film with the candles being lit ... would be a rich bookend, to start the film with a normal Shabbat service before the juggernaut against the Jews begins"".[15]When the color fades out in the film's opening moments, it gives way to a world in which smoke comes to symbolize bodies being burnt at Auschwitz. Only at the end, when Schindler allows his workers to hold Shabbat services, do the images of candle fire regain their warmth through color. For Spielberg, they represent ""just a glint of color, and a glimmer of hope.""[15]Sara Horowitz, director of the Koschitzky Centre for Jewish Studies atYork University, sees the candles as a symbol for the Jews of Europe, killed and then burned in thecrematoria. The two scenes bracket the Nazi era, marking its beginning and end.[64]She points out that normally, the woman of the house lights the Sabbath candles. In the film, it is men who perform this ritual, demonstrating not only the subservient role of women, but also the subservient position of Jewish men in relation toAryanmen, especially Göth and Schindler.[65]Other symbolism[edit]To Spielberg, the black and white presentation of the film came to represent the Holocaust itself: ""The Holocaust was life without light. For me the symbol of life is color. That's why a film about the Holocaust has to be in black-and-white.""[66]Robert Gellately notes the film in its entirety can be seen as a metaphor for the Holocaust, with early sporadic violence increasing into a crescendo of death and destruction. He also notes a parallel between the situation of the Jews in the film and the debate inNazi Germanybetween making use of the Jews forslave laboror exterminating them outright.[67]Water is seen as giving deliverance by Alan Mintz, Holocaust Studies professor at theJewish Theological Seminary of Americain New York. He notes its presence in the scene where Schindler arranges for aHolocaust trainloaded with victims awaiting transport to be hosed down, and the scene in Auschwitz, where the women are given an actual shower instead of receiving the expected gassing.[68]Release[edit]Schindler's Listopened in theaters on December 15, 1993, in the United States and December 25 in Canada. Its premiere in Germany was on March 1, 1994.[69]Its American network television premiere was onNBCon February 23, 1997. Shown uncut and without commercials, it ranked No. 3 for the week with a 20.9/31 rating/share,[70]the highestNielsen ratingfor any film since NBC's broadcast ofJurassic Parkin May 1995. The film aired on public television in Israel onHolocaust Memorial Dayin 1998.[71]The film was released in aTHXwidescreenVHSformat on September 9, 1997.[72]TheDVDwas released on March 9, 2004, in widescreen and full screen editions, on adouble-sided discwith the feature film beginning on side A and continuing on side B. Special features include a documentary introduced by Spielberg.[73]Also released for both formats was alimited editiongift set, which included the widescreen version of the film, Keneally's novel, the film's soundtrack onCD, a senitype, and a photo booklet titledSchindler's List: Images of the Steven Spielberg Film, all housed in a plexiglass case.[74]The laserdisc gift set was a limited edition that included the soundtrack, the original novel, and an exclusive photo booklet.[75]As part of its 20th anniversary, the film was released onBlu-ray Discon March 5, 2013.[76]The film was digitallyremasteredin4K,Dolby VisionandAtmosand wasreissuedinto theaters on December 7, 2018, for its 25th anniversary.[77]The film was released onUltra HD Blu-rayon December 18, 2018.[78]Following the success of the film, Spielberg founded theSurvivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, anonprofit organizationwith the goal of providing an archive for the filmed testimony of as many survivors of the Holocaust as possible, to save their stories. He continues to finance that work.[79]Spielberg used proceeds from the film to finance several relateddocumentaries, includingAnne Frank Remembered(1995),The Lost Children of Berlin(1996), andThe Last Days(1998).[80]Reception[edit]Critical response[edit]Steven Spielbergwon his firstAcademy AwardsforBest PictureandBest DirectorwithSchindler's List.Schindler's Listreceived acclaim from both film critics and audiences, with Americans such as talk show hostOprah Winfreyand PresidentBill Clintonurging others to see it.[81][82]World leaders in many countries saw the film, and some met personally with Spielberg.[81][83]OnRotten Tomatoes, the film has received an approval rating of 98% based on 137 reviews, with an average rating of 9.20/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Schindler's Listblends the abject horror of the Holocaust with Steven Spielberg's signature tender humanism to create the director's dramatic masterpiece.""[84]Metacriticgave the film aweighted averagescore of 95 out of 100, based on 30 critics.[85]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare average grade of ""A+"" on an A+ to F scale.[86]Stephen SchiffofThe New Yorkercalled it the best historical drama about the Holocaust, a film that ""will take its place in cultural history and remain there.""[87]Roger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film four stars out of four and described it as Spielberg's best, ""brilliantly acted, written, directed, and seen.""[88]Ebert andGene Siskelnamed it the best film of 1993.[89]Terrence Rafferty, also withThe New Yorker, admired the film's ""narrative boldness, visual audacity, and emotional directness."" He noted the performances of Neeson, Fiennes, Kingsley, and Davidtz as warranting special praise,[90]and calls the scene in the shower at Auschwitz ""the most terrifying sequence ever filmed.""[91]In the 2013 edition of hisMovie and Video Guide,Leonard Maltinawarded the picture a four-out-of-four-star rating; he described the film as a ""staggering adaptation of Thomas Keneally's best-seller ... with such frenzied pacing that it looks and feels like nothing Hollywood has ever made before ... Spielberg's most intense and personal film to date"".[92]James Verniere of theBoston Heraldnoted the film's restraint and lack of sensationalism, and called it a ""major addition to the body of work about the Holocaust.""[93]In his review forThe New York Review of Books, British criticJohn Grosssaid his misgivings that the story would be overly sentimentalized ""were altogether misplaced. Spielberg shows a firm moral and emotional grasp of his material. The film is an outstanding achievement.""[94]Mintz notes that even the film's harshest critics admire the ""visual brilliance"" of the fifteen-minute segment depicting the liquidation of the Kraków ghetto. He describes the sequence as ""realistic"" and ""stunning"".[95]He points out that the film has done much to increase Holocaust remembrance and awareness as the remaining survivors pass away, severing the last living links with the catastrophe.[96]The film's release in Germany led to widespread discussion about why most Germans did not do more to help.[97]Criticism of the film also appeared, mostly from academia rather than the popular press.[98]Sara Horowitz points out that much of the Jewish activity seen in the ghetto consists of financial transactions such as lending money, trading on the black market, or hiding wealth, thus perpetuating a stereotypical view of Jewish life.[99]Horowitz notes that while the depiction of women in the film accurately reflects Nazi ideology, the low status of women and the link between violence and sexuality is not explored further.[100]History professorOmer BartovofBrown Universitynotes that the physically large and strongly drawn characters of Schindler and Göth overshadow the Jewish victims, who are depicted as small, scurrying, and frightened – a mere backdrop to the struggle of good versus evil.[101]Horowitz points out that the film's dichotomy of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the film does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust.[102]AuthorJason Epsteincommented that the film gives the false impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust.[103]Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.[104]Bartov wrote that the ""positively repulsive kitsch of the last two scenes seriously undermines much of the film's previous merits"". He describes the humanization of Schindler as ""banal"", and is critical of what he describes as the ""Zionistclosure"" set to the song ""Jerusalem of Gold"".[105]Assessment by other filmmakers[edit]Schindler's Listwas very well received by many of Spielberg's peers. FilmmakerBilly Wilderwrote to Spielberg saying, ""They couldn't have gotten a better man. This movie is absolutely perfection.""[18]Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, ""I certainly wouldn't have done as good a job as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was.""[106]He citedSchindler's Listas an influence on his 1994 filmDeath and the Maiden.[107]Martin Scorsese, who passed the film back to Spielberg and stated his version had different ideas from the final film including a different ending, would later comment ""I admired the film greatly.""[17]The success ofSchindler's Listled filmmakerStanley Kubrickto abandon his own Holocaust project,Aryan Papers, which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic.[108]According to scriptwriterFrederic Raphael, when he suggested to Kubrick thatSchindler's Listwas a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, ""Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed.Schindler's Listis about 600 who don't.""[108][b]FilmmakerJean-Luc Godardaccused Spielberg of using the film to make a profit out of a tragedy while Schindler's wife,Emilie Schindler, lived in poverty inArgentina.[110]Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, ""not least because I had recently sent Emilie a check myself.""[111]He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there.[111]FilmmakerMichael Hanekecriticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: ""There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. You can only do something like that with a naive audience like in the United States. It's not an appropriate use of the form. Spielberg meant well – but it was dumb.""[112]Claude Lanzmann, the director of the nine-hour Holocaust documentaryShoah(1985), calledSchindler's Lista ""kitschy melodrama"" and a ""deformation"" of historical truth. ""Fiction is a transgression, I am deeply convinced that there is a ban on depiction [of the Holocaust]"", he said. Lanzmann also criticized Spielberg for viewing the Holocaust through the eyes of a German, saying ""it is the world in reverse"". He said: ""I sincerely thought that there was a time beforeShoah, and a time afterShoah, and that afterShoahcertain things could no longer be done. Spielberg did them anyway.""[113]Reaction of the Jewish community[edit]At a 1994Village Voicesymposium about the film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, a survivor of three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed.[114]Hungarian JewishauthorImre Kertész, a Holocaust survivor, feels it is impossible for life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed.[115]RabbiUri D. Herscherfound the film an ""appealing"" and ""uplifting"" demonstration of humanitarianism.[116]Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted with a feeling of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors.[117]Albert L. Lewis, Spielberg's childhood rabbi and teacher, described the film as ""Steven's gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being.""[116]Box office[edit]The film grossed $96.1 million ($209 million in 2024 dollars)[118]in the United States and Canada and over $321.2 million worldwide.[119]In Germany, the film was viewed by over 100,000 people in its first week alone from 48 screens[120][121]and was eventually shown in 500 theaters (including 80 paid for by municipal authorities),[122]with a total of six million admissions and a gross of $38 million.[123][124][125]Its 25th anniversary showings grossed $551,000 in 1,029 theaters.[126]Accolades[edit]Spielberg won theDirectors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Filmfor his work,[127]and shared theProducers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picturewith co-producers Branko Lustig and Gerald R.

The theme of the film is to reveal the brutality and cruelty of the Nazi soldiers to the Jews. It seems the illustration is propaganda with the purpose of asking for sympathy as well as to tarnish the other race.[143]ThePrime Minister of Malaysiaat the time,Mahathir Mohamad, said that Malaysians ""have the right to ban any movie"". He went on to say, ""I'm not antisemitic... I'm anti-Zionist expansion (and) the conquest of Arab territories by Zionists"".[143]The film was also banned inIndonesia, where the Committee for World Muslim Solidarity described it as ""nothing but Zionist propaganda.""[144]In thePhilippines, chief censor Henrietta Mendez ordered cuts of three scenes depictingsexual intercourseand female nudity before the film could be shown in cinemas. Spielberg refused, and pulled the film from screening in Philippine cinemas, which prompted theSenateto demand the abolition of the censorship board.PresidentFidel V. Ramoshimself intervened, ruling that the film could be shown uncut to anyone over the age of 15.[145]According toSlovakfilmmakerJuraj Herz, the scene in which a group of women confuse an actual shower with a gas chamber is taken directly, shot by shot, from his filmZastihla mě noc(The Night Overtakes Me, 1986). Herz wanted to sue, but was unable to fund the case.[146]The song ""Yerushalayim Shel Zahav""(""Jerusalem of Gold"") is featured in the film's soundtrack and plays near the end of the film. This caused some controversy in Israel, as the song (which was written in 1967 byNaomi Shemer) is widely considered an informal anthem of the Israeli victory in theSix-Day War. In Israeli prints of the film, the song was replaced with ""Halikha LeKesariya""(""A Walk to Caesarea"") byHannah Szenes, a World War II resistance fighter.[147]For the 1997 American television showing, the film was broadcast virtually unedited. The telecast was the first to receive a TV-M (nowTV-MA) rating under theTV Parental Guidelinesthat had been established earlier that year.[148]Tom Coburn, then anOklahomacongressman, said that in airing the film, NBC had brought television ""to an all-time low, with full-frontal nudity, violence and profanity"", adding that it was an insult to ""decent-minded individuals everywhere"".[149]Under fire from bothRepublicansandDemocrats, Coburn apologized, saying, ""My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say."" He clarified his opinion, stating that the film ought to have been aired later at night when there would not be ""large numbers of children watching without parental supervision"".[150]Controversy arose in Germany for the film's television premiere onProSieben. Protests among the Jewish community ensued when the station intended to televise it with two commercial breaks of 3–4 minutes each.Ignatz Bubis, head of theCentral Council of Jews in Germany, said: ""It is problematic to interrupt such a movie by commercials"".[123]Jerzy Kanal, chairman of the Jewish Community of Berlin, added ""It is obvious that the film could have a greater impact [on society] when broadcast unimpeded by commercials. The station has to do everything possible to broadcast the film without interruption.""[123]As a compromise, the broadcast included one break consisting of a short news update framed with commercials. ProSieben was also obliged to broadcast two accompanying documentaries to the film, showing ""The daily lives of the Jews in Hebron and New York"" prior to broadcast and ""The survivors of the Holocaust"" afterwards.[123]Legacy[edit]Schindler's Listfeatured on a number of ""best of"" lists, including theTIMEmagazine's Top Hundred as selected by criticsRichard CorlissandRichard Schickel,[4]Time Outmagazine's 100 Greatest Films Centenary Poll conducted in 1995,[151]and Leonard Maltin's ""100 Must See Movies of the Century"".[5]TheVaticanincludedSchindler's Listin itslist of 45 important films– the latest-released entry to make the list.[152]AChannel 4poll namedSchindler's Listthe ninth greatest film of all time,[6]and it ranked fourth in their 2005 war films poll.[153]The film was named the best of 1993 by critics such asJames Berardinelli,[154]Roger Ebert,[89]andGene Siskel.[155]Deeming the film ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"", theLibrary of Congressselected it for preservation in theNational Film Registryin 2004.[156]The film was shown at theBerlinale Film Festivalin February 2023, at which Spielberg received an honoraryGolden Bearaward.[157]Due to the increased interest in Kraków created by the film, the city boughtOskar Schindler's Enamel Factoryin 2007 to create a permanent exhibition about the German occupation of the city from 1939 to 1945. The museum opened in June 2010.[158]A portion of Schindler's Brünnlitz factory became the Museum of Survivors, opening in May 2025, 80 years after the end of World War II. Daniel Löw-Beer, whose family owned the factory starting in 1854, started the Arks Foundation in 2019 to raise funds for the museum. Other buildings may also be restored.[159]See also[edit]1993 in filmList of Holocaust filmsNotes[edit]^The film incorrectly spells Leipold's name as ""Josef Liepold""[8]^Schindler is actually credited with saving more than 1,200 Jews.[109]^Williams also won aGrammyfor the film's musical score.[160]References[edit]^British Film Board.^abcdeMcBride 1997, p. 416.^""Schindler's List (1993)"".Box Office Mojo.Archivedfrom the original on April 16, 2021.

The sequel toStar Wars(1977),[ii]it is the second film in theStar Warsfilm series and the fifth chronological chapter of the ""Skywalker Saga"". Set three years after the events ofStar Wars, the film recounts the battle between the malevolentGalactic Empire, led by theEmperor, and theRebel Alliance, led byLuke SkywalkerandPrincess Leia. As the Empire goes on the offensive, Luke trains to masterthe Forceso he can confront the Emperor's powerful disciple,Darth Vader. Theensemble castincludesMark Hamill,Harrison Ford,Carrie Fisher,Billy Dee Williams,Anthony Daniels,David Prowse,Kenny Baker,Peter Mayhew, andFrank Oz.Following the success ofStar Wars, Lucas hired Brackett to write the sequel. After she died in 1978, he outlined the wholeStar Warssaga and wrote the next draft himself, before hiringRaiders of the Lost Ark(1981) writer Kasdan to enhance his work. To avoid the stress he faced directingStar Wars, Lucas handed the responsibility to Kershner and focused on expanding his special effects companyIndustrial Light & Magicinstead. Filmed from March to September 1979 inFinse, Norway, and atElstree Studiosin England,The Empire Strikes Backfaced production difficulties, including actor injuries, illnesses, fires, and problems securing additional financing as costs rose. Initially budgeted at $8million, costs had risen to $30.5million by the project's conclusion.Released on May 21, 1980, the highly anticipated sequel became thehighest-grossing film that year, earning approximately $401.5million worldwide. Unlike its lighthearted predecessor,Empiremet with mixed reviews from critics, and fans were conflicted about its darker and more mature themes. The film was nominated for various awards and wontwo Academy Awards,two Grammy Awards, anda BAFTA, among others. Subsequent releases have raised the film's worldwide gross to $538–549million and, adjusted for inflation, it is the13th-highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada.Since its release,The Empire Strikes Backhas been critically reassessed and is now often regarded as the best film in theStar Warsseries and among thegreatest films ever made. It has had a significant influence on filmmaking and popular culture and is often considered an example of a sequel superior to its predecessor. The climax, in which Vader reveals he is Luke's father, is often ranked as one of the greatestplot twistsin cinema. The film spawned a variety of merchandise and adaptations, including video games and a radio play. The United StatesLibrary of Congressselected it for preservation in theNational Film Registryin 2010.Return of the Jedi(1983) followedEmpire, concluding theoriginalStar Warstrilogy.Prequelandsequel trilogieshave since been released.Plot[edit]Three years after the destruction of theDeath Star,[iii]theImperialfleet, led byDarth Vader, dispatchesprobe droidsacross the galaxy in search of theRebel Alliance. One probe locates the rebel base on the ice planetHoth. AwampacapturesLuke Skywalkerbefore he can investigate the probe crash site, but he escapes by usingthe Forceto retrieve hislightsaberand wound the beast. Before Luke succumbs tohypothermia, theForce spiritof his deceased mentor,Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planetDagobahto train as aJedi Knightunder theJedi MasterYoda.Han Solodiscovers Luke and insulates him against the weather inside his deceasedtauntaunmount until they are rescued the next morning.Alerted to the rebels' location, the Empire launches a large-scale attack usingAT-AT walkers, forcing the rebels to evacuate the base. Han,Princess Leia,C-3POandChewbaccaescape aboard theMillennium Falcon, but the ship'shyperdrivemalfunctions. They hide in anasteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer amid the tension. Vader summons several bounty hunters, includingBoba Fett, to find theFalcon. Evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on thegas planetBespin, which is governed by his old friendLando Calrissian. Fett tracks them there, and Vader forces Lando to surrender the group to the Empire, knowing Luke will come to their aid.Meanwhile, Luke travels withR2-D2in hisX-wing fighterto Dagobah, where he crash-lands. He meets Yoda, a diminutive creature who reluctantly accepts him as his Jedi apprentice after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit. Yoda trains Luke to master the light side of the Force and resist negative emotions that will seduce him to thedark side, as they did Vader. Luke struggles to control his anger and impulsiveness and fails to comprehend the nature and power of the Force until he witnesses Yoda use it to levitate the X-wing from the swamp. Luke has a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, despite Obi-Wan's and Yoda's protestations, abandons his training to rescue them. Although Obi-Wan believes Luke is their only hope, Yoda asserts that ""there is another.""Leia confesses her love for Han before Vader freezes him incarboniteto test whether the process will safely imprison Luke. Han survives and is given to Fett, who intends to collect his bounty fromJabba the Hutt. Lando frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett's escape. The group fights its way back to theFalconand flees the city. Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel over the city's central air shaft. Vader defeats Luke, severing his right hand and separating him from his lightsaber. He urges Luke to embrace the dark side and help him destroy his master, theEmperor, so they may rule the galaxy together. Luke refuses, citing Obi-Wan's claim that Vader killed his father, prompting Vader to reveal that he is Luke's father.

Negotiations began in mid-1977 between the studio and Lucas's representatives. Fox had already given Lucas controlling interest in the series' merchandising and sequels because it had thoughtStar Warswould be worthless.[40]Terms were agreed quickly for the sequel compared to the original, in part because Fox executiveAlan Ladd Jr.had been supportive of the original and was eager for the sequel.[44]The 100-page contract was signed on September 21, 1977, dictating that Fox would distribute the film but have no creative input, in exchange for 50% of the gross profits on the first $20million earned, with the percentage increasing to 77.5% in the producers' favor if it exceeded $100million. Filming had to begin by January 1979 for release on May 1, 1980.[41][45]The deal offered the possibility of significant financial gain for Lucas, but he risked financial ruin if the sequel failed.[17][46]To mitigate some of the risk, Lucas founded The Chapter II Company to control the film's development and absorb its liabilities.[47]He signed a contract between the company and Lucasfilm, granting himself 5% of thebox office gross profits.[48]He also founded Black Falcon to licenseStar Warsmerchandising rights, using the income to subsidize his ongoing projects.[49]Development for the sequel began in August 1977, under the titleStar Wars Chapter II.[50]Lucas considered replacing producerGary KurtzwithHoward Kazanjianbecause Kurtz had not fulfilled his role and left problems unresolved while filmingStar Wars. Kurtz convinced him otherwise by trading on his longtime loyalty to Lucas and knowledge of theStar Warsproperty.[51]Lucas took an executive producer role, enabling him to focus on his businesses and the development ofRaiders of the Lost Ark(1981).[17][41][52]By late 1977, Kurtz began hiring key crew members, including production designerNorman Reynolds, consultantJohn Barry, makeup artistStuart Freeborn, and first assistant directorDavid Tomblin.[17][53]Lucas rehired artistsRalph McQuarrieandJoe Johnstonto maintain visual consistency withStar Wars, and the three began conceptualizing the Hoth battle in December.[54]By this point, the budget had increased to $10million.[55]Lucas wanted a director who would support the material and accept that he was ultimately in charge.[17]He considered around 100 directors, includingAlan ParkerandJohn Badham, before hiring his old acquaintanceIrvin Kershnerin February 1978.[17][56]Kershner was reluctant to direct the sequel to a film as successful asStar Wars, and his friends warned him against taking the job, believing he would be blamed if it failed.[17][57]Lucas convinced Kershner it was not so much a sequel as a chapter in a larger story; he also promised him he could make the film his own way.[57]Writing[edit]Left to right:Leigh Brackett(in 1941) andLawrence Kasdan(2015). Brackett wrote the first draft of theEmpirescreenplay before her death in 1978. Lucas then wrote his own script, which he hired Kasdan to complete.Lucas began formulating ideas in August 1977. These included the Emperor, Luke's lost sister, and an explanation of facial injuries Hamill had suffered from an accident after filmingStar Wars(Lucas told Hamill that, had he died, his character would have been replaced, not recast).[58]Hamill recounted being told the sister character might be Leia, which he found disappointing.[59]Lucas had writtenStar Warsbut did not enjoy developing lore for an original universe.[60]Science-fiction writerLeigh Brackett, whom Lucas met through a friend, excelled in quick-paced dialogue. He hired her for $50,000, aware that she had cancer.[e]Between November28 and December2, 1977, Lucas and Brackett held a story conference.[35][62]Lucas had core ideas in mind but wanted Brackett to piece them together.[17][60]He envisioned one central plot complemented by three main subplots, set across 60 scenes, 100 script pages, and a two-hour runtime.[63]They formed a general outline and ideas that included the Wookiee homeworld, new alien species, the Galactic Emperor, a gambler from Han's past, water and city planets, Luke's lost twin sister, and a diminutive, froglike creature, Minch Yoda.[35][64][65]Lucas drew on influences includingThe Thing from Another World(1951), the novelDune(1965), and the television seriesFlash Gordon(1954).[66]Around this time, Kurtz conceived the titleThe Empire Strikes Back.[f]He said they avoided calling itStar Wars IIbecause films with ""II"" in their titles were seen as inferior.[41]Brackett completed her first draft in February 1978, titledStar Wars sequel, from the adventures of Luke Skywalker.[57][61][68]The draft contained a city in the clouds, a chase through an asteroid belt, a greater focus on the love triangle between Luke, Han, and Leia (who is portrayed as adamsel in distress), the battle of Hoth and a climactic duel between Luke and Darth Vader. The ghosts of his father and Obi-Wan visit Luke, leaving Vader a separate character. The draft reveals Luke has a sister (not Leia), Han goes on a mission to recruit his powerful stepfather, and Lando is a clone from theClone Wars.[35]Lucas made detailed notes and attempted to contact Brackett, but she had been hospitalized, and died of cancer a few weeks later, on March 18.[17][69]Rewrite[edit]The strict schedule left Lucas no choice but to write the second draft himself.[17][61][70]Though Brackett's draft followed Lucas's outline, he found she had portrayed the characters differently than he intended.[71]Lucas completed his handwritten, 121-page draft on April 1. He found the process more enjoyable than onStar Warsbecause he was familiar with the universe, but struggled to write a satisfying conclusion, leaving it open for a third film.[72]This draft established Luke's sister as a new character undertaking a similar journey,[73]Vader's castle and his fear of the emperor,[74]distinct power levels in controlling the Force,[75]Yoda's unconventional speech pattern,[76]and bounty hunters, including Boba Fett. Lucas wrote Fett like theMan with No Name, combining him with an abandoned idea for a SuperStormtrooper.[77]Lucas's handwritten draft included mention of Vader being Luke's father, but the typed script omitted this revelation. Despite contradictory information in drafts that included the ghost of Luke's father, Lucas said he had always intended for Vader to be Luke's father and omitted it from scripts to avoid leaks.[17][78]Lucas included elements such as Han's debt to Jabba, and recontextualized Luke leaving Dagobah to rescue his friends: in Brackett's draft, Obi-Wan instructs Luke to leave; Lucas had Luke choose to do so. He also removed a scene of Luke massacring stormtroopers to convey him falling to the dark side, wanting to instead explore this in the next film.[70]Lucas believed it was important the characters be inspirational and appropriate for children.[79]His typed draft is titledStar Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back.[76]In June 1978, impressed with his work onRaiders of the Lost Ark, Lucas hiredLawrence Kasdanto refine the draft; Kasdan was paid $60,000.[17][61][80]In early July, Kasdan, Kershner and Lucas held a story conference to discuss Lucas's draft.[48][61]The group collaborated on ideas, with Lucas embracing their challenges and input.[17][81]Mandated to deliver a fifth of the script every other week, Kasdan began his rewrite, focusing on developing character relationships and psychologies; he completed the third draft by early August.[82]This version refined Minch Yoda—alternately named ""the Critter"", Minch, Buffy, and simply Yoda—from a slimy creature to a small blue one; each version retained the character's long life and wisdom.[17][35]Yoda was intended to teach Luke to respect everyone and not judge by appearances, and defy audience expectations.[17]The draft tightened or expanded dialogue to better pace action scenes, added more romance, and added or changed locations, such as moving a Vader scene from a spaceship deck to his private cubicle.[83]Lucas removed a line mentioning Lando deliberately abandoning his people, and had Luke contact Leia through the Force instead of Obi-Wan's ghost.[84]The fourth draft—mostly the same but with more detailed action—was submitted on October 24.[85]Although some of Brackett's ideas remained, such as Luke's Dagobah training, her dialogue and characterization were removed.[35][86]Kasdan described her take as from ""a different era"", lacking the necessary tone.[71]Kazanjian did not believe theWriters Guild of America Westwould approve of her receiving credit, but Lucas liked Brackett and supported her credit as co-writer. He also provided for her family beyond her contracted pay.[86][35]The fifth draft was completed in February 1979. It revised some scenes and introduced a ""Hogmen"" species devised by Kershner; Lucas did not like the idea because he perceived them as slaves.[87]Casting[edit]Billy Dee Williams(pictured in 1997) joined the cast asLando Calrissian.Mark Hamill (Luke), Carrie Fisher (Leia), Harrison Ford (Han), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), and Kenny Baker (R2-D2) all reprised theirStar Warsroles.[41][88]Hamill and Fisher were contracted for a second, third, and fourth film, but Ford had declined similar terms because of earlier bad experiences; he agreed to return because he wanted to improve on hisStar Warsperformance.[89]Hamill spent four months bodybuilding and learning karate, fencing, and kendo to prepare for his stunts.[87]David Prowse hesitated to return as Darth Vader because, as he was hidden behind a costume, he believed the role offered little job security; he returned after being told further delays would lead to his being replaced.[90]James Earl Jones returned to voice Vader but, as withStar Wars, declined a credit because he considered himself ""special effects"" to Prowse's physical performance. He earned $15,000 for half a day's work, plus a small percentage of the profits.[91][92]Anthony Daniels was reluctant to return asC-3PObecause he had received little acknowledgment for his previous performance, as the filmmakers played down his involvement to portray the droid as a real being. He ultimately agreed, however, for an improved salary.[93]Alec Guinness said he could not return as Obi-Wan because his failing eyesight required him to avoid bright lights.[56]Recasting him was considered but, determined to recruit him, Lucas agreed to a deal in late August 1979 which gave him a more limited role. Guinness was paid 0.25% ofEmpire's box office gross for his few hours of work.[94]Billy Dee Williams was cast as Lando Calrissian, making him the first black actor with a starring role in the series.[88][95]He found the character interesting because of his cape andArmenian surname; Williams believed this gave him room to develop the character. Williams said Lando was much like himself—a ""pretty cool guy"".[10]He believed it was atoken role, but was assured it was not specifically written for a black actor.[96]Kershner said Williams had the fantastic charm of a ""Mississippi riverboat hustler"".[96]Howard Rollins,Terry Alexander,Robert Christian, Thurman Scott, andYaphet Kottowere also considered for the part.[85][97]Yoda was voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz, with assistance fromKathryn Mullen,David Barclay, andWendy Froud.[98]Lucas had intended for a different actor to provide Yoda's voice, but decided it would be too difficult to cast someone who could match their voice to Oz's puppetry.[27]Jeremy Bulloch did not audition for Boba Fett; he was hired because the costume fit him. It was uncomfortable and top-heavy, making it difficult to maintain his balance, and the mask often steamed up. Bulloch assumed his lines would be dubbed over, as he had little dialogue (Fett's voice actor, Jason Wingreen, remained uncredited until 2000).[99]Bulloch also appears as an Imperial officer who restrains Leia on Bespin. No other cast member was available for this role, so Kurtz had him quickly change out of the Fett costume to stand in. John Morton portrays Fett in the same scene.[g]There was no extensive casting for the Emperor. Lucas chose Clive Revill to provide the character's voice, and actressMarjorie Eatonphysically portrayed the Emperor in test footage. The footage proved unsatisfactory, and special effects artistRick Bakercreated a full mask that his wife Elaine wore. Chimpanzee eyes were superimposed over her face; cat eyes and assistant accountant Laura Crockett's eyes were also considered.[26][27][59]Pre-production[edit]Pre-production began in early 1978. Although Kershner wanted two years, this phase only lasted a year.[100]Seeking an area to represent the ice planet Hoth, location scouts considered Finland, Sweden, and the Arctic Circle. The location needed to be free of trees and near populated areas for amenities.[101]Kershner credited a Fox distribution employee with recommendingFinse, Norway; Kurtz said it was Reynolds who had done so.[101]For the bog planet Dagobah, scouts looked at Central Africa, Kenya, and Scandinavia, but Lucas wanted to avoid shooting on location. He funded the construction of a ""Star Warsstage"" atElstree Studios, London, for the Dagobah and rebel base sets. Construction for the stage—which measured 1,250,000 cubic feet (35,000 m3) and cost $2million—began at the end of August.[41][102]Sets were the single biggest expense of the production, costing a total of $3.5million. By December, the budget had increased to $21.5million, more than double the original estimate.[103]Financial projections for The Chapter II Company suggested it would run a monthly deficit of $5–25million by the end of 1979, including over $2million in production costs and $400,000 to fund ILM.[85]As the start of filming in January 1979 loomed, a fire on Elstree's Stage 3—whereThe Shining(1980) was being filmed—destroyed the space planned forEmpire's sets.[65][104]The impact was significant, resulting in theEmpireproduction being forced to give up two stages soThe Shiningcould continue filming. Sixty-four sets had to be moved through nine stages and the filming schedule had to be altered. Poor weather delayed construction of necessary sets, props, and theStar Warsstage.[104]By February 25, the Finse location crew had arrived in Norway to receive flown-in equipment containers and begin digging trenches for battle scenes.[105]Music[edit]Main article:The Empire Strikes BacksoundtrackThe musical score forThe Empire Strikes Backwas composed and conducted byJohn Williamsand performed by theLondon Symphony Orchestra, at a cost of about $250,000.[106]Williams began planning the score in November 1979, estimating the film would require 107 minutes of music.[107]For two weeks across 18 three-hour sessions just after Christmas, Williams recorded the score at Anvil Studios andAbbey Road Studios, London.[108]Up to 104 musicians were involved at a time, playing such instruments as oboes, piccolos, pianos, and harps.[109]Filming[edit]Commencement in Norway[edit]Hardangerjøkulenglacierpictured in 2007. It served as the exterior of the ice planet Hoth.Principal photography began on March 5, 1979, on theHardangerjøkulenglaciernear Finse, Norway, representing the planet Hoth.[h]Initially scheduled to conclude on June 22, by the end of the first week it was obvious it would take longer and cost more.[41][112]Filming the Hoth scenes on a set was considered, but ultimately rejected as inauthentic. The location filming coincided with the area's worst snowstorm in half a century, impeding the production with blizzards, 40-mile-per-hour (64 km/h) winds, and temperatures between −26 °F (−32 °C) and −38 °F (−39 °C).[i]The weather cleared only twice; some days, filming could not take place.[115]The frigid conditions made theacetate filmbrittle, camera lenses iced over, snow seeped into equipment, and effects paint froze inside the tin.[17][116]To counter these effects, lenses were kept cool but the camera body was warmed to protect the film, battery, and camera operators' hands.[117]The crew was outside for up to 11 hours at a time, being subjected to thin air, limited visibility, and mildfrostbite; one crewman slipped and broke two ribs.[118]The difficult conditions led to strong camaraderie among crewmembers.[119]Avalanches blocked direct transport links, and trenches dug by the crew quickly filled with snow. Scenes could be prepared only a few hours in advance and many scenes were filmed just outside the crew's hotel as the shifting weather regularly altered the scenery.[17][120]Although Fisher was not scheduled to film scenes in Norway, she joined Hamill on location because she wanted to observe the process.[87]Ford was not scheduled for the Finse phase, but to compensate for the delays, he was brought there instead of creating a separate set in a Leeds studio. On a few hours' notice, he arrived in Finse, having traveled the last 23 miles (37 km) of the snow-laden journey by snowplow.[121]Production returned to England after a week, though Hamill had an additional day of filming. Thesecond unitremained in Norway through March to film explosions, incidental footage, and battle scenes featuring 35 mountain rescue skiers as extras. The skiers' work was compensated with a donation to theNorwegian Red Cross.[122]To film the Imperial probe landing, eight sticks of dynamite were placed on the glacier and set to explode at sunrise, but the demolitions expert in charge knocked the battery out of his radio and received the message too late to capture the intended shot.[123]The opening sweeping shot of the area was captured by flying a helicopter to 15,000 feet (4,600 m) and performing a controlled drop at a rate of 30 miles per hour (48 km/h) or 2,500 feet (760 m) a minute.[124]A heated shelter for the helicopter had to be constructed, which delayed filming of the shot by four weeks.[125]The second unit, scheduled to be in Finse for three weeks, was there for eight.[124]When the crew returned to London, they had only half the planned footage, and background images for special effects shots were uneven.[17][114][126]Empire's budget increased to around $22million because of the delays and having to rework scenes to compensate for the missing footage.[127]Filming at Elstree Studios[edit]On-set filming locationElstree Studios(pictured 2009) in Hertfordshire, EnglandFilming at Elstree began on March 13, 1979.[127]Production remained behind schedule without Stage 3 (which had been destroyed by fire), and the incompleteStar Warsstage lacked protection from the cold weather. The result was that the crew had to work out of any available space.[128]To save time, some scenes were shot simultaneously, such as those set in the ice cavern and medical bay.[129]Kershner wanted each character to make a unique entrance in the film. While filming Vader's entrance, the snow troopers preceding Prowse tripped over the polystyrene ice, and the stuntman behind him stood on his cape, breaking it off, causing Prowse to fall onto the snow troopers.[130]The shoot was strenuous and mired in conflicts.[17][131]Fisher suffered from influenza and bronchitis, her weight dropped to 85 pounds (39 kg) while working 12-hour days, and she collapsed on set from an allergic reaction to steam or spray paint. She was also allergic to most makeup.[132]Her overuse ofhallucinogensand painkillers worsened her condition, as did the anxiety she experienced while performing her speech to the rebels.[133]Stress and personal traumas led to frequent arguments among Hamill, Fisher, and Ford.[17][134]Ford and Hamill fell ill or were injured at different times.[135]Hamill was depressed by his isolation from human cast members, as his scenes required him to interact mostly with puppets, robots, and actors whose voices would be added later or dubbed over.[136][137]He was meant to use an earpiece to hear Oz's Yoda dialogue, but for various reasons this did not work, and he struggled to form a relationship with the character. The Dagobah set was liberally sprayed with mineral oil, which caused him physical discomfort for long periods. Hamill called it a ""physical ordeal the whole time... but I don't really mind that"".[136]At one point, Oz cheered Hamill up with aMiss Piggyroutine. Hamill recalled Ford giving him a kiss instead of reading his lines, which entertained the crew.[59]Mayhew fell ill while filming Han's torture scene because the set used bursts of steam, which raised the ambient temperature to 90 °F (32 °C) while he was wearing a wool suit.[138]Bank of America representatives visited the set in late March, concerned about rising costs.[139]Lucas rarely visited the set, but arrived on May 6 after realizing the production was behind schedule and over budget.[41]An official Lucasfilm memo instructed staff to misstate the film's direct costs as $17million.[140]At this point, Kurtz and Lucas estimated it would cost $25–28million to complete filming.[127][140]Finances ran out in mid-July when Bank of America refused to increase the loan.[17][141]The crisis was kept from the crew, including Kershner, and tactics were used to delay its impact, including paying staff biweekly instead of weekly and Lucas borrowing money from his merchandising company Black Falcon.[141]Lucas worried he would have to sellEmpireand its associated rights to Fox to sustain the project, losing his creative freedom. Fox was also threatening to buy out thebondand take over filming.[127][141]With about 20% ofEmpireleft to film, Lucasfilm president Charles Weber arranged forBank of Bostonto refinance the loan to $31million, including $27.7million from Bank of Boston and $3million guaranteed by Fox in exchange for an increased percentage of the theatrical returns and 10% of merchandising profits. Lucasfilm took out the loan, making the company directly liable.[17][127][142]TheStar Warsstage was completed in early May. It was too small to house the Rebel hangar and Dagobah sets, and an extension had to be funded and built. The producers mandated filming begin on the stage on May 18, regardless of its state.[143]The hangar scene involved 77 rebel extras, which cost £2,000 per day.[144]Around 50 short tons (45 long tons) ofdendritic salt, mixed withmagnesium sulfatefor a sparkle effect, were used for the snowy sets; this combination of substances gave the cast and crew headaches.[145]Second unit director John Barry died suddenly in early June;Harley Cokelissreplaced him a week later.[65][146][147]The typical purpose of the second unit was to do time-consuming filming for special effects shots, but they were now filming main scenes—including Luke's ice cave imprisonment—because the schedule had overrun by around 26 days.[148]Hamill was unavailable for several days after injuring his hand during a stunt jump from aspeeder bike. Having been called in for the stunt the same day his son was born, aggravated by the salt-laden setting, and exhausted, he angrily chastised Kurtz for not using a double for the scene.[149]Kershner's hands-on directing style, which included him acting out how he wanted a scene performed, agitated Hamill; Kershner, for his part, was frustrated that Hamill was not following his advice.[150]The life-size hangar set was dismantled in mid-June to allow the construction of other sets around the full-scaleMillenium Falcon. These scenes had to be filmed efficiently, so theFalconcould be dismantled to make way for the Dagobah set.[151]Filming began on the carbon chamber scene in late June while the second unit filmed anything they could.[152]The raised set was largely incomplete, and low lighting and steam were used to conceal any obvious flaws. The fog machines and heat from the steam made many cast and crew members sick; it took approximately three weeks to film.[153]The confession of love between Leia and Han was scripted with both of them admitting their feelings for the other. Kershner felt this was too ""sappy"". He had Ford improvise lines repeatedly until Ford said he would do only one more take; his response to Leia's confession of love in the final take was ""I know"".[17]By the end of the month, cast and crew morale was low.[154]The duel, Dagobah, and conclusion[edit](Left to right)David Prowse(pictured in 2007) andJames Earl Jones(2013). To avoid Darth Vader's confession being leaked publicly, Vader actor Prowse was given different lines to speak, which were dubbed over by Jones.Hamill returned in early July to film his climactic battle against Darth Vader, portrayed bystunt doubleBob Anderson, who said the experience was like fighting blindfolded because of the costume. Hamill spent weeks practicing his fencing routine, eventually growing frustrated and refusing to continue.[155]The next scene, where Vader confesses he is Luke's father, was shrouded in secrecy. Prowse was given the line ""Obi-Wan Kenobi is your father"" to read because he was known for repeatedly leaking information.[17]Only Kershner, the producers, and Hamill knew the actual line.[17][156]While filming the scene, Hamill was positioned on a platform suspended 35 feet (11 m) above a pile of mattresses.[17]Footage of his fall into the reactor shaft was damaged during processing and the scene had to be reshot in early August.[157]The Vader confrontation took eight weeks to film. Hamill insisted on doing as many of his stunts as possible, though the insurers refused to allow him to perform a 15-foot (4.6 m) fall out of a window. He accidentally fell from a nine-inch ledge 40 feet (12 m) high but rolled on landing to avoid injury.[136]Lucas returned to the set on July 15 and stayed for the rest of filming.[141]He rewrote Luke's scenes on Dagobah, removing or trimming them so they could be shot in just over two weeks.[158]Most of the cast completed filming by the start of August, including Ford, Fisher, Williams, Mayhew, and Daniels.[159]Hamill began filming on the Dagobah set with Yoda. They only had 12 days to film because Oz was scheduled for another project.[160]With the film now over 50 days behind schedule, Kurtz was removed from his role and replaced by Kazanjian and associate producerRobert Watts.[161]One of the last scenes shot was of Luke exploring the dark side tree on Dagobah. A wrap party was held on the set to mark the official conclusion of filming on September 5, 1979, after 133 days. Guinness filmed his scenes against a bluescreen the same day.[162][163]Kershner and the second unit continued filming additional footage, including Luke's X-Wing being raised from the swamp.[162]Kershner left the set on September 9, and Hamill finished 103 days of filming two days later.[127][164]The second unit finished filming on September 24 with Hamill's stunt double.[165][166]There was approximately 400,000 feet (120,000 m) of film, or 80 hours of footage.[167]The final budget was $30.5million.[vi][169]Kurtz blamedinflation, which had increased resource, cast, and crew costs significantly.[170]Lucas blamed Kurtz for lack of oversight and poor financial planning.[17][171]Watts said Kurtz was not good with people and never developed a working relationship with Kershner, making it difficult for him to temper the director's indulgences.[172]Kurtz had also given Kershner more leeway because of the delays caused by the Stage 3 fire.[140]Kershner's slower work pace had frustrated Lucas.[17][173]He described his filming style as frugal, performing two or three takes with littlecoverage filmthat could later compensate for mistakes. Watts and Reynolds said Kershner often looked at new ways of doing things, but this required planning that only delayed things further.[135]Kershner had tried replicating the quick pacing ofStar Wars, not lingering on any scene for too long, and encouraged improvisation, modifying scenes and dialogue to focus more on characters' emotions, such asC-3POinterrupting Han and Leia as they are about to kiss.[17][174][175]Kazanjian said many mistakes were made but blamed Weber, Lucasfilm vice president John Moohr, and primarily Kurtz.[176]Actor John Morton called Kurtz an unsung hero, who brought his experience of filming war toEmpire.[177]Post-production[edit]The schedule overrun resulted in filming and post-production taking place simultaneously; filmed footage was shipped immediately to ILM to begin effects work.[178]Arough cutresembling the finished film (minus special effects) was put together by mid-October 1979.[179]Lucas provided 31 pages of notes about changes he wanted, mainly alterations in dialogue and scene lengths.[180]Jones recorded Vader's dialogue in late 1979 and early 1980.[181]In early 1980, Lucas changed the long-planned opening of Luke riding his tauntaun to a shot of the Star Destroyer launching probes. He continued tweaking elements to improve the special effects, but even with ILM staff working up to 24 hours a day, six days a week, there was not enough time to do everything they wanted.[182]A Dagobahpick-upscene, in which R2-D2 is spat out by a monster, was filmed in Lucas's swimming pool;[183]the Emperor's scenes were filmed in February 1980.[27]Fox executives did not see a cut of the film until March.[184]That month, Lucas decided he wanted an additional Hoth scene and auditioned 50 ILM crew to appear as Rebels.[27]The final 124-minute cut was completed on April 16, which triggered a $10million payment from Fox to Bank of Boston.[184][185][186]Lucasfilm also launched an employee bonus scheme to shareEmpire's profits with its staff.[187]Test screenings were held in San Francisco on April 19. While the tauntaun special effect was criticized, audiences liked Han's reply of ""I know"" to Leia's confession of love. Lucas was unimpressed by the scene, believing it was not how Han would act.[17][188]Because the magnetic soundtrack could flake from the film reels, Kurtz hired people to watch the film reels 24 hours a day to identify defects; 22% were defective.[169]Shortly after the film's theatrical release, Lucas decided the ending was unclear about where Luke and Leia were in relation to Lando and Chewbacca. In the three-week window between its limited and wider release, Lucas, Johnston, and visual effects artistKen Ralstonfilmed enhancement scenes at ILM, using existing footage, a new score, modified dialogue, and new miniatures to create establishing shots of the Rebel fleet and their relative positions.[189]By the project's conclusion, around 700 people had worked onEmpire.[190]Special effects and design[edit]Main article:Special effects of The Empire Strikes BackLucas's firm, Industrial Light & Magic, developed the special effects forThe Empire Strikes Backat a cost of $8million, including staffing and the construction of the company's new facility in Marin County, California.[169]The building was still under construction when staff arrived in September 1978, and initially lacked the equipment that would be necessary to complete their work.[111][114][191]Compared to the 360 special effects shots forStar Wars,Empirerequired around 600.[192]The crew, supervised byRichard EdlundandBrian Johnson, includedDennis Muren,Bruce Nicholson,Lorne Peterson,Steve Gawley,Phil Tippett,[111]Tom St. Amand,[193]and Nilo Rodis-Jamero.[191]Up to 100 people worked on the project daily, including Stuart Freeborn, who was responsible mainly for crafting the Yoda puppet.[57][194]Various techniques, includingminiatures,matte paintings,stop motion, articulated models and full-size vehicles were used to createEmpire's many effects.[65][134][195]Release[edit]Context[edit]See also:1980 in filmMark Hamillpromoting the film in 1980Industry professionals expected comedies and positive entertainment to dominate theaters in 1980 because of low morale in the United States caused by aneconomic recession. This generally increased theatrical visits as audiences sought escapism and ignored romantic films and depictions ofblue-collar life.[196][197]A surge of interest in science fiction followingStar Warsled to many low-budget entries in the genre attempting to profit by association and big-budget entries such asStar Trek: The Motion PictureandThe Black Hole, both released just months beforeThe Empire Strikes Back.[41]Sequels were not expected to perform as well as their originals, and there were low expectations for merchandising.[198]Even so, tie-in deals were arranged withCoca-Cola,Nestlé,General Mills, andToppscollectibles.[199]Fox was confident in the film and spent little money on advertising, taking out small advertisements in newspapers instead of full-page spreads.[185]The studio's market research showed 60% of those interested in the film were male.[200]Lucasfilm set up a telephone number allowing callers to hear a message from cast members.[201]Fox demanded a minimum 28-week appearance in theaters, although 12 weeks was the norm for major films.[187]Estimates suggestedEmpireneeded to earn $57.2million to be profitable, after marketing, distribution, and loan interest costs.[202]Credits and title[edit]As withStar Wars, Lucas wanted to place all of thecrew creditsat the end of the film to avoid interfering with the opening. TheWriters Guild of America(WGA) andDirectors Guild of America(DGA) had allowed this for the first film because Lucas directed and it opened with the logo for his namesake Lucasfilm, but forEmpirethey refused to allow Kershner or the first and second unit directors to be credited only at the end, fined Lucas $250,000 when he ignored them and tried to have the film removed from theaters.[174]Because Lucas had followed the laws relevant to the United Kingdom where it was produced, the DGA was unable to sanction him and instead fined Kershner $25,000.[200]Lucas paid his fine but was so frustrated that he left the WGA, DGA, andMotion Picture Association, which restricted his ability to write and direct future films.[174][203]The Hollywood Reporterleaked the film's title in January 1978;[204]it was officially announced in August.[205]Theopening crawlidentified the film asStar Wars: Episode V — The Empire Strikes Back, establishing Lucas's plan to make a nine-partStar Warsseries.Star Warswas also renamedEpisode IV — A New Hope.[206][207]Roger Kasteldesigned the theatrical poster.[208]Box office[edit]The first North American screening ofThe Empire Strikes Backtook place at theJohn F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts(pictured in 2010).A sneak preview ofThe Empire Strikes Backtook place on May 6, 1980 at theDominion Theatrein London, followed by another preview screening on May 17 at theKennedy Centerin Washington, D.C.[209]This event, which featured the principal cast, was attended by 600 children, includingSpecial Olympians.[210][209]The film's world premiere took place on May 20 at theOdeon Leicester Squarein London. Dubbed ""Empire Day"", the event included actors in Stormtrooper attire interacting with people across the city.[211][212][209]In North America,Empireopened mid-week on May 21, leading into the extendedMemorial Dayholiday weekend.[213]The number of theaters was deliberatelylimitedto 126 to make it difficult to get a ticket, thus generating more appeal—a strategy used with films expected to receive positive word of mouth.[185]The film earned $1.3million during its opening day—an average of $10,581 per theater.[214]It garnered a further $4.9million during the weekend and $1.5million during the Monday holiday, for a total of $6.4million—an average of $50,919 per theater. This madeEmpirethe number one film of the weekend, ahead of thecounterprogrammeddebuts of the comedyThe Gong Show Movie($1.5million) andThe Shining($600,000).[213][215][216]By the end of its first week, the film had earned $9.6million—a 60% increase overStar Wars—averaging $76,201 per theater, the highest-ever figure for a film in over 100 theaters.[185][217][218]It remained number one until its fourth weekend, when it fell to third with $3.6million, behind the spoof comedyWholly Moses!($3.62million) and the WesternBronco Billy($3.7million).[214][219]It regained the number one position in its fifth weekend, expanding its theater count to 823 and earning $10.8million.[214][220]Combined with its weekday gross,Empiregarnered a single-week gross of approximately $20million, a box office record the film would hold untilSuperman II's $24million the following year.[221][222][223]It remained number one for the next seven weeks, before falling to number two in its thirteenth week with $4.3million, behind the debutingSmokey and the Bandit II($10.9million). Detailed box office tracking is unavailable for the rest ofEmpire's 32-week, 1,278-theater total run.[214][224]Empireearned between $181.4–209.4million in its initial North American release, making it thehighest-grossing film of the year, ahead of the comedy films9 to 5($103.3million),Stir Crazy($101.3million), andAirplane!($83.5million).[196][225][226]Although it earned less than the $221.3million ofStar Wars,Empirewas considered a financial success. Industry experts estimated the film returned $120million to the filmmakers,[173][196][226]which recouped Lucas's investment and cleared his debt;[227]he paid out $5million in employee bonuses.[174]Box office figures are unavailable for all the releases outside of North America in 1980, althoughThe New York Timesreported the film performed well in the United Kingdom and Japan. According toVariety,Empireearned approximately $192.1million, giving the film a cumulative worldwide gross of $401.5million[vii], making it the highest-grossing film of the year.[1][2][3]Empiredid not achieve the same success asStar Wars, which Lucas blamed on its inconclusive ending.[173][229]Empirehas received multiple theatrical re-releases, including in July 1981 ($26.8million), November 1982 ($14.5million), andSpecial Edition versions(modified by Lucas) in February 1997 ($67.6million).[230]Cumulatively, these releases have raised the North American box office gross to $290.3–$292.4million.[j]It is estimated to have earned a worldwide total of $538.4–$549million.[4][5]Adjusted for inflation, the North American box office is equivalent to $920.8million, making it thethirteenth-highest-grossing film ever.[232]Reception[edit]Critical response[edit]The Empire Strikes Backreceived mixed reviews upon its initial release, a change from the positive reception ofStar Wars.[173][233][234]In March 1981, TheLos Angeles Timesreleased a summary of the leading critics' choices for top 10 films of the year: Robert Redford'sOrdinary Peopleappeared on 42 lists, whileEmpiremade it onto 24.[235]Fan reactions were decidedly mixed, with many concerned by the film's change in tone and surprising narrative revelations, particularly Leia's love for Han over Luke and Luke's relationship with Vader.[236][237]Even so, the 536 audience members polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A+"" on an A+ to F scale, with males and those under the age of 25 rating it highest.[238]Some critics believedThe Empire Strikes Backwas a good film but not as enjoyable asStar Wars.[239][240][241]They believed the tonal shift featuring darker material and more mature story lines detracted from the charm, fun, and comic silliness of the original.[239][241][242]The Wall Street Journal's Joy Gould Boyum believed it was ""absurd"" to add dramatic weight to the lightheartedStar Wars, stripping it of its innocence. Writing forThe Washington Post, Gary Arnold found the darker undercurrents and greater narrative scale interesting because it created more dramatic threads to explore.[243][241]The New Yorker'sDavid Denbyargued it was more spectacular than the original, but lacked itscampstyle.[242]The Hollywood Reporter'sArthur Knightbelieved the novelty of the original and the plethora of space opera films produced since madeEmpireseem derivative; even so, he called it the best in the genre sinceStar Wars.[240][243]Writing forTime,Gerald ClarkesaidEmpiresurpassedStar Warsin several ways, including being more visually and artistically interesting.[244]The New York Times'sVincent Canbycalled it a more mechanical, less suspenseful experience.[239]Writing for theLos Angeles Times,Charles Champlinsaid the inconclusive ending cleverly completed the narrative while serving as a cliffhanger, but Clarke called it a ""not very satisfying"" conclusion.[245][246]Canby and theChicago Reader'sDave Kehrbelieved that as the middle film, it should have focused on narrative development instead of exposition, finding little narrative progression between the film's beginning and end.[239][247][241]The Washington Post'sJudith Martinlabeled it a ""good junk"" film, enjoyable but fleeting, because it lacked a stand-alone narrative.[248]Knight and Clarke found the story sometimes difficult to follow—Knight because thethird actjumped between separate storylines, and Clarke because he missed important information in the fast-paced plot.[240][246]Kehr andSight & Sound's Richard Combs wrote that characterization seemed to be less important than special effects, visual spectacle and action set pieces that accomplished little narratively.[247][249]Reviews were mixed for the principal cast.[241][245][247]Knight wrote that Kershner's direction made the characters more human and lessarchetypal.[240]Hamill, Fisher, and Ford received some praise, with Champlin calling Hamill ""youthfully innocent"" and engaging, and Fisher independent.[240][245][250]Arnold described the character progression as less about development and more about ""finesse"", with little change taking place,[243]while Kehr felt the characters were ""stiffer"" without Lucas's direction.[247]Knight called Guinness's performance half-hearted,[240]andJanet Maslincriticized Lando Calrissian, the only major black character in the film, as ""exaggeratedly unctuous, untrustworthy and loaded withjive"".[251]TheChicago Tribune'sGene Siskelsaid the non-human characters, including the robots and Chewbacca, remained the most lovable creatures, with Yoda being the film's highlight.[252]Knight, Gould Boyum, and Arnold thought Yoda to be incredibly lifelike; Arnold considered his expressions so realistic that he believed an actor's face had beencompositedonto the puppet.[240][241][243]Canby called the human cast bland and nondescript, and said even the robot characters offered diminishing enjoyment, but Yoda was a success when used sparingly.[239]Although Arnold praised Kershner's direction, others believed that Lucas's oversight was obvious andEmpirelacked Kershner's established directorial sensibilities. Denby described his work as ""impersonal"" and Canby believed it was impossible to identify what Kershner had contributed.[239][242][243]Combs believed Kershner was an ""ill-advised"" director because he emphasized the characters, and the result was common tropes at the expense of the comic-strip pace ofStar Wars.[249]Peter Suschitzky's cinematography was praised for its visuals and bold color choices,[240][243]and the special effects were lauded as ""breathtaking"",[241]""ingenious"",[240]and visually dazzling.[243]Jim Harwoodsaid he was let down only by the familiarity of the effects from the original, which were emulated by other films.[250]Champlin appreciated that the effects were used to enhance scenes rather than being the focus.[245]Accolades[edit]ComposerJohn Williams(pictured in 2006) won twoGrammy Awardsfor his score toThe Empire Strikes Back, in addition to nominations forAcademy,Golden Globe, andBAFTAawards.At the1981 Academy Awards,The Empire Strikes Backwon the award forBest Sound(Bill Varney,Steve Maslow,Gregg Landaker, andPeter Sutton) and aSpecial Achievement Academy AwardforBest Visual Effects(Brian Johnson,Richard Edlund,Dennis Muren, andBruce Nicholson). The film received a further two nominations:Best Art Direction(Norman Reynolds,Leslie Dilley,Harry Lange,Alan Tomkins, andMichael Ford) andBest Original Score(John Williams).[253]Williams also won twoGrammy Awards:Best Instrumental CompositionandBest Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.[254]He earned the film's soleGolden Globe Awardsnomination, forBest Original Score.[255]The34th British Academy Film AwardsgarneredEmpireone award forBest Music(Williams), and two additional nominations:Best Sound(Sutton, Varney, andBen Burtt) andBest Production Design(Reynolds).[256]At the8th Saturn Awards,Empirereceived four awards:Best Science Fiction Film,Best Director(Irvin Kershner),Best Actor(Mark Hamill), andBest Special Effects(Johnson and Edlund).[257]The film also won aHugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentationand aPeople's Choice Awardfor Favorite Motion Picture.[258][259]Post-release[edit]Special Edition and other changes[edit]Main articles:Changes in Star Wars re-releasesandThe People vs. George LucasAs part of his plan to develop aprequel trilogy of filmsin the late 1990s, Lucas remastered and rereleased the original trilogy, includingEmpire, under the titleStar Wars Trilogy: Special Editionto test special effects. This included altering scenes or adding new scenes, some of which tied into the prequel films. Lucas described it as bringing the trilogy closer to his original vision with modern technology. Among the alterations were full shots of the wampa andcomputer-generatedlocations with added buildings or people.[260]These editions were well received by critics.Roger EbertcalledEmpirethe best and ""heart"" of the original trilogy.[261][262][263]Since their initial release, the Special Editions have been altered multiple times. For the 2004 rerelease, the Clive Revill/Elaine Baker Emperor was replaced byIan McDiarmid, who had performed the role sinceReturn of the Jedi(1983).[260]Temuera Morrison, who portrayed Fett's clone predecessor inStar Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones(2002), dubbed over Wingreen's lines.[99]Minor changes were made for the 2011 Blu-ray release, including adding flames to the probe droid's impact crater and color modifications.[264][265]The Special Edition releases were controversial with fans, who considered the changes to the original films unnecessary or too substantial.[260][266]The unaltered versions have been commercially unavailable since a 2006 DVD release, which used unrestored footage from an early 1990sLaserdiscrelease.Harmy's Despecialized Editionis an unofficial fan effort to preserve the unaltered films.[267][268]The 2010 documentaryThe People vs. George Lucasdocuments the relationship between the films, their fans, and Lucas.[269]Home media[edit]Empirewas released onVHS,Laserdisc, andCEDvideodisc formats at Christmas 1984. The VHS cost $79.95 and became the top-selling tape at that price point at the time with sales of 375,000 units.[270]The VHS and Laserdisc versions received various releases in the following years, often alongside the other original trilogy films in collections, with minor alterations such aswidescreen formatsor remastered sound. The 1992 Special Collector's Edition included the documentaryFrom Star Wars to Jedi: The Making of a Saga. In 1997, the Special Edition of the original trilogy was released on VHS.[271][272]When the film debuted on television in November 1987, it was preceded by a second-person introduction by Darth Vader, framed as an interruption of the Earth broadcast by the Galactic Empire.[273][274]The film was released onDVDin 2004, collected withStar WarsandReturn of the Jedi, with additional alterations to each film. The release included the documentaryEmpire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy, about the making of the original trilogy.[275]Lucas said the modified versions were the way he had wanted them to be, and he had no interest in restoring the original theatrical cuts for release. Public demand eventually led to the release of the 2006 Limited Edition DVD collection that included the original unmodified films transferred from the 1993 Laserdisc Definitive Edition, creating problems with the image display.[271]Empirewas released onBlu-rayin 2011, as part of a collection containing the Special Edition original trilogy and a separate version containing the original and prequel trilogies alongsidefeaturettesabout the making of the films.[264][276][277]In 2015,Empireand the other available films were releaseddigitallyon various platforms. A4K resolutionversion—restored from the 1997 Special Edition print—was released in 2019 onDisney+.[278][279]In 2020, a 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set was released, which contained all nine films in the series. It featured a Blu-ray version and a4K Ultra HD Blu-rayversion of each film, as well as special features from the 2011 release.[280]Other media[edit]See also:Star WarsfranchiseandList of Star Wars video gamesMerchandise forThe Empire Strikes Backincludes posters, children's books, clothing, character busts and statues, action figures, furnishings, andLegosets.[k]Thenovelizationof the film, written byDonald F.

W. Rinzlerprovides a comprehensive history of the film's production, including behind-the-scenes photos and cast interviews.[284][289]The film was the first in the series to be adapted for video games, beginning withStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Back(1982) developed byParker Brothersfor theAtari 2600games console.[290][291]This was followed in 1985 by theStar Wars: The Empire Strikes Backarcade game.[292]Star Wars Trilogy Arcade(1998) features the Hoth battle as alevel.[292]Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Backwas released in 1992 for theNintendo Entertainment SystemandGame Boy, andSuper Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Backfollowed in 1993 for theSuper Nintendo Entertainment System.[291]Scenes fromEmpirehave also appeared in games likeStar Wars: Rogue Squadron(1998) andStar Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron(2007).[291][293]The Empire Strikes Backpinballmachine (1980) was the first officially licensedStar Warspinball machine. It became a collector's item, as only 350 machines were produced exclusively in Australia.[292]Thematic analysis[edit]See also:Star Wars sources and analoguesMythology and inspirations[edit]Critical analysis has suggested various inspirations forEmpire, particularly the early 1930sFlash Gordonserials that include a cloud city similar to Bespin. Film critic Tim Robey wrote that much ofEmpire's imagery and narrative can be connected to the 1975 filmDersu Uzala, directed byAkira Kurosawa—whose work inspired Lucas.[294][295]Muren described the Empire's assault on Hoth with AT-AT vehicles as an analogy for theVietnam War, specifically an invading military employing equipment inappropriate for the local terrain.[296]Clarke identified Luke as the heir to mythological heroes, such asPrometheus,Jason, andGalahad. He is guided initially by a traditional aide, Obi-Wan, who offers the promise of destiny until he is replaced by Yoda.[297]Anne Lancashire wrote that the Yoda narrative is a traditional mythological tale in which the hero is trained by a wise old master and must abandon all his preconceived notions.[298]Clarke describedLuke's journeyas the hero who ventures into the unknown to be tested by his own dark impulses but eventually overcomes them. He believed this represented the human ability to control irrational impulsiveness to serve love, order, and justice.[297]Lucas wanted Yoda to be a traditional fairy-tale or mythological character, akin to a frog or an unassuming old man, to instill a message about respecting everyone and not judging on appearance alone, because he believed that would lead the hero to succeed.[299]The New York Observer's Brandon Katz described Yoda as deepening the Force through philosophy. Yoda says they are all luminous beings beyond just flesh and matter, and presents the Jedi asZenwarriors who work in harmony with the Force. Kasdan described them as enlightened warrior priests, similar toSamurai.[285][299]Religion[edit]In developing the Force, Lucas said he wanted it to represent the core essence of multiple religions unified by their common traits. Primarily, he designed it with the intent that there is good, evil, and a god. Lucas's personal faith includes abelief in Godand basic morality, such as treating others fairly and not taking another's life.The Presbyterian Journaldescribed the film's religious message as closer toEastern religionssuch asZoroastrianismorBuddhismthanJudeo-Christian, presentinggood and evilas abstract concepts. Similarly, God or the Force is an impersonal entity, taking nodirect action.Christianity Todaysaid that the film's drama is caused by the absence of a righteous god or being creating a direct influence.[285]Lancashire and J. W. Rinzler described Luke's journey as based purely on Christianity, focused on destiny andfree will, with Luke serving as aChrist-like figure and Vader as afallen angelattempting to lure him toward evil.[300][285]Kershner said any religious symbolism was unintentional, as he wanted to focus on the power of an individual's untapped potential instead of magic.[285]Duality and evil[edit]Anne Lancashire contrasted the firstStar Warsfilm's message of idealism, heroics, and friendship with the more complex tone ofEmpire.[301]The latter challenges the former's notions, primarily because Luke loses his innocence in coming to perceive people as neither entirely good nor evil.[302][303]The scene in which Luke enters the dark side cave on Dagobah represents where his anger will lead him and forces him to move beyond his belief that he is completely on the light side of the Force.[297][298]Kershner said the cave tests Luke against his greatest fear, but because the fear is in his mind, and he brought his weapon with him, it creates a scenario where he is forced to use it.[304]After defeating the avatar of Vader, the mask splits open to reveal Luke's face, suggesting he will succumb to the temptations of the dark side unless he learns patience and to abandon his anger.[305]The darkness is similarly presented in Han, a self-interested smuggler struggling with his growing feelings for Leia and the responsibility associated with her cause. The film represents his two sides in Leia and Lando, a representative of his smuggler life.[306]Empirequestions the cost of friendship. WhereStar Warspresents traditional friendship,Empirepresents friendship as requiring sacrifice. Han sacrifices himself in the frigid cold of Hoth to save Luke's life.[302][307]Similarly, Luke abandons his Jedi training, something he has longed for, to rescue his friends. This can be seen as a selfish choice, as he does so against Yoda and Obi-Wan's instructions, potentially sacrificing himself for his friends instead of training to defeat the Empire, a cause his friends support.[302][307]According to Lancashire, characters are shown to be heroic through sacrificing for others instead of fighting battles.[308]Lancashire believed that Luke's impatience to leave for Bespin exemplifies his lack of growth from his training.[305]There, Vader tempts him with the power of the dark side and the revelation that he is Luke's father.[285][297]Vader wants Luke's help to destroy the Emperor, not for good, but so that Vader can impose his own order over the galaxy.[285]This admission robs Luke of the idealized image of his Jedi father, reveals Obi-Wan's deception in hiding his parentage, and takes the last of his innocence.[302][309][310]Gerald Clarke suggests Luke is not strong or virtuous enough to resist Vader during this confrontation, and so allows himself to fall into the airshaft below, showing the antagonist does sometimes win.[297][302]The concept of a character having a good father and an evil father is a common story trope because of its simple representations of good and evil.[285]At the film's finale, Luke has a greater understanding of the relationship between good and evil, and thedual natureof people.[311]Legacy[edit]Critical reassessment[edit]The Empire Strikes Backremains an enduringly popular piece of cinema.[177]It is considered groundbreaking for itscliffhangerending, influence on mainstream films, and special effects.[l]Brian Lowry ofCNNwrote that without the ""groundwork laid by one of the best sequels ever, [theStar Warsfranchise] wouldn't be the force that it is now"".[316]Despite the film's initial mixed reception, it has since been reevaluated by critics and fans and is now often considered the best film in theStar Warsseries, and one of thegreatest films ever made.[m]In 2014, members of the entertainment industry rankedEmpireas the 32nd-best film of all time in a poll conducted byThe Hollywood Reporter(Star Warswas #11).[327]Empiremagazine named it the third-best film of all time, stating that the modern cliché of sequels employing a darker tone can be traced back toEmpire.[319]A 1997 retrospective review by Roger Ebert declared the film the best of the original trilogy, praising the depth of its storytelling and its ability to create a sense of wonder in the audience.[328]A vote by 250,000Business Insiderreaders in 2014 listed it as the greatest film ever made; it is also included in the 2013 film reference book1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.[329][330]The revelation that Vader is Luke's father continues to be seen as one of the greatestplot twistsin cinema.[n]Similarly, Han saying ""I know"" in response to Leia's love confession is considered one of the most iconic scenes in theStar Warsfilms and one of the more famous lines of improvised dialogue in cinema.[o]Empiremagazine selected the film as the sixth greatest movie sequel, lauding the ""bold"" unresolved ending and willingness to avoid the same formula as the first film.[342]Den of Geekcalled it the second-best sequel—afterAliens(1986)—and hailed it as Lucas's ""masterpiece"".[317]Playboynamed it the third-best sequel, describing the disclosure of the relationship between Luke and Vader as the ""emotional core that has elevatedStar Warsto the pantheon of timeless modern sagas"".[318]TheBBCandColliderlisted it as one of the best sequels ever made,[343][344]whileTimeandPlayboydescribed it as a sequel that surpasses the original.[318][345]Review aggregatorRotten Tomatoesrecognizes it as the 27th-best sequel, based on review scores.[346]Rolling Stone's 2014 reader-voted list of the best sequels listedEmpireat third.[347]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 93% of 169 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 9/10. The website's consensus reads: ""Dark, sinister, but ultimately even more involving thanA New Hope,The Empire Strikes Backdefies viewer expectations and takes the series to heightened emotional levels.""[348]Empirehas a score of 82 out of 100 onMetacriticbased on the reviews of 25 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[349]Characters introduced in the film, such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian, are now considered iconic.[p]TheAmerican Film Instituteranked Darth Vader as the third best villain on its 2003 list of the100 Best Heroes & Villains, afterNorman BatesandHannibal Lecter.[355]Cultural influence[edit]See also:Cultural impact ofStar WarsThe Empire Strikes Backwas ubiquitous in American culture upon its release.[227]Freddie Mercuryended a 1980Queenconcert by riding on the shoulders of someone dressed as Darth Vader.[211][356][357]The film was referenced inpolitical cartoons.[227]Kershner received letters from fans around the world asking for autographs, and from psychologists who had used Yoda to explain philosophical ideas to their patients.[336]Other films, television shows, and video games have extensively referenced or parodied the film,[358][359]including theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU),[360]Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,Spaceballs,Toy Story 2,Logorama,Buffy the Vampire Slayer,Stargate Universe,The Muppet Show,The Fairly OddParents,Futurama,American Dad!,South Park,Aqua Teen Hunger Force,The Venture Bros.,[358]The Simpsons,[361]Robot Chicken,Family Guyand its subsequentparody trilogy.[362]In 2010, the United StatesLibrary of CongressselectedThe Empire Strikes Backfor preservation in theNational Film Registryfor being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[363][364]Landon Palmer, Eric Diaz, and Darren Mooney argue thatEmpire, and notStar Wars, created the concept of the modern blockbuster film franchise, which includes sequels serving as chapters in an infinitely expanding narrative—a template which was embraced by other film properties in the decades followingEmpire's release. This new paradigm stood in opposition to the popular trend of exploiting a successful film by creating low-budget sequels (which resulted in diminishing returns, as happened with theJawsfranchise).[365][366][367]Instead, more money was spent onEmpireto expand the fictional universe and reap greater box-office returns. The use of a cliffhanger ending to set up a future sequel is seen in many modern films, particularly those in the MCU.[365]It has also been suggested thatEmpireforged a narrative structure that continues to be emulated in trilogies, wherein the middle film is darker than the original and features an ending in which the protagonists fail to defeat the antagonists (which sets up a subsequent film). Emmet Asher-Perrin and Ben Sherlock cite the seriesBack to the Future,The Matrix,The Lord of the Rings, andPirates of the Caribbeanas examples.[368][369]Filmmakers such as theRusso brothers,Roland Emmerich, andKevin Feige, and actors such asNeil Patrick Harris,Jim Carrey, andJude Law, citeEmpireas an inspiration in their careers or identify as fans.[q]Sequels, prequels, and adaptations[edit]Main articles:Return of the Jedi,Star Wars prequel trilogy, andStar Wars sequel trilogyThe Empire Strikes Backwas adapted into a1982 radio playbroadcast onNational Public Radioin the United States.[376]Return of the Jediwas released in 1983, concluding the original film trilogy.Jedi's plot follows the Rebel assault on the Empire and Luke's final confrontation with Vader and the Emperor. Like the previous films,Jediwas a financial success and fared well with critics.[377][378]Nearly two decades after the release ofEmpire, Lucas wrote and directed theprequel trilogy, consisting ofThe Phantom Menace(1999),Attack of the Clones(2002), andRevenge of the Sith(2005). The films chronicle the history between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, and the latter's fall to the dark side and transformation into Darth Vader. The storylines and certain new characters in the prequel films polarized critics and fans.[r]After Lucas sold theStar Warsfranchise tothe Walt Disney Companyin 2012, Disney developed asequel trilogy, consisting ofThe Force Awakens(2015),The Last Jedi(2017), andThe Rise of Skywalker(2019).[s]Original trilogy cast members—including Ford, Hamill, and Fisher—reprised their roles, and were joined by new characters portrayed byDaisy Ridley,John Boyega,Adam Driver, andOscar Isaac.[388]Standalone filmsandtelevision serieshave also been released, with narratives relating to the story arcs of the original trilogy.[t]Footnotes[edit]^This figure represents the cumulative total accounting for the initial worldwide 1980 gross of $401.5million and subsequent releases thereafter.[1][2][3][4][5]^Later retitledStar Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope.^As depicted inStar Wars, also known asEpisode IV – A New Hope(1977).^As depicted inReturn of the Jedi(1983)^Marjorie Eatonwas filmed as the Emperor in February 1980, but her screen test was rejected.

It starsRobin Williams, Damon, Affleck,Stellan SkarsgårdandMinnie Driver. The film tells the story of janitor Will Hunting, whose mathematical genius is discovered by a professor atMIT.The film received acclaim from critics and grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run against a $10 million budget. At the70th Academy Awards, it received nominations in nine categories, includingBest PictureandBest Director, and won in two:Best Supporting Actorfor Williams andBest Original Screenplayfor Affleck and Damon. In 2014, it was ranked at number 53 inThe Hollywood Reporter's ""100 Favorite Films"" list.[4]Plot[edit]Twenty-year-old Will Hunting ofSouth Bostonis a self-taught math genius who was recently paroled after completing a prison term. He works as a janitor atMIT, and spends his free time drinking with his friends Chuckie, Billy and Morgan.When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficultgraph theorymathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. He later catches Will writing the solution on the blackboard late at night, but initially thinks Will is vandalizing it and chases him off. At a bar, Will meets Skylar, an English woman about to graduate fromHarvard College, who plans on attending medical school atStanford.Meanwhile, Lambeau, realizing Will was not vandalizing the problem but solving it, asks the campus maintenance staff his whereabouts, but is informed he did not turn up for work. Lambeau learns Will was placed at MIT by a parole program, and obtains his parole officer's details.Will and his friends start a fight with a gang that includes a member who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for Will to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in psychotherapy sessions. Will agrees but treats his therapists with mockery.In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology atBunker Hill Community College. Unlike the other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's defense mechanisms. During the first session, Will insults his deceased wife, and Sean threatens him, but after a few unproductive sessions, Will finally begins to open up.Will is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife, who later died of cancer, by giving up his ticket tothe historic game sixof the1975 World Seriesafter falling in love at first sight. Sean's explanation for surrendering his ticket was to ""see about a girl"", and he does not regret his decision. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his home. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.Lambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but he scorns them by sending Chuckie as his ""chief negotiator"", and by turning down a position at theNSAwith a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him.Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out to Will that he is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that hedeliberately sabotagesthem to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling him he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is the brief moment when he waits at his doorstep, thinking Will has moved on to something greater.Will walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over Will's potential. Lambeau leaves, and Sean and Will talk and it comes to light that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps him see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that the abuse he received was not his fault by repeatedly stating, ""It's not your fault"", causing him to break down in tears in Sean's arms. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will manage his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau, deciding to take a sabbatical.Will's friends give him a used car for his 21st birthday so he can commute to work. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness, as Will had finally done what Chuckie had been wishing for all these years. Will leaves a note for Sean asking him to tell Lambeau that he had to go ""see about a girl"", revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.Cast[edit]Matt Damonas Will HuntingRobin Williamsas Dr. Sean MaguireBen Affleckas Chuckie SullivanStellan Skarsgårdas Professor Gerald LambeauMinnie Driveras SkylarCasey Affleckas Morgan O'MallyCole Hauseras Billy McBrideJohn Mightonas TomScott William Wintersas ClarkJimmy Flynnas Judge George H. MaloneChristopher Brittonas Executive #2Alison Follandas MIT StudentGeorge Plimptonas Henry LipkinProduction[edit]Development[edit]Matt Damonstarted writing the film as a final assignment for a playwriting class that he was taking atHarvard University.[5]Instead of writing a one-act play, Damon submitted a 40-page script.[5]He wrote into his script his then-girlfriend, medical student Skylar Satenstein (credited in the closing credits of the film).[6]Damon said that the only scene from that script to survive verbatim was when Will (Damon) meets his therapist, Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), for the first time.[5]Damon askedBen Affleckto develop the screenplay with him. They completed the script in 1994.[5]At first, it was written as a thriller about a young man in the rough-and-tumble streets ofSouth Bostonwho possesses a superior intelligence and is targeted by the government with heavy-handed recruitment.[5]Castle Rock Entertainmentbought the script for $675,000 against $775,000, meaning that Damon and Affleck would earn an additional $100,000 if the film was produced, and they retained sole writing credit.[citation needed]Castle Rock Entertainment presidentRob Reinerurged them to drop the thriller aspect of the story and to focus on the relationship between Will and his therapist.Terrence Malicktold Affleck and Damon over dinner that the film ought to end with Will's decision to follow his girlfriend Skylar to California, not them leaving together.[7]At Reiner's request, screenwriterWilliam Goldmanread the script. Goldman consistently denied the persistent rumor that he wroteGood Will Huntingor acted as ascript doctor. In his bookWhich Lie Did I Tell?, Goldman jokingly writes, ""I did not just doctor it. I wrote the whole thing from scratch,"" before dismissing the rumor as false and saying that his only advice was agreeing with Reiner's suggestion.[8]Affleck and Damonproposed to act in the lead roles, but many studio executives said that they wantedBrad PittandLeonardo DiCaprio.[9]Meanwhile,Kevin Smithwas working with Affleck onMallrats, and with both Damon and Affleck onChasing Amy.[10]Castle Rock Entertainment put the script in turnaround and gave Damon and Affleck 30 days to find another buyer for the script who would reimburse Castle Rock Entertainment the money paid; otherwise the script would be reverted to Castle Rock Entertainment, and Damon and Affleck would be out. All of the studios that were involved in the original bidding war for the screenplay turned the pair down, taking meetings with Affleck and Damon only to tell them this to their face.As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to hisChasing Amydirector Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly intoHarvey Weinstein's office atMiramax Films. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock Entertainment their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. Weinstein asked that a few scenes be removed, including an out-of-place, mid-scriptoral sexscene that Damon and Affleck added to trick executives who were not looking closely.[5]After buying the rights from Castle Rock Entertainment, Miramax Films put the film into production. Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, includingMel GibsonandMichael Mann.[11]Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith whether he was interested in directing. He declined, saying that they needed a ""good director"",[12]that he directed only projects that he wrote, and that he was not much of a visual director, but he still served as one of the film's co-executive producers. Damon and Affleck choseGus Van Sant, whose work on previous films, likeDrugstore Cowboy, had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters. Miramax Films was persuaded and hired Van Sant to direct the film.[13][14][15]Filming[edit]TheAu Bon PaininHarvard Squarewhere Skylar asked Will to explain his ""photographic memory"" to her (as seen in 2013; it has since been redeveloped by Harvard)Filming took place between April and June 1997. Although the story is set in Boston, and many of the scenes were shot on location in theGreater Boston area, many of the interior shots were filmed at locations in Toronto, with theUniversity of Torontostanding in for MIT and Harvard University. The classroom scenes were filmed at McLennan Physical Laboratories (of the University of Toronto) andCentral Technical School. Harvard normally disallows filming on its property, but permitted limited filming by the project after intervention by Harvard alumnusJohn Lithgow.[16]Likewise, only the exterior shots ofBunker Hill Community Collegewere filmed in Boston; however, Sean's office was built in Toronto as an exact replica of one at the college.[17]The interior bar scenes set in ""Southie"" were shot on location atWoody's L Street Tavern.[18]Meanwhile, the homes of Will (190 West 6th Street) and Sean (259 E Street), although portrayed as some distance apart in the film, are actually next door to each other on Bowen Street, the narrow street that Chuckie drives on to walk up to Will's back door.[19][20]The Bow and Arrow Pub, which was located at the corner of Bow Street and Massachusetts Avenue inCambridge, doubled as the exterior of the Harvard bar in which Will meets Skylar for the first time.[21]TheBaskin-Robbins/Dunkin' Donutsfeatured in the ""How do you likethemapples?"" scene was next door to the pub at the time of the film's release.[20]The Harvard Bar interior scenes were filmed at the Upfront Bar and Grill on Front St. E. in Toronto.[22]The Tasty, at the corner of JFK and Brattle Streets, was the scene of Will and Skylar's first kiss.[23]TheAu Bon Pain, where Will and Skylar discuss the former'sphotographic memory, was at the corner of Dunster Street and Mass Ave.[24]TheBoston Public Gardenbench on which Will and Sean sat for a scene in the film became a temporary shrine after Williams's death in 2014.[25]The film's end-credits roll over a continuous shot of the car Hunting is driving to California, with the songs ""Miss Misery"" and ""Afternoon Delight"" playing on the soundtrack. It was shot on a stretch of theMassachusetts Turnpike. The car eventually disappears down the road after passing under the bridge carrying theWest Stockbridge Road.[26]Soundtrack[edit]Good Will Hunting: Music from the Miramax Motion PictureSoundtrack albumbyVarious artistsReleasedDecember 2, 1997GenreSoundtrackindie rockacoustic rockindie folkLength52:16LabelCapitolThe musical score forGood Will Huntingwas composed byDanny Elfman, who had previously collaborated with Gus Van Sant onTo Die Forand would go on to score many of Van Sant's other films.[27]The film also features many songs written and recorded by singer-songwriterElliott Smith. His song ""Miss Misery"" was nominated for theAcademy Award for Best Original Song, but lost to ""My Heart Will Go On"" fromTitanic.[28]Elfman's score was also nominated for anOscarbut lost toTitanicas well.

Glashow referred Damon to his brother-in-law,Daniel Kleitman, a mathematics professor at MIT.Columbia Universityphysics and math professorBrian Greeneat theTribecaSloanretrospectively explained that for physics, ""Having some deep insight about the universe [⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠.⁠ ⁠] typically [⁠ ⁠is ⁠] a group project in the modern era"", while ""doing some mathematical theorem is a singular undertaking very often"".[32][33]Patrick O'Donnell, professor of physics at theUniversity of Toronto, served as the mathematical consultant for the film.[34]In the spring of 1997, Damon and Affleck asked Kleitman to ""speak math to us"" for writing realistic dialogue, so Kleitman invited postdocTom Bohmanto join him, giving them a ""quick lecture"". When asked for a problem that Will could solve, Kleitman and Bohman suggested the unsolved computer scienceP versus NP problem, but the film used other problems. The plot was inspired byGeorge Dantzig's real life story.[35]The main hallway blackboard is used twice to reveal Will's talent, first to the audience, and second to Professor Lambeau. Damon based it on his artist brother Kyle visiting MIT'sInfinite Corridorand writing ""an incredibly elaborate, totally fake, version of an equation"" on a blackboard, which lasted for months. Kyle returned to Matt, saying that MIT needed those blackboards ""because these kids are so smart they just need to, you know, drop everything and solve problems!"".[36]The first blackboard problem[edit]Near the start of the film, Will sets aside his mop to study a difficult problem posed by Lambeau on the blackboard.[37]The problem has to do with intermediate-levelgraph theory, but Lambeau describes it as an advanced ""Fouriersystem"".To answer the first part of the question, Will chalks up anadjacency matrix:A=(0101102102001100).{\displaystyle A={\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0&1\\1&0&2&1\\0&2&0&0\\1&1&0&0\end{pmatrix}}.}To answer the second part, he determines the number of 3-stepwalksin the graph, and finds the third power matrix:A3=(272372127212023722).{\displaystyle A^{3}={\begin{pmatrix}2&7&2&3\\7&2&12&7\\2&12&0&2\\3&7&2&2\end{pmatrix}}.}The third and fourth parts of the question concerngenerating functions. The other characters are astounded that a janitor shows such facility withmatrices.The second blackboard problem[edit]Lambeau subsequently poses a new challenge on the blackboard: stateCayley's formulaand ""draw all the homeomorphically irreducible trees withn=10{\displaystyle n=10}"". Will writes eight of the ten trees correctly before Lambeau interrupts.[38][unreliable source?]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]In the film's opening weekend in limited release, it grossed $272,912. When it opened nationwide in January 1998, it grossed $10,261,471 for the weekend. It went on to gross $138,433,435 in the United States and Canada, surpassingPulp Fictionas Miramax's highest grossing film in that market at the time.[39]It grossed $225,933,435 worldwide.[3]Critical response[edit]Good Will Huntingreceived widespread acclaim from critics. On thereview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97%, based on 91 reviews, with an average rating of 8.10/10. The website's critical consensus reads: ""It follows a predictable narrative arc, butGood Will Huntingadds enough quirks to the journey – and is loaded with enough powerful performances – that it remains an entertaining, emotionally rich drama.""[40]OnMetacritic, the film has aweighted averagescore of 71 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating ""generally favorable"" reviews.[41]Audiences surveyed byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A"" on a scale of A+ to F.[42]Roger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film three stars out of four, writing that while the story is ""predictable"", it is ""the individual moments, not the payoff, that make it so effective"".[43]Duane Byrge ofThe Hollywood Reporterpraised the performances of the cast, writing, ""The acting is brilliant overall, with special praise to Matt Damon for his ragingly tender portrayal of the boy cursed with genius.""[44]Peter Stack of theSan Francisco Chroniclewas equally positive, writing, ""The glow goes well beyond a radiant performance by Matt Damon ... Intimate, heartfelt and wickedly funny, it's a movie whose impact lingers.""[45]Owen Gleiberman, writing forEntertainment Weekly, gave the film a ""B"", stating, ""Good Will Huntingis stuffed – indeed, overstuffed – with heart, soul, audacity, and blarney. You may not believe a minute of it, but you don't necessarily want to stop watching."" He also noted Damon's and Williams's chemistry, describing it as ""a quicksilver intercepting each other's thoughts"".[46]Janet MaslinofThe New York Timescalled the screenplay ""smart and touching"", and praised Van Sant for directing with ""style, shrewdness and clarity"". She also complimented theproduction designandcinematography, which were able to effortlessly move the viewer from ""classroom to dorm room to neighborhood bar"", in a small setting.[47]Quentin Curtis ofThe Daily Telegraphopined that Williams's performance brought ""sharpness and tenderness"", calling the film a ""crowd-pleaser, with bags of charm to spare. It doesn't bear thinking too much about its message ... Damon and Affleck's writing has real wit and vigour, and some depth.""[48]Andrew O'Hehir ofSalonstated that despite the ""enjoyable characters"", he thought that the film was somewhat superficial, writing, ""there isn't a whole lot of movie to take home with you ... many will wake the next morning wondering why, with all that talent on hand, it amounts to so little in the end.""[49]Writing for theBBC, Nev Pierce gave the film four stars out of five, describing it as ""touching, without being sentimental"", although he felt that some scenes were ""odd lapses into self-help speak"".[50]Emanuel LevyofVarietycalled the film a ""beautifully realized tale ... engaging and often quite touching"". He felt that the film's visual style showcased Van Sant's talent, but the plot was ""quite predictable"".[51]Academic response[edit]Several scholars have examined the role of class, religion and the cultural geography of Boston in the film. Jeffrey Herlihy-Mera observed that theresidual Catholic–Protestant tensions in Bostonare an important backdrop in the film, asIrish CatholicsfromSouthieare aligned against ostensiblyProtestantcharacters who are affiliated withHarvardandMIT.[52]Emmett Winn has argued that character interactions show class conflict and stunted social mobility,[53]while, similarly, David Lipset commented that class inequality is a driving subtext.[54]Accolades[edit]AwardCategoryNominee(s)ResultRef.Academy AwardsBest PictureLawrence BenderNominated[55]Best DirectorGus Van SantNominatedBest ActorMatt DamonNominatedBest Supporting ActorRobin WilliamsWonBest Supporting ActressMinnie DriverNominatedBest Screenplay – Written Directly for the ScreenMatt Damon andBen AffleckWonBest Film EditingPietro ScaliaNominatedBest Original Dramatic ScoreDanny ElfmanNominatedBest Original Song""Miss Misery""Music and Lyrics byElliott SmithNominatedAmerican Cinema Editors AwardsBest Edited Feature FilmPietro ScaliaNominatedBerlin International Film FestivalGolden BearGus Van SantNominated[56]Outstanding Single AchievementMatt DamonWonBlockbuster Entertainment AwardsFavorite Actor – VideoWonFavorite Actress – VideoMinnie DriverNominatedBMI Film & TV AwardsFilm Music AwardDanny ElfmanWonBoston Society of Film Critics AwardsBest ScreenplayMatt Damon and Ben Affleck3rd Place[57]Chicago Film Critics Association AwardsMost Promising ActorBen AffleckNominated[58]Matt DamonWonChlotrudis AwardsBest ScreenplayMatt Damon and Ben AffleckNominated[59]Critics' Choice AwardsBest PictureNominated[60]Best Original ScreenplayMatt Damon and Ben AffleckWonBreakthrough ArtistMatt DamonWonDallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association AwardsBest FilmNominatedDirectors Guild of America AwardsOutstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion PicturesGus Van SantNominated[61][62]Empire AwardsBest FilmNominated[63]European Film AwardsOutstanding European Achievement in World CinemaStellan SkarsgårdWon[64]Florida Film Critics Circle AwardsBest NewcomerMatt Damon and Ben AffleckWon[65]Golden Globe AwardsBest Motion Picture – DramaNominated[66][67]Best Actor in a Motion Picture – DramaMatt DamonNominatedBest Supporting Actor – Motion PictureRobin WilliamsNominatedBest Screenplay – Motion PictureMatt Damon and Ben AffleckWonGolden Reel AwardsBest Sound Editing – Music (Domestic and Foreign)Kenneth KarmanNominatedGolden Trailer AwardsBest DramaWonHumanitas PrizeFeature FilmMatt Damon and Ben AffleckWon[68]Japan Academy Film PrizeOutstanding Foreign Language FilmNominatedKey Art AwardsHome Entertainment Audio/Visual TrailerR.D.

Directed byRoger AllersandRob Minkoff, and produced byDon Hahn, the film's screenplay was written byIrene Mecchi,Jonathan Roberts, andLinda Woolverton, and features anensemble voice castconsisting ofMatthew Broderick,James Earl Jones,Jeremy Irons,Jonathan Taylor Thomas,Moira Kelly, Niketa Calame,Nathan Lane,Ernie Sabella,Whoopi Goldberg,Cheech Marin,Rowan Atkinson, andRobert Guillaume. The film follows a young lion,Simba, who flees his kingdom when his father, KingMufasa, is murdered by his uncle,Scar. After growing up inexile, Simba returns home to confront his uncle and reclaim his throne.The Lion Kingwas conceived during conversations among various Disney executives, to whom several writers submitted earlytreatments. Original directorGeorge Scribnerhad envisionedThe Lion Kingas anature documentary-style film, with Allers joining as co-director after having worked in the story departments of several successful animated Disney films. Considered to be Disney's first original animated film,The Lion King's plot draws inspiration from several sources, notablyWilliam Shakespeare's playHamlet. Woolverton, screenwriter for Disney'sBeauty and the Beast(1991), drafted early versions ofThe Lion King's script, which Mecchi and Roberts were hired to revise once Woolverton left to prioritize other projects. Scribner departed due to disagreements over the studio's decision to reimagine the film as a musical, with original songs byElton JohnandTim Rice, and Minkoff was hired to replace him in April 1992. Throughout production, the creative team visited Kenya for research and inspiration.Released on June 15, 1994,The Lion Kingwas praised by critics for its music, story, themes, and animation. With an initial worldwide gross of $763 million, it completed its theatrical run as thehighest-grossing film of 1994and thesecond-highest-grossing film of all time, behindJurassic Park(1993). It held the title ofhighest-grossing animated filmuntil it was replaced byFinding Nemoin 2003. The film remains thehighest-grossing traditionally animated film of all time, as well as thebest-selling filmonhome video, having sold over55 millioncopies worldwide. It won twoAcademy Awards, as well as theGolden Globe AwardforBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. It is considered by many to be among thegreatest animated films ever made.The success of the film launched amultibillion-dollar franchisecomprising aBroadway adaptation, twodirect-to-videofollow-ups, two television series, and aphotorealistic remake(which itself spawned aprequel), which in 2019 also became the highest-grossing animated film at the time of its release. In 2016,The Lion Kingwas selected for preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressas being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".PlotIn the Pride Lands ofTanzania, a pride of lions rules over the kingdom from Pride Rock. KingMufasaand QueenSarabi's newborn son,Simba, is presented to the gathered animals byRafiki, themandrillwho serves as the kingdom'sshamanand advisor. Mufasa's younger brother,Scar, covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba so that he may become king.When Simba grows into a young cub, Mufasa shows him the Pride Lands and forbids him from exploring beyond its borders. Mufasa explains to Simba the responsibilities of kingship and the ""circle of life,"" which connects all living things. Scar manipulates Simba into exploring anelephants' graveyardbeyond the Pride Lands. There, Simba and his best friend,Nala, are chased by threespotted hyenasnamedShenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Mufasa is alerted by hismajordomo, the hornbillZazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed in Simba for disobeying him and endangering himself and Nala, Mufasa forgives him. He explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar visits the hyenas andconvincesthem to help him kill Mufasa and Simba in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.Scar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa. He lures Simba into a gorge and signals the hyenas to drive a large herd ofwildebeestsinto astampedeto trample him. Scar alerts Mufasa, who saves Simba and tries to escape the gorge; he begs Scar for help, but Scar betrays him by throwing him into the stampede to his death. Scar then deceives Simba into believing that Mufasa's death was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill Simba, but Simba escapes. Unaware of Simba's survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both Mufasa and Simba, and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands.Simba collapses in a desert but is rescued by two outcasts, ameerkatand awarthognamedTimon and Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in theiroasis, living a carefree life under their motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" inSwahili). Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who is revealed to be Nala. Simba and Nalafall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have becomedrought-stricken under Scar's reign. Still feeling guilty over Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and leaves angrily. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa’s spirit lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his place as king. After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who shames Simba over his supposed role in Mufasa’s death. Scar then reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba retaliates and forces Scar to confess the truth to the pride. A battle ensues between Simba and his allies and the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to deceive Simba by blaming his actions on the hyenas. Simba spares Scar's life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar refuses and attacks Simba. Following a brief battle, Simba throws Scar off the ledge. Scar survives the fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and maul him to death.With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his place as king, and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, thus continuing the circle of life.Voice castMain article:List ofThe Lion KingcharactersA promotional image of the characters from the film.

Disney, andPeter Schneiderwith a ""Bambiin Africa"" idea with lions. Katzenberg balked at the idea at first, but nevertheless encouraged Fink and his writers to develop a mythos to explain how lions serviced other animals by eating them.[10]Another anecdote states that the idea was conceived during a conversation between Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney, and Schneider on a flight to Europe during a promotional tour.[l]During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea.[12]Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his career in politics, saying about the film, ""It is a little bit about myself.""[13]On October 11, 1988,Thomas Disch(the author ofThe Brave Little Toaster) had met with Fink and Roy E. Disney to discuss the idea, and within the next month, he had written a nine-pagedtreatmententitledKing of the Kalahari.[14][15]Throughout 1989, several Disney staff writers, including Jenny Tripp, Tim Disney, Valerie West and Miguel Tejada-Flores, had written treatments for the project. Tripp's treatment, dated on March 2, 1989, introduced the name ""Simba"" for the main character, who gets separated from his pride and is adopted by Kwashi, ababoon, and Mabu, amongoose. He is later raised in a community of baboons. Simba battles an eviljackalnamed Ndogo, and reunites with his pride.[16]Later that same year, Fink recruited his friend J. T. Allen, a writer, to develop new story treatments. Fink and Allen had earlier made several trips to a Los Angeles zoo to observe the animal behavior that was to be featured in the script. Allen completed his script, which was titledThe Lion King, on January 19, 1990. However, Fink, Katzenberg, and Roy E. Disney felt Allen's script could benefit from a more experienced screenwriter, and turned toRonald Bass, who had recently won anAcademy Award for Best Original ScreenplayforRain Man(1988). At the time, Bass was preoccupied to rewrite the script himself, but agreed to supervise the revisions. The new script, credited to both Allen and Bass, was retitledKing of the Beastsand completed on May 23, 1990.[16]Sometime later,Linda Woolverton, who was also writingBeauty and the Beast(1991), spent a year writing several drafts of the script, which was titledKing of the Beastsand thenKing of the Jungle.[17]The original version of the film was vastly different from the final product. The plot centered on a battle between lions and baboons, with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being acheetah,[13]and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends.[18]Simba would not only leave the kingdom but become a ""lazy, slovenly, horrible character"" due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age.[19]By 1990, producerThomas Schumacher, who had just completedThe Rescuers Down Under(1990), decided to attach himself to the project ""because lions are cool"".[17]Schumacher likened theKing of the Junglescript to ""an animatedNational Geographicspecial"".[20]George Scribner, who had directedOliver & Company(1988), was the initial director of the film,[21]being later joined byRoger Allers, who was the lead story man onBeauty and the Beast(1991).[7][12]Allers worked with Scribner and Woolverton on the project, but temporarily left the project to help rewriteAladdin(1992). Eight months later, Allers returned to the project,[22][23]and broughtBrenda ChapmanandChris Sanderswith him.[24]In October 1991, several of the lead crew members, including Allers, Scribner, Chapman, Sanders, and Lisa Keene visitedHell's Gate National Parkin Kenya, in order to study and gain an appreciation of the environment for the film.[25][26]After six months of story development work, Scribner decided to leave the project upon clashing with Allers and the producers over their decision to turn the film into a musical, since Scribner's intention was of making a documentary-like film more focused on natural aspects.[12][21]By April 1992,Rob Minkoffhad replaced Scribner as the new co-director.[5][24]Don Hahnjoined the production as the film's producer because Schumacher was promoted to Vice President of Development for Walt Disney Feature Animation.[20][27]Hahn found the script unfocused and lacking a clear theme, and after establishing the main theme as ""leaving childhood and facing up to the realities of the world"", asked for a final retool. Allers, Minkoff, Chapman, and Hahn then rewrote the story across two weeks of meetings with directorsKirk WiseandGary Trousdale, who had finished directingBeauty and the Beast(1991).[28]One of the definite ideas that stemmed from the meetings was to have Mufasa return as aghost. Allers also changed the character Rafiki from a more serious court advisor into a wacky shaman.[29]The title was also changed fromKing of the JungletoThe Lion King, as the setting was not the jungle but the savannah.[12]It was also decided to make Mufasa and Scar brothers, as the writers felt it was much more interesting if the threat came from someone within the family.[30]Allers and Minkoff pitched the revised story to Katzenberg andMichael Eisner, to which Eisner felt the story ""could be moreShakespearean""; he suggested modeling the story onKing Lear. Maureen Donley, an associate producer, countered, stating that the story resembledHamlet.[31]Continuing on the idea, Allers recalled Katzenberg asking them to ""put in as muchHamletas you can"". However, they felt it was too forced, and looked to other heroic archetypes such as the stories ofJosephandMosesfrom theBible.[30][32]Aside from Disney's prioranthology filmsandThe Rescuers Down Under(1990) (a sequel toThe Rescuers(1977)),The Lion Kingwas Disney's first animated feature film to feature an original story conception, although the final product was heavily modelled onHamlet,JosephandMoses. The story has also been compared to Shakespeare's lesser known playsHenry IV, Part 1andPart 2.[33]By this point, Woolverton had left the production to work on theBroadway adaptationofBeauty and the Beast.[5]To replace her, Allers and Minkoff met with numerous screenwriters, includingBilly Bob ThorntonandJoss Whedon, to discuss writing the new screenplay.[31]During the summer of 1992,Irene Mecchiwas hired as the new screenwriter, and months later, she was joined byJonathan Roberts. Mecchi and Roberts took charge of the revision process, fixing unresolved emotional issues in the script and adding comedic situations for Pumbaa, Timon, and the hyenas.[34][5]LyricistTim Riceworked closely with the screenwriting team, flying to California at least once a month, as his songs for the film needed to work in the narrative continuity. Rice's lyrics—which were reworked up to the production's end—were pinned to thestoryboardsduring development.[35]Rewrites were frequent, with animatorAndreas Dejasaying that completed scenes would be delivered, only for the response to be that parts needed to be reanimated because of dialogue changes.[36]Due to the rewrites,The Lion Kingmissed its initial release window for Thanksgiving 1993, withThe Nightmare Before Christmas(1993) assuming its release slot.[37]Hahn stated the film was delayed to a summer 1994 release, ""with much consternation, because people said you can't release animation in the summertime.""[38]CastingThe voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters; for instance,James Earl Joneswas cast because the directors found his voice ""powerful"" and similar to a lion's roar.[39]Jones remarked that during the years of production, Mufasa ""became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a] grand king"".[40]Nathan Laneauditioned forZazu, andErnie Sabellafor one of the hyenas. Upon meeting at the recording studio, Lane and Sabella – who were starring together in aBroadwayproduction ofGuys and Dollsat the time – were asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to instead cast them as Timon and Pumbaa.[39][41]For the hyenas, the original intention was to reuniteCheech & Chong, but whileCheech Marinagreed to voice Banzai,Tommy Chongwas unavailable. His role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, voiced byWhoopi Goldberg, who insisted on being in the film.[18]The English double actVic Reeves and Bob Mortimerauditioned for roles as a pair of chipmunks; according to Mortimer, the producers were enthusiastic, but he and Reeves were uncomfortable with their corporate attitude and abandoned the film.[42]Rowan Atkinsonwas initially uninterested in the studio's offer to voice Zazu, later explaining that ""voice work is something I generally had never done and never liked [...] I'm a visual artist, if I'm anything, and it seemed to be a pointless thing to do"". His friend and fellowMr. Beanwriter/actorRobin Driscollconvinced him to accept the role, and Atkinson retrospectively expressed thatThe Lion Kingbecame ""a really, very special film"".[43]Matthew Broderickwas cast as adultSimbaearly during production. Broderick only recorded with another actor once over the three years he worked on the film, and only learned thatMoira KellyvoicedNalaat the film's premiere.[44]English actorsTim Curry,Malcolm McDowell,Alan Rickman,Patrick Stewart, andIan McKellenwere considered for the role ofScar,[45]which eventually went to fellow EnglishmanJeremy Irons.[46]Irons initially turned down the part, as he felt uncomfortable going to a comedic role after his dramatic portrayal ofClaus von BülowinReversal of Fortune(1990). His performance in that film inspired the writers to incorporate more of his acting as von Bülow in the script – adding one of that character's lines, ""You have no idea"" – and prompted animator Andreas Deja to watchReversal of FortuneandDamage(1992) in order to incorporate Irons' facial traits and tics.[40][47]Animation""The Lion Kingwas considered a little movie because we were going to take some risks. The pitch for the story was a lion cub gets framed for murder by his uncle set to the music ofElton John. People said, 'What? Good luck with that.' But for some reason, the people who ended up on the movie were highly passionate about it and motivated.""Don Hahn[41]The development ofThe Lion Kingcoincided with that ofPocahontas(1995), which most of the animators ofWalt Disney Feature Animationdecided to work on instead, believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.[30]The story artists also did not have much faith in the project, with Chapman declaring she was reluctant to accept the job ""because the story wasn't very good"",[48]andBurny Mattinsontelling his colleagueJoe Ranft: ""I don't know who is going to want to watch that one.""[49]Most of the leading animators either were doing their first major work supervising a character, or had much interest in animating an animal.[13]Thirteen of these supervising animators, both in California and in Florida, were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the film's main characters. The animation leads for the main characters includedMark Hennon young Simba,Ruben A. Aquinoon adult Simba,Andreas Dejaon Scar,Aaron Blaiseon young Nala,Anthony DeRosaon adult Nala, and Tony Fucile on Mufasa.[5]Nearly twenty minutes of the film, including the ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" sequence,[18]was animated at theDisney-MGM Studiosfacility. More than 600 artists, animators, and technicians contributed toThe Lion King.[21]Weeks before the film's release, the1994 Northridge earthquakeshut down the studio and required the animators to complete viaremote work.[50]The character animators studied real-life animals for reference, as was done forBambi(1942).Jim Fowler, renowned wildlife expert, visited the studios on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other savannah inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings authenticity.[51]The animators also studied animal movements at theMiami MetroZoounder guidance from wildlife expertRon Magill.[52]The Pride Lands are modeled on the Kenyan national park visited by the crew. Varied focal lengths and lenses were employed to differ from the habitual portrayal of Africa in documentaries—which employtelephoto lensesto shoot the wildlife from a distance. The epic feel drew inspiration from concept studies by artist Hans Bacher—who, following Scribner's request for realism, tried to depict effects such aslens flare—and the works of paintersCharles Marion Russell,Frederic Remington, andMaxfield Parrish.[53][54]Art director Andy Gaskill and the filmmakers sought to give the film a sense of grand sweep and epic scale similar toLawrence of Arabia(1962). Gaskill explained: ""We wanted audiences to sense the vastness of the savannah and to feel the dust and the breeze swaying through the grass. In other words, to get a real sense of nature and to feel as if they were there. It's very difficult to capture something as subtle as a sunrise or rain falling on a pond, but those are the kinds of images that we tried to get."" The filmmakers also watched the films ofJohn Fordand other filmmakers, which also influenced the design of the film.[5]Because the characters were notanthropomorphized, all the animators had to learn to draw four-legged animals, and the story and character development was done through the use of longer shots following the characters.[18]Computers helped the filmmakers present their vision in new ways. For the wildebeest stampede sequence, several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds,cel shadedto look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd.[55]Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the two-and-a-half-minute stampede.[5]TheComputer Animation Production System(CAPS) helped simulate camera movements such astracking shots, and was employed in coloring, lighting, and particle effects.[18]MusicMain article:The Lion King(1994 soundtrack)LyricistTim Rice, who was working with composerAlan Menkenon songs forAladdin(1992), was invited to write songs forThe Lion King, and accepted on the condition of bringing in a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's suggestion ofElton John,[39]after Rice's invitation ofABBAfell through due toBenny Andersson's commitments to the stage musicalKristina från Duvemåla.[13]John expressed an interest in writing ""ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and see those movies and get just as much pleasure out of them"", mentioning a possible influence ofThe Jungle Book(1967), where he felt the ""music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults"".[56]Rice and John wrote five original songs forThe Lion King(""Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"", ""Be Prepared"", ""Hakuna Matata"", and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight""), with John's performance of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" playing over the end credits.[57]TheIMAXand DVD releases added another song, ""The Morning Report"", based on a song discarded during development that eventually featured in thelive musical version ofThe Lion King.[58]The score was composed byHans Zimmer, who was hired based on his earlier work on two films in African settings,A World Apart(1988) andThe Power of One(1992),[59]and supplemented the score with traditional native African music and choir elements arranged byLebo M.[57]Zimmer said while uninterested at first due to a dislike of Broadway musicals, accepted the job to have a work he could watch with his daughter, and given he also lost his father as a child, used that as inspiration for the music regarding Mufasa's death.[60]Zimmer's partnersMark MancinaandJay Rifkinhelped with arrangements and song production.[61]Jason Weaver recorded his song vocals as young Simba for ""I Just Can't Wait to be King,"" ""Hakuna Matata,"" and an unused song, 'Warthog Rhapsody,"" the day he came in for what was supposed to be an audition.[62]His mother turned down Disney's initial financial offer and negotiated a fee of $100,000 plus royalties.[63]TheLion Kingoriginal motion picture soundtrack was released byWalt Disney Recordson April 27, 1994. It was the fourth-best-selling album of the year on theBillboard200and the top-selling soundtrack.[64]It is the only soundtrack to an animated film to becertified Diamond(10× platinum) by theRecording Industry Association of America. Zimmer's complete instrumental score for the film was never originally given a full release, until the soundtrack's commemorativetwentieth anniversary re-releasein 2014.[65]The Lion Kingalso inspired the 1995 releaseRhythm of the Pride Lands, with eight songs by Zimmer, Mancina, and Lebo M.[66]The use of the song ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" in a scene with Timon and Pumbaa led to disputes between Disney and the family of South AfricanSolomon Linda, who composed the song (originally titled ""Mbube"") in 1939. In July 2004, Linda's family filed a lawsuit, seeking $1.6 million in royalties from Disney. In February 2006, Linda's heirs reached a settlement with Abilene Music, who held the worldwide rights and had licensed the song to Disney for an undisclosed amount of money.[67]MarketingForThe Lion King's first film trailer, Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening sequence with the song ""Circle of Life"".Buena Vista Pictures DistributionpresidentDick Cooksaid the decision was made for such an approach because ""we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we've seen"", and Don Hahn added that ""Circle of Life"" worked as a trailer as it ""came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang"". The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanyingThe Three Musketeers(1993) andSister Act 2: Back in the Habit(1993) in theaters; by then, only a third ofThe Lion Kinghad been completed.[38][68]Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview.[38]Prior to the film's release, Disney did 11test screenings.[69]Upon release,The Lion Kingwas accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign which included tie-ins withBurger King,Mattel,Kodak,Nestlé, andPayless ShoeSource, and various merchandise,[70]accounting 186 licensed products.[71][72]In 1994, Disney earned approximately $1 billion with products based on the film,[73]with $214 million forLion Kingtoys during Christmas 1994 alone.[74]In a 2024 retrospective, theNew York Timesnoted that the marketing and promotion of the film heavily focused on Jonathan Taylor Thomas' role in the film, with a lot less emphasis on Jason Weaver's role as young Simba's singing voice.[63]ReleaseTheatricalThe Lion Kinghad a limited release in the United States on June 15, 1994, playing in only two theaters,El Capitan TheatreinLos AngelesandRadio City Music HallinNew York City,[75]and featuring live shows with ticket prices up to $30.[76]The wide release in the United States and Canada followed on June 24, 1994, in 2,550 screens. The digitalsurround soundof the film led many of those theaters to implementDolby Laboratories' newest sound systems.[77]The film also started its international release on June 24, opening in Latin America, South Africa and Israel.[78]LocalizationWhen first released in 1994,The Lion Kingnumbered 28 versions overall in as many languages and dialects worldwide, including a specialZuluversion made specifically for the film in South Africa, where a Disney USA team went to find the Zulu voice-actors. This was the first Zulu dubbing made by Disney, and also the only one made in any African language other thanArabic.[79][80]The Zulu language version was released in South Africa on June 24, 1994.[81][82][78]Following the success of the 2017 Māori dub ofMoana, a Māori version ofThe Lion Kingwas announced in 2021, and released theatrically on June 23, 2022, to align with the Māori holiday ofMatariki.[83][84]Much of theMatewa Mediaproduction team, including producerChelsea Winstanley, directorTweedie Waititi, and co-musical directorRob Ruhahad previously worked on the Māori language version ofMoana.[85]The Lion King Reo Māoriis the first time a language adaptation has translated Elton John's ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" for the ending credits.[86]Re-releasesIMAX and large-formatThe film was re-issued on December 25, 2002, forIMAXandlarge-formattheaters. Don Hahn explained that eight years afterThe Lion Kinghad its original release, ""there was a whole new generation of kids who haven't really seen it, particularly on the big screen."" Given the film had already been digitally archived during production, the restoration process was easier, while also providing many scenes with enhancements that covered up original deficiencies.[69][87]An enhanced sound mix was also provided to, as Hahn explained, ""make the audience feel like they're in the middle of the movie.""[69]On its first weekend,The Lion Kingmade $2.7 million from 66 locations, a $27,664 per theater average. This run ended with $15.7 million on May 30, 2003.[88]3D conversionIn 2011,The Lion Kingwas converted to3Dfor a two-week limited theatrical re-issue and subsequent 3DBlu-rayrelease.[89][90]The film opened at the number one spot on Friday, September 16, 2011, with $8.9 million[91]and finished the weekend with $30.2 million, ranking number one at the box office. This madeThe Lion Kingthe first re-issue release to earn the number-one slot at the American weekend box office since the re-issue ofReturn of the Jedi(1983) in March 1997.[92]The film also achieved the fourth-highest September opening weekend of all time.[93]It held off very well on its second weekend, again earning first place at the box office with a 27 percent decline to $21.9 million.[94]Most box-office observers had expected the film to fall about 50 percent in its second weekend and were also expectingMoneyball(2011) to be at first place.[95]After its initial box-office success, many theaters decided to continue to show the film for more than two weeks, even though its 3D Blu-ray release was scheduled for two and a half weeks after its theatrical release.[94]In North America, the 3D re-release ended its run in theaters on January 12, 2012, with a gross of $94.2 million. Outside North America, it earned $83.4 million.[96]The successful 3D re-release ofThe Lion Kingmade Disney andPixarplan 3D theatrical re-releases ofBeauty and the Beast,Finding Nemo(2003),Monsters, Inc.(2001), andThe Little Mermaid(1989) during 2012 and 2013.[97]However, none of the re-releases of the first three films achieved the enormous success ofThe Lion King 3Dand the theatrical re-release ofThe Little Mermaidwas ultimately cancelled.[98]In 2012, Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo wrote that the reason why the 3D version ofThe Lion Kingsucceeded was because, ""the notion of a 3D re-release was still fresh and exciting, andThe Lion King (3D)felt timely given the movie's imminent Blu-ray release. Audiences have been hit with three 3D re-releases in the year since, meaning the novelty value has definitely worn off.""[99]Disney 100As part of Disney's 100th anniversary,The Lion Kingwas re-released between September 29 to October 12, 2023, in selectedCinemarktheaters across the United States as well asHeliostheaters across Poland on October 8.[100][101]30th anniversaryIn conjunction with the film's 30th anniversary,The Lion Kingwas re-released on July 12, 2024.[102]During its opening weekend, the film earned an estimated $1.08 million in the United States from 1,330 theaters.[103]Home mediaThe Lion Kingwas first released onVHSandLaserDiscin the United States on March 3, 1995, underDisney's ""Masterpiece Collection"" video series. The VHS edition of this release contained a special preview forWalt Disney Pictures' then-upcominganimatedfeature filmPocahontas(1995), in which thetitle character(voiced byJudy Kuhn) sings the musical number ""Colors of the Wind"".[104]In addition, Deluxe Editions of both formats were released. The VHS Deluxe Edition included the film, an exclusivelithographof Rafiki and Simba (in some editions), a commemorative ""Circle of Life""epigraph, six concept art lithographs, another tape with the half-hour TV specialThe Making of The Lion King, and a certificate of authenticity. The CAV laserdisc Deluxe Edition also contained the film, six concept art lithographs andThe Making of The Lion King, and added storyboards, character design artwork, concept art, rough animation, and a directors' commentary that the VHS edition did not have, on a total of four double sided discs. The VHS tape quickly became thebest-selling videotapeof all time: 4.5 million tapes were sold on the first day[105]and ultimately sales totaled more than 30 million[106]before these home video versions went intomoratoriumin 1997.[107]The VHS releases have sold a total of 32million units in North America,[108]and grossed$520 millionin sales revenue.[109]In addition, 23million units were shipped overseas to international markets.[110]In the Philippines, the film was released on VHS in March 1995 by Magnavision.[111]The film sold more than55 millionvideo copies worldwide by August 1997, making it the best-sellinghome videotitle of all time.[112]On October 7, 2003, the film was re-released on VHS and released onDVDfor the first time, titledThe Lion King: Platinum Edition, as part of Disney's Platinum Edition line of DVDs. The DVD release featured two versions of the film on the first disc, a remastered version created for the 2002IMAXrelease and an edited version of the IMAX release purporting to be the original 1994 theatrical version.[113]A second disc, with bonus features, was also included in the DVD release. The film's soundtrack was provided both in its originalDolby 5.1track and in a new Disney Enhanced Home Theater Mix, making this one of the first Disney DVDs so equipped.[114]ThisTHXcertified two-disc DVD release also contains several games,Timon and Pumbaa's Virtual Safari, deleted scenes, music videos and other bonus features.[115]By means ofseamless branching, the film could be viewed either with or without a newly created scene – a short conversation in the film replaced with a complete song (""The Morning Report"").

The website's critical consensus reads, ""Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully animated,The Lion Kingstands tall within Disney's pantheon of classic family films.""[151]It also ranked 56th on Rotten Tomatoes' ""Top 100 Animation Movies"".[152]AtMetacritic, which uses aweighted average, the film received a score of 88 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[153]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film a rare ""A+"" grade on an A+ to F scale.[154]Roger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film three and a half stars out of a possible four and called it ""a superbly drawn animated feature"". He further wrote in his print review, ""The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly toHamlet, is a learning experience as well as an entertainment.""[4]On the television programSiskel & Ebert, the film was praised but received a mixed reaction when compared to the previous Disney films. Ebert and his partnerGene Siskelboth gave the film a ""Thumbs Up"", but Siskel said that it was not as good asBeauty and the Beastand that it was ""a good film, not a great one"".[155]Hal Hinson ofThe Washington Postcalled it ""an impressive, almost daunting achievement"" and felt that the film was ""spectacular in a manner that has nearly become commonplace with Disney's feature-length animations"". However, he was less enthusiastic toward the end of his review saying, ""Shakespearean in tone, epic in scope, it seems more appropriate for grown-ups than for kids. If truth be told, even for adults it is downright strange.""[156]Owen GleibermanofEntertainment Weeklypraised the film, writing that it ""has the resonance to stand not just as a terrific cartoon but as an emotionally pungent movie"".[157]Rolling Stonefilm criticPeter Traverspraised the film and felt that it was ""a hugely entertaining blend of music, fun, and eye-popping thrills, though it doesn't lack for heart"".[158]James BerardinellifromReelviews.netpraised the film saying, ""With each new animated release, Disney seems to be expanding its already-broad horizons a little more.The Lion Kingis the most mature (in more than one sense) of these films, and there clearly has been a conscious effort to please adults as much as children. Happily, for those of us who generally stay far away from 'cartoons', they have succeeded.""[159]Steve Pond ofThe Washington Postreported thatThe Lion Kingfailed to replicate the near-unanimous acclaim achieved by some of its predecessors.[160]Some reviewers still had problems with the film's narrative.Kenneth Turanof theLos Angeles Timesfelt the film ""is less of a piece than its revered predecessors and the first to have a core story noticeably less involving than its scintillating peripheral characters.""[161]TV Guidewrote that whileThe Lion Kingwas technically proficient and entertaining, it ""offers a less memorable song score than did the previous hits, and a hasty, unsatisfying dramatic resolution.""[162]The New Yorker's Terrence Rafferty considered that despite the good animation, the story felt like ""manipulat[ing] our responses at will"", as ""Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers and silly, rambunctious comedy"".[163]AccoladesList of awards and nominationsAwardCategoryNominee(s)ResultRef.Academy AwardsBest Original ScoreHans ZimmerWon[164]Best Original Song""Can You Feel the Love Tonight""Music byElton John;Lyrics byTim RiceWon""Circle of Life""Music by Elton John;Lyrics by Tim RiceNominated""Hakuna Matata""Music by Elton John;Lyrics by Tim RiceNominatedAmerican Music AwardsTop SoundtrackThe Lion King: Original Motion Picture SoundtrackWon[165]Annie AwardsBest Animated FeatureWon[166]Best Achievement in Story ContributionBrenda Chapman(Head of Story)WonBest Achievement in Production DesignMark Henn(Supervising Animator for ""Young Simba"")NominatedScott F.

Animator Tom Sito has stated that the letters spell ""SFX"" (a common abbreviation for ""special effects""), not with an ""E"" instead of the ""F"", and were intended as an innocent ""signature"" created by the effects animation team.[216]Hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal, though the complaints may have been somewhattongue-in-cheek. One hyena researcher, who had organized the animators' visit to theUniversity of California, Berkeley, Field Station for the Study of Behavior, Ecology, and Reproduction, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas,[217]listed ""boycottThe Lion King""in an article listing ways to help preserve hyenas in the wild, and later ""joke[d] thatThe Lion Kingset back hyena conservation efforts.""[218][219]Even so, the film was also credited with ""spark[ing] an interest"" in hyenas at the Berkeley center.[219]The film has been criticized for race and class issues, with the hyenas seen as reflecting negative stereotypes ofblackandLatinoethnic communities.[220][221][222]Others have also criticized the film for advancing afascistnarrative in its portrayal of a lion kingdom and a circle of life where ""only the strong and the beautiful triumph, and the powerless survive only by serving the strong.""[223][224]Resemblance toKimba the White LionFurther information:Claims of resemblance toThe Lion KingScreenshot from an early presentation reel ofThe Lion Kingthat shows awhite lioncub and a butterfly.Elements ofThe Lion Kingresemble the 1960s Japaneseanimetelevision seriesJungle Emperor(known asKimba the White Lionin the United States). The 1994 release ofThe Lion Kingdrew a protest in Japan, whereKimbaand its creator,Osamu Tezuka, are cultural icons. 488 Japanese cartoonists and animators, led by themangaauthorMachiko Satonaka, signed a petition accusing Disney of plagiarism and demanding that they give due credit to Tezuka.[225][226]Broderick believed initially that he was working on an American version ofKimba.[227]Allers said he was unfamiliar withKimbauntilThe Lion Kingwas almost complete, and did not remember it being mentioned during development.[22]The law professorMadhavi Sundersuggested that Allers might have seen the 1989 remake ofKimbaon television while living in Tokyo. However, while Allers did move to Tokyo in 1983 to work onLittle Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland(1989), he moved back to the United States in 1985, four years before the 1989 remake ofKimbabegan airing.[5][228]Minkoff also said he was unfamiliar withKimba,[229][230]and observed that stories set in Africa often have characters such as baboons, birds and hyenas.[229]Takayuki Matsutani, the president ofTezuka Productions, which createdKimba the White Lion, said in 1994 that ""quite a few staff of our company saw a preview ofThe Lion King, discussed this subject and came to the conclusion that you cannot avoid having these similarities as long as you use animals as characters and try to draw images out of them"".[231]Yoshihiro Shimizu of Tezuka Productions refuted rumors that the studio was paidhush moneyby Disney and said they had no interest in suing Disney, explaining that ""we think it's a totally different story"". Shimizu said that they rejected urges from some American lawyers to sue because ""we're a small, weak company... Disney's lawyers are among the top twenty in the world!""[232]Tezuka's family and Tezuka Productions never pursued litigation.[233]The American writerFred Ladd, who was involved with importingKimbaand other Japanese anime into America forNBC, expressed incredulity that Disney staff could be ignorant ofKimba.[234][230]Ladd said at least one animator was remembered by his colleagues as aKimbafan and vociferous about Disney's conduct during production.[234]The animatorsTom Sitoand Mark Kausler said they had watchedKimbaas children in the 1960s, but Sito denied any influence, and Kausler emphasized Disney'sBambias their model.[235][231]The controversy was parodied inThe Simpsonsepisode ""'Round Springfield"", in which Mufasa appears through the clouds and says, ""You must avenge my death, Kimba... I mean, Simba.""[236]LegacySequels and spin-offsMain article:The Lion King(franchise)The firstLion King–related animated project was the spin-off television series,The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa, which centers on the characters of Timon and Pumbaa, as they have their own (mis)adventures both within' and outside of the Serengeti.

Set in 1944 inNormandy, France, duringWorld War II, it follows a group of soldiers, led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), on a mission to locate Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him home safely after his three brothers have been killed in action. The cast also includesEdward Burns,Tom SizemoreandJeremy Davies.Inspired by the books ofStephen E. Ambroseand accounts of multiple soldiers in a single family, such as theNiland brothers, being killed in action, Rodat drafted the script, andParamount Pictureshired him to finish writing it. The project came to the attention of Hanks and Spielberg, whose involvement, due to their previous successes, secured the project's development. Spielberg wanted to makeSaving Private Ryanas authentic as possible and hiredFrank DarabontandScott Frankto do uncredited rewrites based on research and interviews with veterans. The main cast went through a week-long boot camp to help them understand the soldier's experience. Filming took place from June to September 1997, on a $65–70million budget, almost entirely on location in England and Ireland. The openingOmaha Beachbattle was the most demanding scene, costing $12 million to film over a four-week period, and using 1,500 background actors.Saving Private Ryanbecame one of the year's most successful films, earning critical acclaim for its graphic portrayal of combat. WWII veterans described the combat scenes as the most realistic portrayal of their own experiences they had seen; some said they had been unable to watch it due to their traumatic memories. The film earned $481.8million, making it thesecond-highest-grossing film of 1998, and went on to win many accolades, includingGolden Globe,Academy,BAFTA, andSaturnawards.Consideredone of the greatest war films ever made,Saving Private Ryan's battle-scene filming techniques impacted many subsequent war, action, and superhero films, and numerous directors have citedSaving Private Ryanas an influence on them. The picture is credited with having helped to renew interest in WWII at the turn of the century, inspiring other films, television shows, and video gamesset during the war. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressas ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".Plot[edit]On June 6, 1944, theU.S. Armylands atOmaha Beachas part of theNormandy invasion, incurring major losses against the artillery and machine gun fire of the heavily fortifiedGerman forces. Initially dazed by the chaotic battle,2nd Ranger BattalionCaptainJohn H. Miller takes command of a surviving group and leads a successful infiltration behind German lines to secure victory.TheUnited States Department of Warreceives communication that three of four Ryan brothers have been killed in action; the last, James Francis Ryan of the101st Airborne Division, is listed as missing.GeneralGeorge C. Marshallorders that Ryan be found and sent home, to spare his family the loss of all its sons. Miller is tasked with recovering Ryan and assembles a detachment of soldiers to accompany him: Mike Horvath, Richard Reiben, Adrian Caparzo, Stanley Mellish, Daniel Jackson, medic Irwin Wade, and interpreter Timothy Upham, who lacks any combat experience.The group tracks Ryan to the town ofNeuville-au-Plain, where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper while trying to rescue a young girl. Mourning their friend, the men grow resentful at being forced to risk their lives for one man. They later find James Frederick Ryan, but realize he is the wrong man with a similar name. That evening, the men rest in a chapel, where Miller tells Horvath that his hands began uncontrollably shaking after he joined the war. The men travel to a rallying point where the 101st Airborne might be after landing off course, where they find scores of wounded and displaced soldiers. Wade admonishes Reiben, Mellish, and Jackson for callously searching through a pile of deceased soldiers'dog tagsin front of passing troops, hoping to find Ryan's among them and conclude their mission. Remorseful for ignoring their behavior, Miller shouts for anyone who knows Ryan; one deafened soldier tells him that Ryan was reassigned to defend a vital bridge in the town of Ramelle.On the way, Miller decides to neutralize a German gun nest they discover, against the advice of his men, and although they are successful, Wade is killed. The men prepare to execute a surrendered German soldier in revenge, but Upham intervenes, arguing that they should follow therules of war. Miller releases the soldier, nicknamed ""Steamboat Willie"", ordering that he surrender to the nextAlliedpatrol. Discontented with the mission, Reiben threatens todesert, leading to a standoff between the men that Miller defuses by revealing his civilian background as a teacher and baseball coach, which he had always refused to disclose. Miller muses that people often guessed his career before he became a soldier, while his men could not, implying that war has changed him, and worries whether he is still the man he was and whether his wife will recognize him.In Ramelle, Miller's detachment finds Ryan and informs him of their mission, but Ryan refuses to abandon his post or his fellow soldiers, believing he does not deserve to go home more than anyone else. Horvath convinces Miller that saving Ryan might be the only truly decent thing they can accomplish during the war. Miller takes command of Ryan's group as the only officer present and prepares the soldiers for a German assault. Jackson and Horvath are killed, and Upham stands paralyzed with fear as Mellish is stabbed to death. Steamboat Willie returns and shoots Miller before reinforcements arrive to defeat the Germans. Upham confronts Willie, who attempts to surrender again, and kills him, before sending the other surrendering Germans away. Upham and Reiben observe as the mortally wounded Miller tells Ryan to earn the sacrifices made to send him home.Decades later, an elderly Ryan and his family visit Miller's grave at theNormandy Cemetery. Ryan expresses that he remembers Miller's words every day, lived his life the best he could, and hopes he has earned their sacrifices.Cast[edit](Top, left to right)Tom Hanks(pictured in 2019),Edward Burns(2010), andTom Sizemore(2011); (Bottom)Vin Diesel(2013),Barry Pepper(2009), andGiovanni Ribisi(2009)Tom Hanksas John H.

The pair met in early 1995 to discuss potential projects and ideas. Within a few weeks, Rodat conceived ofSaving Private Ryan.[10][11]He was inspired by a gift from his wife, the historical bookD-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II(1994), byStephen E. Ambrose, recounting the events of the Normandy landings. Rodat visited a monument inKeene, New Hampshirededicated to American soldiers killed in combat; he noticed the losses included brothers. He said, ""The idea of losing a son to war is painful beyond description... the idea of losing more than one son is inconceivable"".[10][11][12]The Ryan family was based on the fourNiland brothersdetailed in Ambrose's book, who were deployed during WWII; two were killed and a third presumed dead; per theSole Survivor Policy, the fourth was returned from the war.[10][13][14]Development[edit]To developSaving Private Ryan, Gordon founded the independent film studioMutual Film Company, alongside producerGary Levinsohn.[10]Gordon brought Rodat's draft toParamount Picturesexecutives; they responded positively and hired Rodat who wrote the script over the following 12 months.[10][11][15]Michael Baywas hired as director, but left the project because he could not resolve how to approach the material.[16][17]Carin Sage, a junior agent representing Tom Hanks at theCreative Artists Agency, gave the script to Hanks, who was immediately interested and met with Gordon and Levinsohn.[10][11][15]Hanks shared the script withSteven Spielbergwho agreed to direct because the pair had wanted to work together for some time.[10][15]Rodat thought that Paramount would cancel the project after the studio purchased two other WWII-era scripts,CombatandWith Wings as Eagles, with popular actorsBruce WillisandArnold Schwarzeneggerattached, respectively.[10]However, having secured the involvement of Hanks and Spielberg, two of the highest-paid and most successful actors and directors, Gordon suggested Paramount executives prioritizeSaving Private Ryan.[10]Describing what interested him about the project, Spielberg said, ""So what you're doing is sending eight people out, all of whom have parents, to rescue one boy and send him back to his mom when any or all of these kids, along the mission route, could be killed. That was the central tug that made me want to tell the story"".[18]Spielberg had a lifelong interest in WWII, having made war films as a teenager because ""it was the seminal conversation inside my family. My parents talked aboutthe Holocaustand they talked about combat and war. And I was born knowing this.My dadwas a veteran... he had many veterans over to the house, and I became absolutely obsessed... based on my father's stories, recollections, and also based on all the WWII movies"".[14][19][20]He described the project as a tribute to his father.[21]With Spielberg on board,DreamWorks Pictures, which he co-founded, became involved as a financier, with his companyAmblin Entertainmentas a production company.[11][22][23]Spielberg's clout effectively removed Gordon and Levinsohn from the production, having no creative input, equity, or rights, but receiving a producer's credit and one-off payment. Levinsohn said, ""You just know going in what the score is... I guess it's unspoken that when you hire Steven Spielberg you're not going to be on the set making decisions"".[10]DreamWorks hiredIan Bryceto replace them. In April 1997,Sumner Redstone, chairman of Paramount's parent companyViacom, had Spielberg flip a coin to determine the film's distribution rights. Spielberg won the toss, giving DreamWorks the favored North American distribution rights and Paramount the international rights. Earnings were held collectively and split evenly between the studios. In exchange, Paramount received the North American distribution rights to DreamWorks'Deep Impact(1998).[a]To keep the budget low, Spielberg and Hanks took minimal upfront salaries in exchange for a guaranteed 17.5% of the gross profits, equivalent to 35 cents of every dollar earned.[10][15]Rewrite[edit]TheNiland brothers(1940s) were an influence onSaving Private Ryan'splotSpielberg's initial concept forSaving Private Ryanwas aBoys' Own–style adventure film in which the search for Ryan was apublic relationseffort by the war department. However, after interviewing WWII veterans for research, he found this idea inappropriate. He decided to embed the story within a realistic portrayal of actual events while portraying the conflicted morality of sending men into life-threatening situations to save one man.[b]He said, ""I cannot tell you how many veterans came up to me... and said: 'Please be honest about it. Please don't make another Hollywood movie about WWII. Please tell our stories...'"" The surviving Niland family was interviewed, and the story was further influenced by other substantial family war losses, including the fiveSullivan brotherskilled during WWII, and the Bixby brothers during theAmerican Civil War; theresulting letterbyAbraham Lincolnis quoted in the film.[14]Spielberg described existing WWII films as ""sanitized"" and sentimentalized, focused on depicting honor and the glory of service in a manner that was ""very safe and wholly untrue"".[c]He wanted to present the courage of the soldiers in the face of ""palpable terror, almost blind terror"":[25]I remember one of the [veterans] telling me the entire charge up the beach was a blur—not a blur to his memory because he still remembered every single grain of sand when he had his face buried in it from that fusillade raining down on them from above. But he described how everything was not in focus for him. He described the sounds, and he described the vibrations of every concussion of every88 shellthat hit the beach, which gave some of them bloody noses, rattled their ears. The ground would come up and slam into their faces from the concussions.""[19][27]Ambrose served as a historical consultant. He disliked glorified depictions of the Normandy landings that ignored the reality of soldiers slowly dying in mud and water, wanting ""their mothers, they wanted morphine. It took a long time.""[10][28][29]Spielberg believed the legacy of theVietnam Warhad made his generation less interested in glorifying combat in film. Even so, he was influenced by early war films such asBattleground(1949),The Steel Helmet(1951), andHell Is for Heroes(1962).[20]Although Rodat's script came close to the ideal WWII project he had hoped for, Spielberg said it had ""a few problems"".[30]He hiredFrank DarabontandScott Frankto performuncredited script rewrites.[d]The scene begins as the second wave of soldiers arrives on Omaha beach (Darabont's suggestion),[26]so they would be walking into ""Hell on Earth"" instead of empty beaches.[34]Scott Frank performed rewrites based on transcriptions of Spielberg's recorded ideas and two folders of historical facts about the Normandy landings; these gave Frank ideas but he found it difficult to parse the reality of events into original ideas.[35]The Normandy cemetery scene was based on Spielberg's own experience visiting the area as a youth; he witnessed a family accompanying a man who fell to his knees and began to cry at a grave marker.[14]Casting[edit]Matt Damon(pictured in 2014) andAdam Goldberg(2015)Spielberg wanted older actors for his main cast, claiming that young soldiers would look older than their age under the stresses of war.[18]Miller is the ""adult in the story,"" intended to project a calmness and feeling of safety that is undermined by the character's uncontrollable handshaking.[19]Spielberg wanted Hanks to play Miller because he was the only actor he thought of who would not ""want to use his teeth to pull out a pin from a hand grenade"".[18]Hanks formed Miller's character based on the history of the 2nd Ranger Battalion before Omaha Beach, saying he believed Miller was ""horribly afraid"" of getting more of his men killed.[19]Mel GibsonandHarrison Fordwere considered for the role.[36]Miller's detachment is a diverse group, including a Jew and Italian, reminiscent of earlier WWII films; this was not a deliberate choice, although Spielberg believed he had subconsciously drawn on conventional WWII films.[37]Burns described Reiben as a ""wise guy"" in the script, but the experience of filming the Omaha Beach landing inspired him to give the character a ""much harder edge"".[25]Sizemore was cast inThe Thin Red Line(1998) when Spielberg offered him an alternative role as Horvath, Miller's friend, and confidant.[19][37]The actor had a history of drug addiction, and Spielberg mandated that he pass regular drug tests to keep his part, or the role would be recast and his scenes re-shot.[38][13]Describing his character, Sizemore said, ""he was a quiet man; he was taciturn; he followed orders, and he loved the captain... if he had a tragic flaw, it was that he didn't know when he had had enough, when it was time to say, 'I can't do this anymore.'""[39]Diesel was cast after Spielberg saw his self-starring directorial efforts,Multi-Facial(1995) andStrays(1997). The actor was working as a telemarketer at the time, having struggled to secure acting jobs.[19]Goldberg's role did not exist in the script until his casting.[19]Spielberg wanted a relatively unknown actor to portray Private Ryan. Spielberg visited the set ofGood Will Hunting(1997), andRobin Williamsintroduced him to Damon. Spielberg cast him shortly after, believing he possessed a ""great American everyboy look,"" unaware thatGood Will Hunting's success would significantly raise Damon's profile.[e]Neil Patrick Harriswas considered for the role, andEdward Nortonturned it down forAmerican History X(1998).[36][40][41]Pete Postlethwaite,Tony Shalhoub, andGarth Brookswere considered for unspecified roles.[42][43][44]At Hanks's and Dye's suggestion, Spielberg had the principal cast take part in a six-dayboot camp, wanting them to experience cold, wet, and exhaustive conditions, like those of  WWII soldiers.[f]Overseen by Dye and retired U.S. Marines, the actors remained in character while simulating attacks, performing 5-mile (8 km) runs with full backpacks, weapons training, military exercises, and push-ups after making mistakes, on three hours of sleep per night in cold and rainy conditions.[12][13][18]The men wanted to quit, but Hanks convinced them otherwise, saying they would regret not following through and the experience would help them understand their characters and motivations.[25][28]Diesel said, ""at that moment we got this huge respect for him in real life, we were all exhausted, we all wanted to leave and here was this guy who was a superstar, who doesn't have to be here, voting to stay"".[34]Dye was present throughout filming to remind the actors of their training.[25]Spielberg kept Damon out of the boot camp because he wanted the other actors to resent him and his character.[5][6]Pre-production[edit]The pre-production forSaving Private Ryanwas truncated because Spielberg chose to filmAmistad(1997) immediately after finishing work onThe Lost World: Jurassic Park(1997). CinematographerJanusz Kamińskispent several weeks performing camera tests to define the film's visual aesthetic. The pair considered filmingmonochromaticallyas Spielberg had with his Holocaust film,Schindler's List(1993). However, they considered that this would seem ""pretentious,"" and were interested in emulating the colored WWII footage from their research. Kamiński let his interpretation of the narrative dictate how to light scenes and narrowed down visual styles by identifying which films he did not wantSaving Private Ryanto emulate.[12]He and Spielberg were visually influenced by WWII documentaries, such asMemphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress(1944),The Battle of Midway(1942),Why We Fight(1942–1945), and theNazi propagandafilms ofLeni Riefenstahl. They also looked at various books, paintings, and photographs of the Omaha Beach invasion taken by the war photographerRobert Capa.[20]Kamiński wanted it to look like a major production ""shot on [16 mm film] by a bunch of combat cameramen"".[12]A variety of camera techniques were used to emulate the experience of being on a battlefield: Kamiński removed the protective coating on some lenses, creating a ""flatter"", degraded image akin to WWII-era cameras, and mismatched lenses when using multiple cameras for an inconsistent result; alternatingshutter anglesand speeds; and desynchronizing the camera shutter which created a ""streaking"" effect. Kamiński considered this a risky option because if it failed there was no way to fix the image in post-production.[20][12][27]AClairmont Camera Image Shakervibrated the camera to emulate the effects of a nearby explosion or rolling tank.[12]Spielberg chose to film in1.85:1 aspect ratiobecause he believed it was more lifelike and closer to ""the way the human eye really sees,"" and foundwidescreen formatsto be artificial.[20]Three months were spent scouting for a location to portray the Normandy coast. The real location was too developed for their needs, and many other French beaches were restricted by military or wildlife use; Spielberg believed officials were difficult because they did not want him filming there.[12][13][25]Beaches researched in England and Scotland lacked either the aesthetics or amenities required, such as housing for the crew, and the filmmakers needed a specific depth for the cast to leap from the landing crafts into the water.[25]Associate producer, Kevin De La Noy's earlier work onBraveheart(1995) in Ireland had developed contacts with the Irish Army and knowledge of local beaches. One such location, the 11 km (6.8 miles) long Curracloe Beach, nearCurracloe, County Wexford, offered the desired golden sands and sheer cliffs and nearby amenities.[g]Spielberg selected a 1 km (0.62 miles) segment of the beach, known as Ballinesker.[46][45][47]He said, ""I was a bit disappointed that the beach we used wasn't as broad as the real Omaha Beach... I tried to use certain wide-angle lenses to extend the length of the flats on the sandy beach before the soldiers reach the shingle. I used wider lenses for geography and tighter lenses for the compression of action.""[20]A segment adjacent toBlackwater, also in Wexford, was considered, but the local nuns could not make the land available in time.[45]Service roads were built for vehicles to reach Ballinesker.[45][47]Production designerThomas E. Sandersled construction of the concrete battlements, bunkers,Czech hedgehogs, and barbed wire, much of which was made by local metalworkers.[45][47][12]Over eleven weeks were spent preparing Ballinesker for filming.[47]A storm destroyed some of the props just before filming, but they were rebuilt overnight.[25]The main crew arrived on location on June 25, 1997.[45]Filming in Ireland[edit]Ballinesker Beach (pictured in 2015), a segment of Curracloe strand in Ireland, was used to portrayOmaha BeachPrincipal photographybegan on June 27, 1997.[48][49]Filming completed up to 50 shots per day. Spielberg wanted the actors to get little rest, ""A war is fought fast, and I really wanted to keep all of the actors off-balance. I didn't want them to be able to read 75 pages of a novel... I wanted to work fast enough so that they always felt as if they were in combat... I had to keep them on the set, which meant shooting the film even faster than I normally do. War doesn't give you a break.""[14][20]Saving Private Ryanwas shot almost entirely in continuity order, although some of the crew found this ""a mentally demoralizing experience"" because the cast started together and left as their characters died.[18][14][20]The Omaha Beach battle was filmed over three to four weeks, for $12million.[h]The scene involved about 1,500 people including 400 crew, 1,000 volunteerreserveandIrish armysoldiers, and dozens of extras and about 30 amputees and paraplegics fitted with prosthetic limbs to portray disfigured soldiers.[i]Their numbers were supplemented with over one thousand detailed mannequins.[47]The extras were divided into platoons with a designated leader, allowing Dye to control their action via four different radios with aid from threenon-commissioned officers.[25]Costume designerJoanna Johnstoncontracted an American company responsible for making boots for soldiers during WWII to create about 2,000 pairs, using the last batch of dye from that period.[25][12]Soldiers in the ocean wore wet suits beneath their uniforms to minimize hypothermia.[47][46]ArmorerSimon Atherton was responsible for supplying authentic weapons.[12]TwoHiggins Boatsused in the landings were used in the scene; additional boats from the 1950s were brought from California, Donegal, and Southampton.[12][47]Hanks recalled:The first day of shooting... I was in the back of the landing craft, and that ramp went down and I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was. The air literally went pink and the noise was deafening and there's bits and pieces of stuff falling all on top of you and it was horrifying.""[28]Soldiers vomiting from the boats was achieved usingmilk of magnesia.[36]Acrane shotmoving from beneath the ocean surface to above the battlefield was achieved by placing the crane on a flatbed trailer and reversing it into the sea.[47]The Omaha Beach sequence was extensively choreographed by stunt coordinatorSimon Crane, withsquibsand explosives managed byNeil Corbould. The only serious accident resulted when an extra's foot was run over by a car.[12][25]Thousands of gallons of fake blood were used, mainly to turn the ocean and shoreline red.[47][38]Based on his interviews with veterans, Spielberg had dead fish strewn in the water and around the battlefield, as well as floating a Bible on the surface.[25]Bullet impacts were emulated using air pipes concealed beneath the sand and ocean surface.[46]Drums of diesel fuel were burned to create black smoke, while a series of pickup trucks carried systems to disperse white smoke.[12]During filming, the weather was cold, rainy, and overcast; Kamiński said this matched the weather during the Normandy landings, enhancing the film's accuracy.[20][12]Artificial light was used sparingly apart from on the boats to highlight the actors' eyes under their helmets.[12]Spielberg had the camera stay close to the ground to appear as if it was the view of a soldier avoiding getting shot or a combat cameraman. He intended for the audience to feel like they were a part of the battle rather than watching.[14][18]Most ofSaving Private Ryanwas filmed with handheld cameras. This was physically demanding on camera operator Mitch Dubin andSteadicamoperator Chris Haarhoff due to both proximity to the ground and movement through exploding scenery. The camera was close enough that fake blood, water, and sand would stick to the camera lens, but the filmmakers believed this made the footage more authentic.[12][20]Kamiński considered the extensive setup of explosives, smoke, and choreography of over a thousand characters to be demanding as it could take half a day to reset if something went wrong, but the majority of scenes in the sequence were captured in less than four takes, using up to three cameras simultaneously. Spielberg said, ""I rarely walked away from a scene until I got what I wanted, and I'd say that I got what I wanted from those complex setups about 80 percent of the time.""[12][20]He reviewed each day's footage nightly in a local parish hall.[7][47]The production crew remained after filming to restore the beach to its original state over the following month, per an ecological protection order.[45][47][12]Filming in England and France[edit]The opening and closing scenes of the film are set in theNormandy American Cemetery and MemorialnearOmaha Beach.Filming relocated to theHatfield Aerodromein Hertfordshire, England, at the end of August, for the remaining scenes and the battle of Ramelle.[j]French towns and rivers were scouted where a partial set could be built, but this was discarded over environmental concerns of filming contaminating the water. Instead, Sanders and his team built the fictional Ramelle on the grounds of the Aerodrome, based on five towns where fighting took place. Nearly threecity blockslong, the set included fully built buildings, facades, and a custom built, 900 ft (270 m) long river. The river was lined because they ""had to control the height of the water very carefully"". Explosives were used to create bomb craters and damage around Ramelle.[k]Though the battle involved fewer extras than the Omaha Beach scene, several weeks were spent developing the complex choreography based on a battle plan devised by Dye.[25]Spielberg did notstoryboardSaving Private Ryanbecause he wanted to position the camera spontaneously in reaction to what was taking place in each scene and he often relied on Dye and other WWII consultants for advice on staging the combat scenes.[52][20]Dale also advised on technical aspects of weapons; where Spielberg wanted to use larger explosions typically found in Hollywood action films, Dye would generally advise him to ""go half that size, they were never that big"".[20]The production was estimated to have spent about £8million in the local area.[50]Spielberg's spontaneous approach carried into other aspects; about halfway through filming, he decided to depict the remainder of the film from Upham's perspective, believing he represented the audience's inexperience of war.[19]Goldberg's character was only going to be shot dead until Dye suggested a hand-to-hand combat sequence on the day of filming, leading Mellish to be stabbed through the heart.[19]A separate scene of Ryan talking about his brothers was ad-libbed by Damon.[36]The German machine-gun nest and following ambush of a half-track vehicle were filmed on the grounds ofThame Park, Thame, inOxfordshire; the chapel interior where Miller's men rest was filmed in the Thame Park chapel.[53]The Iowa cornfields where Ryan's mother lives in a house built for filming was set nearWest Kennet, Wiltshire.[54]The American war office was filmed in the Hatfield Aerodrome. Kamiński wanted scenes in America to be more colorful and a relief from the muted tones of the combat scenes, so he positioned very bright lighting outside the windows.[12][50][7]Scenes featuring the elderly Ryan were filmed at theNormandy American Cemetery and MemorialinColleville-sur-Mer, France, adjacent to Omaha Beach.[55]Filming concluded ahead of schedule on September 13, 1997, after 12 weeks, with the French church interior scenes.[l]The estimated total budget was $65–$70million.[m][ii]Post-production[edit]Kamiński chose to render his footage usingTechnicolor's proprietary ENR process (similar to ableach bypass) which retained more silver in thefilm stockand produced deeper blacks. He used ""70 percent ENR"" for a desaturated image which added a blue hue. Concerned this change would make the fake blood appear inauthentic, the effects department mixed blue coloring into it, giving it a dark red appearance.[12]Visual-effects studioIndustrial Light & Magicprovided digital enhancements; many bullet wounds and blood splatter werecomputer-generated imagery.[26]Michael Kahnedited the final 170-minute cut.[n]Spielberg said that Kahn's style was intended to defy audience expectations and not make every scene or transition clear.[20]Some scenes were cut because of their graphic imagery, such as Miller's unit encounter with burnt out tanks with charred bodies. Mellish's death was also trimmed, removing parts where the character screams in pain, after Spielberg's projectionist said ""It's too painful to watch.""[19][26]Spielberg said his movie had to be ""ugly"", but was worried the violent content could be seen as exploitative and earn it a restrictiveNC-17rating from theMotion Picture Association of America, restricting it to audiences over 17 years of age.[27]He anticipated that the ""historical importance"" of the content would be taken into consideration; it received anR rating, meaning children could watch when accompanied by an adult.[15][27]Music[edit]Main article:Saving Private Ryan (soundtrack)John Williams, Spielberg's longtime collaborator, produced, composed and conducted the score.[59][60]Spielberg chose little music accompaniment, wanting the sounds of battle and death to be prominent. Using aspottingprocess, he and Williams watched a rough cut of the film to agree on which scenes would feature music.[60][61]Williams deliberately avoided ""anything grandiose or operatic"".[60]Williams recorded the 55-minute score over three days atSymphony Hallin Boston, with theBoston Symphony Orchestraand vocals by theTanglewood Festival Chorus.[61][60][62]The recording cost about $100,000 per hour.[60]Spielberg chose the Orchestra: ""This is a movie about a company of soldiers, and it seemed appropriate to use an experienced company of musicians who are all virtuosos. Also we really wanted the sound of this room, Symphony Hall. On a soundstage you can get acoustically correct sound, but you don't hear the air. Here you get a rich, warm sound off the walls and ceiling, and you do hear the air; Symphony Hall is an instrument too.""[60]Release[edit]Context[edit]See also:1998 in filmThe 1998 summer theatrical season began in early May withDeep Impact, a surprise box office hit that studios saw as a positive indicator for their upcoming 100 film releases.[63][64]GodzillaandArmageddonwere expected to be the biggest successes, while industry executives were hopeful for smaller budget films (costing less than $60million) likeSmall Soldiers,The Negotiator,The Parent Trap, andThere's Something About Maryto become sleeper hits. Fewer sequels and less escapist entertainment were scheduled for release, and more films were targeted toward older audiences.[64][63][10]Saving Private Ryanwas highly anticipated but analysis suggested the film faced commercial limitations because of its long runtime, restricting the number of times it could be screened daily, and its violent content.[10][64][63]DreamWorks' marketing chief Terry Press said it was risky to release a serious drama in the summer, a time generally reserved for family and escapist entertainment, but this was offset by Spielberg and Hanks's popularity.[15]A screening for DreamWorks and Paramount executives was highly praised,[11]but Spielberg had low expectations, believing the film was too violent to attract broad audiences.[65]Box office[edit]The film premiered on July 21, 1998. The event was a low-profile affair without a party or many celebrities; Press said of the premiere, ""it would have been inappropriate"".[66]Saving Private Ryanwas released in the United States and Canada on July 24, 1998.[10][67]During its opening weekend, it  earned $30.6million across 2,463 theaters—an average of $12,414 per theater.[67][10]This figure made it the number-one film of the weekend, ahead ofThe Mask of Zorro($13.4million) in its second weekend,Lethal Weapon 4($13.1million) in its third, andThere's Something About Mary($12.5million), also in its second.[68][15]The audience was split evenly between women and men, and skewed towards those aged over 25.The New York Timesdescribed it as unusual for a near-three-hour-long drama to perform so well on its opening weekend, crediting positive reviews. DreamWorks believed the box-office figure would have been higher if not for a delay in film prints arriving in hundreds of theaters across California and Arizona until late in the afternoon.[15]In its second weekend,Saving Private Ryanremained the number-one film, with $23.6million, ahead of the debutingThe Parent Trap($11.1million) andThere's Something About Mary($10.9million) in its third.[69][70]Saving Private Ryanretained the number-one position in its third weekend with ($17.4million), ahead of the debuts ofSnake Eyes($16.3million) andHalloween H20: 20 Years Later($16.1million), and its fourth with $13.2million, ahead of the debuts ofHow Stella Got Her Groove Back($11.3million) andThe Avengers($10.3million).[71][72]In its fifth weekend,Saving Private Ryanfell to number2 with $10.1million, behind the debut ofBlade($17.1million).[73]Without regaining the number1 position, it ranked among the top ten for 12 weeks.[67]By the end of its theatrical run,Saving Private Ryanearned a total box-office gross of $216.5million, making it the highest-grossing film of the year, ahead ofArmageddon($201.6million) andThere's Something About Mary($176.5million).[74][27]This also made it only the third R-rated film to earn more than $200million, after 1984'sBeverly Hills Cop($235million) and 1991'sTerminator 2: Judgment Day($205million).[75]Outside of the U.S. and Canada,Saving Private Ryanis estimated to have earned a further $265.3million. This gave the film a cumulative worldwide gross of $481.8million, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1998, behindArmageddon($553.7million).[76][27][iii]Saving Private Ryanwas seen as the biggest success of the theatrical summer.The New York Timeswrote that the success of a ""prestige film"" during a time of blockbuster entertainment with broad appeal was evidence that audiences were accepting of serious dramas alongside action films, such asArmageddonandGodzilla, and ""gross-out comedy"" likeThere's Something About Mary. The publication wrote that the popularity ofSaving Private Ryanwas, in part, because it depicted a ""nobler, cleaner era"" promoting values of heroism and ""patriotic duty"".[77]The 1998 box office broke records with over $7billion earned. Despite expectations, the biggest successes had relatively modest budgets, such asSaving Private Ryan,There's Something About Mary,Rush Hour, andThe Waterboy, while the anticipated blockbusters, such asGodzillaandArmageddon, were so expensive to make that they were less profitable.[78]Re-releases ofSaving Private Ryanhave raised the box office to $482.3million.[1]Spielberg's and Hanks's pay agreement earned them an estimated $30–$40 million each of the box office.[10][15][79]Reception[edit]Critical response[edit]Steven Spielberg(pictured in 2017) andJanusz Kamiński(2014). The pair earned critical acclaim for their respective direction and cinematography ofSaving Private RyanSaving Private Ryanreceived critical acclaim,[27][80]and audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.[81]Critics generally agreed thatSaving Private Ryanpresented the grim and brutal reality of the ""Good War"" in a way previously unseen on film.[o]Writing for theLos Angeles Times,Kenneth Turandescribed the film as darker and more pessimistic than any of Spielberg's previous works, dispelling the mythos of WWII as staunchly good heroes fighting against evil forces, to depict the reality of combat where, ""American soldiers mock virtue and shoot surrendering Germans, where decent and altruistic actions tend to be fatal, where death is random, stupid and redeems hardly anything at all"".[82][85]Some reviewers said this exploration of the limitations of morality in combat asked audiences to consider that the lives lost during the conflict were as valuable as those saved by their sacrifices. Writing for theChicago Tribune,Gene Siskellauded the film's ability to discuss the ""brutality and madness"" of war while ""believably"" celebrating the sacrifices and courage of those fighting it.[84][58][86]Salon.com's Gary Kamiya concluded, ""it will forever change the way people imagine the most important event in 20th century history. That is no small achievement.""[82]InThe New York Times,Stephen Holdensaid ""it's a safe bet thatSaving Private Ryan, a powerful but flawed movie, will be revered as a classic decades hence.""[77]Many reviewers focused on the film's two major combat sequences, particularly the opening on Omaha Beach.[p]Focus was on the ""horrifying,"" ""visceral,"" ""brutal,"" ""shocking,"" and ""fierce"" violence present in the opening battle, described byEntertainment Weekly'sOwen GleibermanandTime'sRichard Schickelas one of the most revolutionary film sequences ever made.[87][86][58][82]Roger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timesand Schickel compared it with the energy and dread of similar scenes in the Vietnam war filmPlatoon(1986), but with a grander scope depicting masses of men killing each other from afar, drawing the ""horror"" out of a lengthy, sustained sequence, without the audience being allowed to become desensitized.[58][88][57]Some reviewers believed that the scene was so impactful and thought-provoking that it overshadowed the rest of the film.[86][82]Although there was some criticism toward the realistic violence and gore, Turan believed it was done purposely and dispassionately, conveying the chaos and despair experienced by the soldiers, and not done for the sake of entertainment.[85]Spielberg rejected this criticism, affirming he wanted the audience to understand what real combat was like and what the soldiers experienced, not observe it from afar as spectators.[38][83]Some reviewers believed the concluding battle in Ramelle was more violent than Omaha Beach, particularly the slow death of Mellish as he is stabbed through the chest.[82][87]The New York Observer'sAndrew Sarriscriticized the ""pornography of violence and cruelty"" depicted in severed limbs and rivers of blood.[89]Turan andJonathan Rosenbaumfound that, outside of the combat, the script was effective but uninspired and derivative of war films by other directors, such asOliver Stone,Stanley Kubrick, andFrancis Ford Coppola.[85][82][90][89]Others criticized ""manipulative"" oversentimentality, particularly in the modern dayframing devicefeaturing the elderly Ryan.[85][89]Even so, Kamiya described it as ""enormously moving, it serves as a kind of redemption, a necessary if eternally fragile answer to the hell he witnessed"".[82]Hanks's performance was generally praised, with some reviewers calling it the best of his career to date.[82][86][84][57]Many reviewers agreed that hiseverymanpersona allowed him to portray Miller with a gentle weariness, empathy, and vulnerability beneath a surface of strength and decency, but also cynicism toward the war.[82][84][85][86]Ebert and Schickel wrote that he offered a quiet reserve ""hinting at unspoken competencies"" that convince his men and the audience to follow along with him.[84]Turan believed that Hanks's ""indelible"" performance represented how the audience would hope to be when confronted by the same situations.[85]The other main cast also generally received positive reviews, particularly Davies, with Ebert saying that his transformation from inexperienced interpreter to soldier was the conclusion to ""Spielberg's unspoken philosophical argument"".[q]Gleiberman and Turan also highlighted the performances of Pepper, Ribisi, and Sizemore, who Turan believed delivered his career's ""best, most controlled"" performance.[85]Ebert praised the cast for not devolving into cliché or ""zany"" archetypes and effectively portraying the bonds between them.[82][58]However, Kamiya wrote that Damon's performance was ""jarring"", believing both his more cinematic aesthetic and speech about his brothers to be artificial. The review concluded that Ryan was not very compelling, which made it difficult to care about the mission to save him.[82]Accolades[edit]At the56th Golden Globe Awardsin 1999,Saving Private RyanwonBest DramaandBest Director(Spielberg), and was nominated forBest Drama Actor(Hanks),Best Original Score(Williams), andBest Screenplay(Rodat).[91][92]At the71st Academy Awards,Saving Private RyanwonBest Director(Spielberg),Best Cinematography(Kamiński),Best Film Editing(Kahn),Best Sound(Gary Rydstrom,Gary Summers,Andy Nelson,Ronald Judkins), andBest Sound Effects Editing(Rydstrom and Richard Hymns) while it was nominated forBest Actor(Hanks),Best Original Screenplay(Rodat),Best Music(Williams),Best Production Design(Sanders andLisa Dean Kavanaugh), andBest Makeup(Lois Burwell,Conor O'Sullivan,Daniel C.

Sargenton June 6, 1944.Saving Private Ryanwas lauded for its accurate recreation of theOmaha BeachlandingsSeveral publications highlighted the accuracy of the Omaha Beach assault, down to the sound of gunfire, although some errors were noted, such as bullets killing soldiers underwater, the absence of Britishcoxswainssteering the boats, and the battle's truncated duration.[13][94][112][113]Historical curator John Delaney said:It's accurate for that unit on that bit of that beach on that day... but you can't say, 'That's what D-Day was like', because it wasn't. Omaha beach is about three and a half miles [5.6 km] long. What's happening at one end of the beach isn't what's happening at the other end.[114]Discussing the core narrative, Ambrose said, ""It's a stretch that they would send eight soldiers, but it could have been hard to find him... the paratroopers were scattered everywhere.""[29]Many World War II veterans described the opening ofSaving Private Ryanas depicting the most realistic representation of combat. Another veteran, interviewed byTime, said ""I remember when I walked out into the lobby of the moviehouse, not a single person coming out of that showing said one word... everybody was stunned by it... It just brought back so many memories.""[112][115]There were various reports of some veterans being unable to finish watchingSaving Private Ryanbecause of the memories it brought back.[s]TheUnited States Department of Veterans Affairscreated a dedicated phoneline for viewers affected by the film, and more veterans visited counselors forpost traumatic stress disorder.[27][15][117]The rest of the film is less historically accurate. Fictitious elements include the nonexistent town of Ramelle, the battle associated with it, certain military tactical errors (included for dramatic effect), much of the dialogue, and some of the methods used to locate Ryan.[94][112]Total Filmand some non U.S. veterans were critical of the lack of other Allied forces throughout the film.[113][118]British broadcasterChannel 4said that these critics had missed the point of the film, in that it was ""unashamedly an American story"".[119]Home media[edit]Saving Private Ryanwas released onVHSin May 1999.[120]It became the most successful rental debut of its time, earning $9.6million in its first week and $44million by July 1999.[121][27]A limited edition two-VHS version was released in November 1999, adding a making-of documentary, as well as a message from Spielberg about D-Day and theNational D-Day Museum.[121]ADVDwas released alongside the limited edition VHS, with the same extras.[122][123]A two-disc Special Collector's Edition DVD set was released in May 2004 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of D-Day.[124]This edition included additional content, includingbehind-the-scenescontent recorded during filming. Spielberg discussed his interest in WWII, the Niland brothers, the story and character development, the cast's boot camp experience, the involvement of the Irish army and locations, the recreation of Omaha Beach, the music, sound effects, and a farewell from Spielberg.[124]This was released alongside a four-disc deluxe ""The World War II Collection"" DVD package that included a collectible book and two documentaries:Price for Peace(directed byJames Moll) about the use of dogs in WWII, andShooting War(directed by Richard Schickel) about combat photographers, with narration by Hanks.[123][125]Saving Private Ryanwas released as a two-discBlu-rayin May 2010, including all previously released special features apart fromPrice for Peace.[126][127]Paramount Home Entertainmentissued a recall of the Blu-rays after discovering that some versions featured an audio synchronization issue. The defect was fixed in versions re-released later that month.[128]For the film's 20th anniversary in 2018, a three-disc ""Commemorative 20th Anniversary"" Blu-ray set was released, including a4K Ultra HD Blu-rayand all previously released features.[129]Other media[edit]A novelization, written byMax Allan Collinsand Rodat, was released alongside the film.[130][131]Saving Private Ryan: The Men, the Mission, the Movie : A Film by Steven Spielbergwas also released in 1998. It features illustrations, color plates, extracts from the screenplay and Ambrose's works, as well as commentary by crew including Spielberg, Hanks, and Damon.[132][133]Thematic analysis[edit]Patriotism[edit]Leading into the early 21st century, there was renewed focus in America on glorifying the generation that had fought in WWII, depicted in films such asSaving Private RyanandThe Thin Red Line, the miniseriesBand of Brothers(2001), books such asThe Greatest Generation(1998), and construction of aWorld War II Memorialin Washington, D.C.[t]Many publications believed this resurgence of interest in the war to be a response to decades of American cynicism toward the nation'sfailure in the Vietnam War(1955–1975), and anticlimactic victories in theColdandGulf Warsthat resulted in little diplomatic success or celebration.[u]Many films about the Vietnam War depicted its American combatants as self-hating, ""deeply troubled, or even psychotic,"" offered little respect, and portrayed the conflict itself as one mired in dread, anxiety, and general negativity.[134][77][88][135]Literature professor Marzena Sokołowska-Paryż said the worship of WWII as ""the last Good War"" and its veterans as ""thegreatest generation"" represented a ""therapeutic [form of] patriotism"" designed to rehabilitate the modern image of combatants as the enduring legacy of WWII soldiers and the core American national identity while forgetting any lingering guilt over the Vietnam War.[135][77]Film scholar Albert Auster described this reappraisal as a reversal of attitudes up to the early 1990s where historical wars, including WWII, were not beyond criticism and, particularly in response to the Vietnam War, literary critics aimed to undo the impression of WWII as the ""Good War"".[136]Saving Private Ryanis American-centric, beginning and ending with an image of the nation's flag fluttering in the wind, a desaturated image suggesting a nostalgic image of ""the deep pride we once felt in our flag"".[88][138][119]Stephen Holden described it as ""a wholehearted celebration of American pluck and virtue and honor"".[77]Holden and Ebert disagreed with the view of some critics thatSaving Private Ryan's ""harrowing"" and realistic combat scenes were astatement against war. They wrote that it accepts war as a necessity and portrays its main characters not as symbols, but as real people trying to kill the enemy without getting themselves killed.[77][18][28][139]The scenes of the elderly Ryan visiting Miller's grave with his family received some criticism.[77][138]AuthorJohn Biguenetqueried how such a ""savage and unsentimental film"" could conclude with a scene so sentimentalized. Spielberg said in making the film he was meant to ""wave the flag and be patriotic,"" but that the reality of his father's experiences made him want to also convey the harsh reality.[138]The Omaha Beach landing establishes the distance between the commanders safe at home who order Ryan be rescued, and the soldiers endangered in doing so.[58][140]It is a sentimental mission intended to spare one family the grief of losing all of its sons, but Miller refers to it as a public relations scheme designed to boost civilian morale.[28][138]General Marshall quotes a letter by Abraham Lincoln to a similarly affected family, but where Lincoln's letter expresses sentiment and patriotic sacrifice to the mother, it is not sentimental nor does it claim that her grief is greater than any other mother who lost her child at war.[141][138]Biguenet said Marshall, in comparison, confuses sentimentality for morality.[138]Despite the patriotic American imagery, the characters ofSaving Private Ryando not discuss their home country or protecting democracy fromfascism. The soldiers are only concerned with returning home to their loved ones. Miller's men openly state that they do not care about Ryan, but Miller says that he will go into metaphorical Hell to save him, if it means Miller can return to his wife. The soldiers actively fighting are not sentimental about their mission.[138]Turan and Biguenet saidSaving Private Ryan""feels like an official act of atonement"" for modern generations failing to acknowledge the ""courage and sacrifice"" of WWII soldiers. When Miller tells Ryan to ""earn this,"" he is effectively speaking about the debt owed to veterans who made ""the ultimate sacrifice"" for their country.[77][138][19][142]Biguenet called this a ""terrible, impossible order"", a moral burden that Ryan will carry until his own death because there is no way to compensate the high price paid by Miller's men. Spielberg suggested the answer was in the living paying homage to the fallen soldiers and the freedom for which they fought.[138]History professor John Bodnar described the image of the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial as depicting a national unity with row after row of white grave markers, serving as a permanent reminder ""to other nations of the sacrifices made by the United States"".[140]Morality and humanity[edit]Unlike some older WWII films that portrayed the soldiers as infallible heroes,Saving Private Ryanpresents battles fought by brave but frightened civilians, the majority of whom at Omaha Beach were not combat veterans.[138][28]Ebert believed much of the audience, including himself, would identify with Upham, someone completely unprepared for the realities of war but who must fight regardless.[58]Miller is the opposite: an experienced soldier who is scared and anxious because he knows exactly what to expect and is haunted by his responsibility for the lives of his men.[138][28][85][4]Although 94 men have died under his command, Miller rationalizes that he can prioritize his mission over his men because each sacrifice was responsible for saving many more lives. However, his mission to rescue Ryan demands he risk the lives of several men to save just one.[138]Turan said Miller's trembling hands were a sign that he is ""dangerously close to coming apart"".[85]Far Outmagazine wrote that the focus on Miller's ailment acknowledges the side effects of war such as post-traumatic stress disorder, something he suppresses to fulfil his duty.[4]Spielberg said the mission to rescue Ryan cannot be morally or patriotically justified, risking eight lives to save one. This theme is reinforced when they encounter the sole survivor of a glider crash caused by heavy steel shielding added to protect a single general on board, resulting in 22 deaths. No character claims that the mission of Miller and his men is heroic, and the men express the grief their own mothers will feel should they be killed on this endeavor. The ""toughest"" soldier, Horvath, gives it meaning when he tells Miller that saving Ryan could be the one decent thing they can accomplish in ""this whole godawful, shitty mess"". Biguenet said that Spielberg is explicitly condemning their mission as an immoral act to force upon soldiers.[138]Ebert considered the decision to deviate from the mission to attack the German gun nest on the way to Ramelle to be a deliberate rebellion against their orders. The action is not part of their mission and it is possible to avoid the situation entirely, but it grants the soldiers the opportunity to do what they came to Europe for: to fight a war.[58]Hanks said the decision to stay with Ryan and defend Ramelle was the characters ""bringing meaning to a situation that until then had been absurd"".[28]While film critic Andrew Sarris found the German characters to match evil archetypes found in other WWII films, concluding with Upham's lesson that Steamboat Willie should have been killed earlier,Saving Private Ryandoes not portray the Allied soldiers as unimpeachable heroes.[89][143][138]Following Omaha Beach, two Allied soldiers laugh as they execute two pleading German soldiers, but the soldiers are speaking Czech, indicating they are potentially from German-conquered Czechoslovakia, forcibly conscripted into the war effort.[143][138]Biguenet wrote that the Germans are not portrayed as any worse than the Americans, as they are similarly affected by the horrors of war and casually execute downed American soldiers. InSaving Private Ryan, allegiances do not matter, all men are equal, and rules only matter until they conflict with the mission objective.[144][145]Upham's transformation from cowardly interpreter to Willie's executioner shows the transformative realities of combat.[138]William J. Priorand Auster wrote that Upham represents respect for human life and moral decency when he interferes to prevent Steamboat Willie's execution, despite the fact that it would protect the mission. He offers the intellectual perspective of a civilian, but his lack of combat experience makes him unable to kill the prisoner, which results in the deaths of many of his allies.[144][145]Miller's experience means he is conscious of the risk involved in releasing Willie, but he is simultaneously struggling to cling to his own humanity and decency, believing that every time he kills he is moving ""farther from home"". Although Willie is the enemy, he is also a human with his own right to exist, and summarily executing him would further distance Miller from the self he and his wife knew.[146]His decision to spare Willie and reveal his civilian background, returns to him a semblance of his humanity.[145]Legacy[edit]Cultural influence[edit]See also:World War II in popular cultureSaving Private Ryanwas credited with renewing interest in World War II leading into the 21st century.[147][27][148]NBC Newswrote that in presenting audiences with its ""stomach-churning violence and soul-shaking intensity of that pivotal chapter in the war"", the film had reshaped the United States' ""cultural memory"".[149]It is regarded as one of the most accurate and realistic war films ever made, particularly for the opening Omaha Beach battle.[150][149]Film historian Steven Jay Rubin said, ""It was a game-changer... it was devastatingly dramatic, visceral, immersive. I didn't touch my popcorn because it felt sacrilegious to eat while I'm watching it.""[149]Even so, director and Vietnam War veteran Oliver Stone claimed thatSaving Private Ryandepicted a ""worship"" of WWII as ""the good war"" that, alongside films such asGladiator(2000) andBlack Hawk Down, made audiences more in favor of war: ""By the time of theIraq War, we were ready to go back.""[151]American academicPaul Fussellsimilarly decriedSaving Private Ryanfor providing an ""honest, harrowing, 15-minute opening"" of Omaha Beach before descending into more broadly acceptable action-adventure fare. He said, ""Its genre was pure cowboys and Indians, with the virtuous cowboys of course victorious.""[152]The film is considered to have had a lasting influence on filmmaking, particularly its opening battle scenes.[v]Vanity Fairwrote, ""no films about combat made since would look the way they do without the de-saturated, handheld, blood-splatters-and-all horror of cinema that is this extended sequence... it's a terrifying scene, either honorable or exploitative in its all vérité, depending on whom you ask. Regardless of any moral assessment, it's easily one of the most aped and referenced scenes of the late 20th century.""[153][147]Saving Private Ryanwas named by other directors as an influence, such asQuentin Tarantino(Inglourious Basterds, 2009),Christopher Nolan(Dunkirk, 2017), andRobert Altman.[w]TheLos Angeles Timeswrote thatSaving Private Ryan's stylistic choices, such as placing the audience close to the on-screen action, can be seen in war and action media that followed. This includes films such asGladiator(2000),Enemy at the Gates,Pearl Harbor(both 2001),Flags of Our Fathers(2006), andHacksaw Ridge(2016), the ""psychological anguish"" ofAmerican Sniper(2014), and modern superhero films.[19][149]This influence extends to television, with shows such asGame of Thrones(""The Spoils of War"", 2017) andThe Pacific(2010).[19][157]Saving Private Ryanis also seen as an influence on video games.[153][149]Spielberg and DreamWorks developedMedal of Honor(1999) to translate the realism and setting ofSaving Private Ryan. Its success launched aseries ofMedal of Honorgames, which, in turn, contributed to the creation of theCall of Dutyseries.[158][159][160]Retrospective reception[edit]Saving Private Ryanis considered one of thegreatest war films ever made.[x]In a 2018 interview, Spielberg said, ""I didn't anticipate the success of the movie... in very early screenings, certain associates and other people in my life were saying that I made it too tough. I feared that almost nobody would see it because the word of mouth would spread quickly after the first 25 minutes.""[19]In 2007, theAmerican Film Institute(AFI) listedSaving Private Ryanas71st-greatest American film.[172]The AFI listed it among the mostthrilling,inspiring, andepicAmerican films.[173][174][175]A 2014 poll of 2,120 entertainment industry professionals byThe Hollywood ReporterrankedSaving Private Ryanas the 46th-best film.[176]Publications such asParadeandVarietynamed it one of the greatest films of all time.[y]Saving Private Ryanis included in the 2013 film reference book1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die,[181]and it is listed onRotten Tomatoes' 300 essential movies.[182]The film is generally considered to be among the best of Spielberg's works,[z]and of Hanks's credits.[aa]In a 2025 retrospective byVulture,Saving Private Ryanwas listed among the best movies to have not won the Best Picture Academy Award.[196]On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating across 149 critics, with an average score of 8.7/10. The consensus reads; ""Anchored by another winning performance from Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg's unflinchingly realistic war film virtually redefines the genre.""[197]The film has a score of 91 out of 100 onMetacritic, based on 38 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[198]Saving Private Ryanhas remained popular with audiences, with reader and viewer-ranked polling listing it as one of the greatest war films,[199][200]among the greatest films of the 1990s, and the greatest films of all time.[201][202]Footnotes[edit]^This is the cumulative box office gross of the original theatrical release and re-releases.[1]^The 1998 budget of $65–$70million is equivalent to $125 million–$135 million in 2024.^The 1998 theatrical box office gross of $481.8million  is equivalent to $929 million in 2024.Notes[edit]^Attributed to multiple references:[10][11][15][24]^Attributed to multiple references:[14][18][25][26]^Attributed to multiple references:[14][18][20][25]^Attributed to multiple references:[29][31][32][33]^Attributed to multiple references:[5][6][13][18]^Attributed to multiple references:[13][14][18][20][34]^Attributed to multiple references:[25][45][13][12]^Attributed to multiple references:[25][47][12][40][20][14][47][38]^Attributed to multiple references:[45][47][46][38][25]^Attributed to multiple references:[45][47][12][7][25]^Attributed to multiple references:[25][12][50][51]^Attributed to multiple references:[48][7][40][20]^Attributed to multiple references:[11][12][10][15]^Attributed to multiple references:[20][56][57][58]^Attributed to multiple references:[82][83][58][57][84]^Attributed to multiple references:[15][58][83][87][82][85]^Attributed to multiple references:[57][87][58][82][84][86]^Attributed to multiple references:[94][95][96][97][98]^Attributed to multiple references:[13][27][116][45]^Attributed to multiple references:[134][77][88][135][136]^Attributed to multiple references:[134][77][88][135][136][137]^Attributed to multiple references:[149][147][153][154][94][19][155][156]^Attributed to multiple references:[154][94][19][155][156][149]^Attributed to multiple references:[6][161][162][163][164][165][166][167][168][169][170][94][171][12]^Attributed to multiple references:[177][178][179][180]^Attributed to multiple references:[183][184][185][186][187][188][189]^Attributed to multiple references:[190][191][192][193][194][195]References[edit]Citations[edit]^ab""Saving Private Ryan(1998)"".Box Office Mojo.Archivedfrom the original on January 12, 2023.

He is found by slave traders, who take him toZuccabarin theRoman provinceofMauretania Caesariensisand sell him to thegladiatortrainer Proximo.Maximus reluctantly fights in local tournaments, his combat skills helping him win matches and gain popularity. He earns the nickname ""theSpaniard"" and befriends Juba, a gladiator fromCarthage, and Hagen, a gladiator fromGermania. InRome, Commodus organizes 150 days of gladiatorial games to commemorate his father and win the approval of theRoman public. Upon hearing this, Proximo reveals to Maximus that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises him to ""win the crowd"" to gain his freedom.Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome'sColosseum. Disguised in a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in the arena as aCarthaginianin a re-enactment of theBattle of Zama. Unexpectedly, he leads his side to victory and wins the crowd's support. Commodus and his young nephew, Lucius, enter the Colosseum to offer their congratulations. Seeing Lucius, Maximus refrains from attacking Commodus, who orders him to reveal his identity. Maximus removes his helmet and declares his intent to seek vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let Maximus live. That evening, Maximus is visited byLucilla, his former lover and Commodus' sister. Distrusting her, Maximus refuses her help.Commodus arranges a duel between Maximus and Tigris ofGaul, an undefeated gladiator. Several tigers are set upon Maximus, but he prevails. At the crowd's desire, Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his life in defiance. In response, the crowd chants ""Maximus the Merciful"", angering Commodus. To provoke Maximus, Commodus taunts him about the murder of his family, but Maximus resists the urge to strike him. Increasingly paranoid, Commodus instructs his advisor, Falco, to have everysenatorfollowed, and refuses to have Maximus killed for fear he will become amartyr.Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal to him. He secretly meets with Lucilla and Gracchus, an influential senator. They agree to help Maximus escape Rome to join his legions inOstia, oust Commodus by force, and hand power back to theRoman Senate. The Praetorians arrest Gracchus. Lucilla meets Maximus at night to arrange his escape; they share a kiss. Commodus becomes suspicious when Lucius innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorians attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape, but Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed.Commodus demands that Lucilla provide him with an heir. He challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum to win back public approval and stabs him before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injury, Maximus disarms Commodus during the duel. After Quintus and the Praetorians refuse to help him, Commodus unsheathes a hidden knife; Maximus overpowers Commodus and drives the knife into his throat, killing him. Before Maximus succumbs to his wound, he asks for political reforms, theemancipationof his gladiator allies, and the reinstatement of Gracchus as a senator. As he dies, Maximus envisions reuniting with his wife and son in theafterlife. His friends and allies honor him as ""a soldier of Rome"" and carry his body out of the arena. That night, Juba visits the Colosseum and buries figurines of Maximus' wife and son at the spot where Maximus died.Cast[edit]Russell Crowe (left, pictured in 1999) and Joaquin Phoenix (pictured in 2000)Russell Croweas the fictional character Maximus Decimus Meridius: AHispano-Romangeneral forced into slavery who seeks revenge against Emperor Commodus for the murder of his family and the previous emperor, Marcus Aurelius.Joaquin Phoenixas Commodus (based on the historical figureCommodus): The amoral and power-hungry son of Marcus Aurelius.

""Everywhere I went in Europe, there were arenas"", Franzoni recalled. ""Even as I went east, going through Turkey, I began to think to myself this must have been a hell of a franchise."" During a stop in Baghdad, Iraq, he started reading the 1958Daniel P. MannixnovelThose About to Die,[a]which gave him the idea forGladiator.[7]Twenty-five years later, Franzoni wrote the screenplay forSteven Spielberg'sAmistad,which was Spielberg's first film for DreamWorks Pictures. ThoughAmistadwas only a moderate commercial success, DreamWorks was impressed with Franzoni's screenplay and gave him a three-picture deal as writer and co-producer.[8]Remembering his 1972 trip, Franzoni pitched his gladiator story idea to Spielberg, who immediately told him to write the script.[7]After reading the ancient Roman textHistoria Augusta, Franzoni chose to center the story on Commodus. The protagonist wasNarcissus, a wrestler who, according to the ancient historians Herodian and Cassius Dio, strangled Commodus to death.[8]Pollice Versoby Jean-Léon GérômeDreamWorks producersWalter F. ParkesandDouglas Wickfelt that Ridley Scott would be the ideal director to bring Franzoni's story to life.[9]They showed him a copy ofJean-Léon Gérôme's 1872 paintingPollice Verso, which Scott said portrays the Roman Empire ""in all its glory and wickedness"".[10]He was so captivated by the image that he immediately agreed to direct the film. When Parkes pointed out that Scott did not know anything about the story, Scott replied, ""I don’t care, I’ll do it"".[11]Once Scott was on board, he and Franzoni discussed films that could influenceGladiator, such asOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,La Dolce Vita, andThe Conformist.[7]However, Scott felt Franzoni's dialogue lacked subtlety, and he hired John Logan to rewrite the script. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus' family to increase the character's desire for revenge.[12]In November 1998, DreamWorks reached a deal withUniversal Picturesto help finance the film: DreamWorks would distribute the film in North America, while Universal Pictures would distribute it internationally.[13]Casting[edit]Before Russell Crowe was cast as Maximus, several other actors were considered for the role, includingAntonio Banderas,Mel Gibson, andTom Cruise.[7]Gibson turned down the role as he was already committed toThe Patriot(2000).[14]However, producers had Crowe at the top of their list after his breakout performance inL.A. Confidential(1997).[7]Jude Lawauditioned for Commodus, but Joaquin Phoenix was offered the part after sending in a ""knockout"" audition tape.[15][7]Jennifer Lopezreportedly auditioned for Lucilla, but the role went to Connie Nielsen.[16]Lou Ferrignowas originally offered the role of Tigris of Gaul, but the role went toSven-Ole Thorsen.[17][18]Principal photography[edit]The film was shot at three main locations between January and May 1999.[19]The opening battle scene set in the forests ofGermaniawas shot atBourne Wood, near Farnham, Surrey, in England.[20]When Scott learned that the Forestry Commission was planning to remove a section of the forest, he obtained permission to burn it down for the scene.[21]The scenes of slavery, desert travel, and the gladiatorial training school were shot inOuarzazate, Morocco. The scenes set in Rome were shot inMalta, where the crew built a replica of about one-third of the Colosseum to a height of 52 feet (16 meters). The other two-thirds and remaining height were added digitally.[22][23]The scenes of Maximus' farm were filmed inVal d'Orcia, Italy.[24]When filming battle scenes, Scott and cinematographerJohn Mathiesonused multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and used a45-degree shutter, which resulted in stylized visuals similar to those found inSaving Private Ryan.[25]For the fight sequence involving tigers, both real tigers and a dummy tiger were used. Some of the live animals were filmed on set with the actors, and some were filmed against abluescreenand then digitally composited into the scene.[26][27]Crowe was injured multiple times duringprincipal photography. Describing the impact filming had on his body, Crowe said, ""I've still got a lot of little scar[s]"". He added, ""I've had Achilles tendons go out, knees go out, both shoulders, this shoulder's actually had an operation on it... I've got a lower back thing that just won't go away, and that's from a couple, sort of, fall impacts during fight sequences"".[16]Oliver Reed died of a heart attack on May 2, before all his scenes had been filmed. His character, Proximo, was meant to survive, but after Reed's death the script was revised to include his death at the hands of the Praetorian Guard. To make it appear that Reed had performed the entirety of Proximo's scenes, a body double was used, and Reed's face was digitally attached to the body of the double in post-production.[b]The film is dedicated to Reed.Script complaints and revisions[edit]Although Franzoni and Logan completed a second draft of the screenplay in October 1998, Crowe has claimed that the script was ""substantially underdone"" when filming began three months later. In an interview withInside the Actors Studio, Crowe said the crew ""started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.""[31][32]The script was constantly changing throughout principal photography, with Scott soliciting input from writers, producers and actors.[11]Some dialogue was created on the spot, such as Commodus' line ""Am I not merciful?"", which was ad-libbed by Phoenix.[16]Crowe invented the phrase ""Strength and Honor"", which is a modified version of the Latin motto of his high school, ""Veritate et Virtute"", which translates as ""Truth and Virtue"".[32]Crowe also improvised part of the scene in which Maximus describes his home to Marcus Aurelius. Instead of recounting the details of a fictional place, Crowe actually described his own home in Australia.[33]At one point, William Nicholson was hired to rewrite the script to make Maximus a more sensitive character. He reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife plot thread. He said he ""did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody"".[12]Crowe, however, was unhappy with some of Nicholson's dialogue. He allegedly called it ""garbage"", but is said to have claimed he is ""the greatest actor in the world"" and can ""make even garbage sound good.""[16]According to a DreamWorks executive, Crowe ""tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.""[34]Music[edit]Main article:Gladiator (2000 soundtrack)The musical score forGladiatorwas composed byHans ZimmerandLisa Gerrard, and conducted byGavin Greenaway. The original soundtrack for the film was produced byDecca Recordsand released on April 25, 2000. Decca later released three follow-up albums:Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture(2001),Gladiator: Special Anniversary Edition(2005), andGladiator: 20th Anniversary Edition(2020).[citation needed]In 2025, La La Land Records released a three discs expanded edition for the 25th anniversary.""Now We Are Free""Hans Zimmer and Lisa GerrardListen to a clip from theGladiatorscoreProblems playing this file?

Its total gross in the United States and Canada was$187.7 million.[40]Gladiatoropened on May 12, 2000, in the United Kingdom, and grossed £3.5 million in its opening weekend. It spent seven weeks atnumber one, and its total gross surpassed$43 million.[c]The film was also number one for seven weeks in Italy, and for five weeks in France.[d]Outside of the United States and Canada,Gladiatorgrossed$277.8 million, for a total worldwide gross of$465.5 millionagainst a budget of$110 million.[40]It was the second-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2000, behindMission: Impossible 2($546.3 million).[47]Subsequent theatrical releases[edit]In 2020,Gladiatorwas re-released in Australia and the Netherlands to commemorate its 20th anniversary. This limited release grossed$4.8 million. The following year, it was re-released in the United Kingdom, earning a gross of$16,257.[40]Home media[edit]Gladiatorwas first released on DVD and VHS on November 21, 2000, and generated$60 millionin sales within the first week.[48][49]With new releases in subsequent years, the film grossed $15.8 million.[50]In September 2009, the film was released byParamount Home Entertainmenton Blu-ray, re-released in August 2010 in a higher quality transfer, and in May 2018 it was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray.[51]An extended version of the film, with 16 extra minutes of footage, is also available on all three formats.[52][53][54]Reception[edit]Critical response[edit]Gladiatorwas called ""magnificent"", ""compelling"", and ""richly enjoyable"" by some critics.[e]Crowe's performance in particular received praise. Writing forThe Wall Street Journal,Joe Morgenstensaid that Crowe ""doesn't use tricks in this role to court our approval. He earns it the old-fashioned way, by daring to be quiet, if not silent, and intensely, implacably strong.""[58]Kenneth Turanof theLos Angeles Timeswrote that Crowe brings an ""essential physical and psychological reality to the role"", while Kirk Honeycutt ofThe Hollywood Reportersaid that Crowe uses ""his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics.""[59][60]Varietycalled Crowe's performance ""simply splendid"".[56]Critics also praised Scott's directing and the visual style of the film.Manohla DargisofLA Weeklycommended Scott's state of the art filmmaking and expressed admiration for the film's ""breathtaking, brutal lyricism"".[61]Entertainment Weeklycalled the opening battle sequence ""extraordinary"", and described Scott as a ""visual artist at his most deluxe.""[62]Michael Wilmington ofThe Chicago TribunecalledGladiator""visually electrifying"".[55]In addition to Crowe's acting and Scott's directing, reviewers also applauded John Mathieson'scinematography,Arthur Max's production design, and the musical score composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard.[f]Although critics lauded many aspects ofGladiator, some derided the screenplay. Ian Nathan ofEmpiremagazine called the dialogue ""pompous"", ""overwritten"", and ""prone to plain silliness"".[63]Roger Ebertsaid the script ""employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.""[64]Manohla Dargis called the story predictable and formulaic.[61]In his 2004 bookThe Assassination of Julius Caesar,the political scientistMichael ParentidescribedGladiatoras ""unencumbered by any trace of artistic merit"". He also criticized the film's depiction of Roman citizens, claiming that it portrays them as bloodthirsty savages.[65]Brandon Zachary of the entertainment websiteScreenRanthas claimed that the plot ofGladiatorborrows heavily from the 1964 filmThe Fall of the Roman Empire, which is also about the transition from Marcus Aurelius to Commodus and the latter's downfall.[66]Audiences polled onGladiator's opening day by the market research firmCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A"" on an A+ to F scale.[67][better source needed]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 80% of 257 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The website's consensus reads: ""While not everyone will be entertained byGladiator'sglum revenge story, Russell Crowe thunderously wins the crowd with a star-making turn that provides Ridley Scott's opulent resurrection of Rome its bruised heart.""[68]OnMetacritic, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating ""generally favorable"" reviews.[69]Accolades[edit]Main article:List of accolades received by GladiatorGladiatorwon five awards at the73rd Academy Awards, and was nominated for an additional seven.WinsBest PictureBest Actor(Russell Crowe)Best Visual EffectsBest SoundBest Costume DesignAdditional nominationsBest DirectorBest Original ScreenplayBest Supporting Actor(Joaquin Phoenix)Best Original ScoreBest CinematographyBest Art DirectionBest Film Editing[70]At the58th Golden Globe Awards,Gladiatorwon two awards and was nominated for an additional three.WinsBest Motion Picture – DramaBest Original Score – Motion PictureAdditional nominationsBest Actor – Motion Picture Drama(Russell Crowe)Best DirectorBest Supporting Actor – Motion Picture Drama(Joaquin Phoenix)[71]Gladiatoralso won theBAFTA Award for Best Film.[72]In 2021,Empiremagazine rankedGladiator39th on its""100 Best Movies Of All Time"" list,and declared it the 22nd best film of the 21st century.[5][6]Thereview aggregatorRotten Tomatoesincluded the film on its list of ""140 Essential 2000s Movies"".[73]The character Maximus placed 95th onEmpire's list of 100 Greatest Movie Characters.[74]In 2025, it ranked number 92 onThe New York Times'list of ""The 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century.""[75]Historical accuracy[edit]Gladiatoris loosely based on real events that occurred within theRoman Empirein the latter half of the 2nd century AD. Scott intended to portray Roman culture more accurately than previous films, so he hired several historians as advisors. Nevertheless, multiple deviations from historical accuracy were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott later stated that public perception of ancient Rome, due to the influence of previous films, made some historical facts ""too unbelievable"" to include. For instance, in an early version of the script, gladiators endorsed products in the arena; while this would have been historically accurate, there was concern that audiences would think it anachronistic.[76]At least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits. Allen Ward, a historian at the University of Connecticut, believed that a higher level of historical accuracy would not have madeGladiatorless interesting or exciting. He asserted that filmmakers must be granted some artistic license when adapting historical events, but this license should not be employed to completely disregard facts.[77][78]Fictionalization[edit]Marcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus; he died atVindobona(modernVienna) in 180 AD from theAntonine Plague. The epidemic, believed to be eithersmallpoxormeasles, swept through the Roman Empire during his reign.[79]There is no indication that Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a republican form of government, as depicted in the film. Moreover, he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death. Commodus then ruled alone until his death in 192 AD.[80]The film depicts Marcus seizing victory in theMarcomannic Wars. In reality, the war was ongoing when he died. Commodus secured peace with the two Germanic tribes allied against Rome, theMarcomanniand theQuadi, immediately after his father's death.[81]The character Maximus is fictional, although in some respects he resemblesSpartacus, who led a slave revolt, andMarcus Nonius Macrinus, a general and friend of Marcus Aurelius.[82][83][84]Although Commodus engaged in show combat in the Colosseum, he was not killed in the arena; he was strangled in his bath by the wrestler Narcissus. Commodus reigned for over twelve years, unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film.[85]In the film, Lucilla is depicted as the widow of Lucius Verus. She has one son, also named Lucius Verus. In reality, Lucilla's son died long before the reign of Commodus, and she remarriedClaudius Pompeianussoon after Verus' death. She had been married to Claudius for 11 years by the time her brother became Emperor, and her only living son during this time was Aurelius Pompeianus.[86]The real-life Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in 182 AD, along with several others. She was first exiled to the island ofCapriby Commodus, then executed on his orders later in the year.[87]In the film, Marcus banned gladiatorial games in Rome. The real Aurelius, however, banned games only inAntioch. No games were ever banned in Rome.[88]It is implied that the death of Commodus did result in peace for Rome and a return to the Roman Republic. In reality, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in theYear of the Five Emperorsin AD 193, as shown in the second film. According to the historianHerodian, the Roman people were overjoyed at the news of Commodus' death, although they feared that the Praetorians would not accept the new emperorPertinax.[89]Anachronisms[edit]AlthoughGladiatortakes place in the 2nd century AD, theImperial Gallic armorand thehelmetsworn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. Thecenturions,cavalry,standard bearers, andauxiliarieswould have worn scale armor, known aslorica squamata.[90][91]The Praetorian Guards wear purple uniforms in the film, but this wardrobe is not corroborated by historical evidence. On campaign, they usually wore standard legionary equipment with some unique decorative elements.[92]GladiatordepictsGermanic tribesinaccurately wearing clothing from theStone Age.[93]The film shows the Roman cavalry usingstirrups. In reality, the cavalry used a two-horned saddle without stirrups. The stirrups were employed during filming because riding with a Roman saddle requires additional training and skill.[88]According to the classical scholar Martin Winkler,catapultsandballistaewould not have been used in a forest, as they were reserved primarily forsiegesand were rarely used in open battles. There is no documentation of the use of flaming arrows or flaming catapult canisters in ancient history.[88]Sequels[edit]Main article:Gladiator IIA sequel toGladiator, titledGladiator II, was released in November 2024.[94]The film is directed by Ridley Scott and written byDavid Scarpa. It starsPaul Mescal,Denzel Washington,Joseph Quinn,Fred Hechinger,Pedro Pascal, Connie Nielsen, and Derek Jacobi, the last two reprising their roles fromGladiator. It is produced byScott Free ProductionsforParamount Pictures. In addition to directing the film, Scott serves as a producer alongside Michael Pruss, Douglas Wick andLucy Fisher.[95]Costume designerJanty Yatesand production designer Arthur Max—both of whom worked onGladiator—returned for the sequel.[96]The story centers on Lucilla's son, Lucius, who is revealed to be the son of Maximus and not Lucius Verus as stated inGladiator.[97]InGladiator, Lucius is a young boy; inGladiator IIhe is a grown man.[98]A third film is in the works.[99][100][101]See also[edit]Films set in ancient RomePortal: Ancient RomeNotes[edit]^Subsequently titledThe Way of the Gladiator^Attributed to multiple references:[28][29][30]^Attributed to multiple references:[41][42][43]^Attributed to multiple references:[44][45][46]^Attributed to multiple references:[55][56][57]^Attributed to multiple references:[55][56][57][59][60][63]References[edit]Citations[edit]^""Gladiator – Cast, Crew, Director and Awards"".The New York Times. 2015.

The film also starsSophie Marceau,Patrick McGoohan,Catherine McCormackandAngus Macfadyen. The story is inspired byBlind Harry's 15th centuryepic poemThe Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallaceand was adapted for the screen byRandall Wallace.Development on the film initially started atMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) when producerAlan Ladd Jr.picked up the project from Wallace, but when MGM was going through new management, Ladd left the studio and took the project with him. Despite initially declining, Gibson eventually decided to direct the film and to star as Wallace. The film, which was produced by Gibson'sIcon ProductionsandThe Ladd Company, was distributed byParamount Picturesin the United States and Canada and by20th Century Foxin other countries.Released on May 24, 1995,Braveheartwas a critical and commercial success, receiving praise for its battle scenes, production design, musical score, and acting performances, though it received some criticism for its historical inaccuracies. The film also garnered numerous awards including theAcademy Award for Best Picture. Alegacy sequel,Robert the Bruce, was released in 2019.Plot[edit]In 1280,Edward I of England, known as ""Longshanks"", conquersScotlandfollowing the death of the Scots' king, who left no heir. YoungWilliam Wallacewitnesses the aftermath of Longshanks' execution of several Scottish nobles, then loses his father and brother when they resist the English. He leaves home to be raised by his uncle, Argyle. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, includingjus primae noctis, while hissonmarries French princessIsabelle. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns home and secretly marries his childhood friend Murron MacClannough. Soon after, Wallace rescues Murron from a soldier, but Murron is subsequently captured and executed. In retribution, Wallace and the locals overthrow the garrison, beginning a rebellion that soon spreads. Longshanks orders his son to stop Wallace while he campaigns in France. Wallace defeats an army sent by the prince atStirling, then invades England by sackingYork. He also meetsRobert the Bruce, a contender for the Scottish crown.After returning to England, Longshanks sends Isabelle to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction from the movement of Longshanks' forces. Meeting Wallace, Isabelle becomes enamored with him and warns him of Longshanks' plans. Wallace faces Longshanks atFalkirk. During the battle, nobles Mornay and Lochlan withdraw, having been bribed by Longshanks, resulting in Wallace's army being overwhelmed. Wallace also discovers Robert the Bruce had joined Longshanks. After helping Wallace escape, Robert vows to not be on the wrong side again. Wallace kills Mornay and Lochlan for their betrayal and foils an assassination plot with Isabelle's help. Wallace and Isabelle spend the following night together, while Longshanks' health declines. At a meeting inEdinburgh, Wallace is captured. Realizing his father's role in Wallace's betrayal, Robert disowns his father. In England, Wallace is condemned to execution. After a final meeting with Wallace, Isabelle tells Longshanks, who can no longer speak, that his bloodline will end upon his death as she is pregnant with Wallace's child and will ensure that Longshanks' son spends as short a time as possible as monarch. At his execution, Wallace refuses to submit, even while beingdisemboweled. The magistrate encourages Wallace to seek mercy and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, ""Freedom!"", while Longshanks dies. Before beingbeheaded, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd.In 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, faces the English atBannockburn, and implores his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. After Wallace's sword is thrown to land point-down in the ground, Robert leads the Scots to a final victory.Cast[edit]Mel GibsonasWilliam Wallace, a Scottish warrior who launched a rebellion against the English forcesSophie MarceauasPrincess Isabelle, crowned princess of France and wife to Prince EdwardPatrick McGoohanas KingLongshanks – King Edward I, aging and ruthless King of EnglandCatherine McCormackas Murron MacClannough, Wallace's childhood friend whom he married in secretAngus McFadyenasRobert the Bruce, a Scottish Nobleman who is the contender for the Scottish CrownBrendan Gleesonas Hamish, Wallace's childhood friendDavid O'Haraas Stephen, an Irish highlander who joins the rebellionIan BannenasThe Leper, Robert the Bruce's aging fatherJames Cosmoas Campbell, Hamish's father and a veteran warriorBrian Coxas Argyle Wallace, Wallace's unclePeter HanlyasPrince Edward, Longshanks' only son who is shown to be a weaklingAlun Armstrongas Mornay, a Scottish noble and cavalry commanderJohn Murtagh as Lochlan, a Scottish noble and cavalry commanderSeán McGinleyas Father MacClannough, Murron's father and the village enbalmer who joined Wallace's RebellionGerda Stevensonas Mother MacClannough, Murron's motherStephen Billingtonas Phillip, Prince Edward's adviserJohn Kavanaughas Craig, Robert the Bruce's adviserTommy Flanaganas Morrison, A Scotsman who joined Wallace's Rebellion after his wife was subject to Jus Primae NoctisRupert Vansittartas Lord Bottoms, a nobleman and overseer of Wallace's home villageTam Whiteas McGregor, a clan leader who rallied his clan to join Wallace's RebellionMichael Byrneas Smythe, a sadistic English officer stationed in Wallace's home villageMartin Murphy as Lord Talmadge, the English Commanding officer during the battle of Stirling Bridge based onJohn de WarenneGerard McSorleyas Cheltham, Talmadge's Second-in-Command based on SirHugh de CressinghamRichard Leafas Governor of YorkBernard Horsfallas Balliol, a Scottish noble vying for the Scottish CrownJimmy Chisholmas Faudron, an English assassin who infiltrated Wallace's campJeanne Marine as Nicolette, Isabella's handmaidenSean Lawloras Malcolm Wallace, William's father who was killed by the English when he was a childSandy Nelson as John Wallace, William's older brother who was killed by the English when he was a childProduction[edit]Development[edit]ProducerAlan Ladd Jr.initially had the project atMGM-Pathé Communicationswhen he picked up the script from Randall Wallace.[2]WhenMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer(MGM) was going through new management in 1993, Ladd left the studio and took some of its top properties, includingBraveheart.[3]Mel Gibson came across the script and even though he liked it, he initially passed on it. However, the thought of it kept coming back to him, and he ultimately decided to take on the project.[2]Terry Gilliamwas offered to direct the film, but he declined.[4]Gibson was initially interested in directing only and consideredBrad Pittin the role ofSir William Wallace, but later reluctantly agreed to play Wallace as well.[5]He also consideredJason Patricfor the role.[6]Sean Connerywas approached to play King Edward, but he declined due to other commitments.[7]Gibson said that Connery's pronunciation of ""Goulash"" helped him for the Scottish accent for the film.[8]Gibson and his production company,Icon Productions, had difficulty raising enough money for the film.Warner Bros.was willing to fund the project on the condition that Gibson sign for anotherLethal Weaponsequel, which he refused. Gibson eventually gained enough financing for the film, withParamount Picturesfinancing a third of the budget in exchange for North American distribution rights to the film, and20th Century Foxputting up the other two-thirds in exchange for foreign distribution rights.[9][5]Filming[edit]Gibson (right) on set with 20th Century Fox executiveScott NeesonFilming was initially due to take place fully in the United Kingdom, but most of the shoot was moved toIrelandat late notice after lobbying from the Irish government and their offer to supply 1,600 members of theIrish Army Reserveas extras. Shooting was planned to take 12 weeks on location in Ireland and atArdmore Studios, plus five weeks on location in Scotland.[10]Principal photography on the film took place between June 6, 1994, and October 28, 1994.[11]To lower costs, Gibson had the same extras portray both armies. The reservists had been given permission to grow beards and swapped their military uniforms for medieval garb.[12]The film was shot in theanamorphic formatwithPanavisionC- and E-Series lenses.[13]Gibson also later said that while filming a battle scene a horse nearly ""killed him"" but his stunt double was able to save him as the horse fell.[14]Gibson had to tone down the film's battle scenes to avoid anNC-17rating from theMPAA; the final version was rated R for ""brutalmedieval warfare"".[15]Gibson and editorSteven Rosenbluminitially had a film at 195 minutes, butSherry Lansing, who was the head of Paramount at the time, requested Gibson and Rosenblum to cut the film down to 177 minutes.[16]According to Gibson in a 2016 interview withCollider, there is a four-hour version of the film, and he expressed interest in reassembling it if both Paramount and Fox were interested.[17]Soundtrack[edit]Main article:Braveheart (soundtrack)The score was composed and conducted byJames Hornerand performed by theLondon Symphony Orchestra. It is Horner's second of three collaborations withMel Gibsonas director. The score has gone on to be one of the most commercially successful soundtracks of all time. It received considerable acclaim from film critics and audiences and was nominated for a number of awards, including theAcademy Award,Saturn Award,BAFTA Award, andGolden Globe Award.Release[edit]Braveheartpremiered at theSeattle International Film Festivalon May 18, 1995, and received its wide release in U.S. cinemas six days later.[18][19]Home media[edit]Braveheartwas released onLaserDiscin bothpan and scanandwidescreenon March 12, 1996. That same day, it also was made available onVHSin pan and scan only and was re-issued in widescreen on August 27.The film was released onDVDon August 29, 2000.

The website's consensus reads: ""Distractingly violent and historically dodgy, Mel Gibson'sBraveheartjustifies its epic length by delivering enough sweeping action, drama, and romance to match its ambition.""[24]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating ""generally favorable"" reviews.[25]Gibson's work onBraveheartearned him theAcademy Award for Best Director.Caryn JamesofThe New York Timespraised the film, calling it ""one of the most spectacular entertainments in years.""[26]Roger Ebertgave the film three and a half out of four stars, calling it ""An action epic with the spirit of the Hollywood swordplay classics and the grungy ferocity ofThe Road Warrior.""[27]In a positive review,Gene Siskelwrote that ""in addition to staging battle scenes well, Gibson also manages to recreate the filth and mood of 700 years ago.""[28]Peter TraversofRolling Stonefelt that ""though the film dawdles a bit with the shimmery, dappled love stuff involving Wallace with a Scottish peasant and a French princess, the action will pin you to your seat.""[29]The depiction of theBattle of Stirlingwas listed byCNNas one of the best battles in cinema history.[30]Not all reviews were positive.Richard SchickelofTimemagazine argued that ""everybody knows that a non-blubbering clause is standard in all movie stars' contracts. Too bad there isn't one banning self-indulgence when they direct.""[31]Peter Stack of theSan Francisco Chroniclefelt ""at times the film seems an obsessive ode to Mel Gibson machismo.""[32]In a 2005 poll by British film magazineEmpire,Braveheartwas No. 1 on their list of ""The Top 10 Worst Pictures to Win Best Picture Oscar"".[33]Empirereaders had previously votedBraveheartthe best film of 1995.[34]Alex von Tunzelmann ofThe Guardiangave the film a grade of C−, saying: ""Seemingly intended as a piece of anti-English propaganda,Braveheartoffers an even greater insult to Scotland by making a total pig's ear of its heritage. ""Historians from England will say I am a liar,"" intones the voiceover, ""but history is written by those who have hanged heroes."" Well, that's me told: but, regardless of whether you read English or Scottish historians on the matter,Braveheartstill serves up a great big steaming haggis of lies.""[35]In a 2012 article, Nathan Kamal called the film ""hugely overrated"", criticizing the characters as one-dimensional.[36]Effect on tourism[edit]The European premiere was on September 3, 1995, inStirling.[37]In 1996, the year after the film was released, the annual three-day ""Braveheart Conference"" atStirling Castleattracted fans ofBraveheart, increasing the conference's attendance to 167,000 from 66,000 in the previous year.[38]In the following year, research on visitors to the Stirling area indicated that 55% of the visitors had seenBraveheart. Of visitors from outside Scotland, 15% of those who sawBraveheartsaid it influenced their decision to visit the country. Of all visitors who sawBraveheart, 39% said the film influenced in part their decision to visit Stirling, and 19% said the film was one of the main reasons for their visit.[39]In the same year, a tourism report said that the ""Bravehearteffect"" earned Scotland £7 million to £15 million in tourist revenue, and the report led to various national organizations encouraging international film productions to take place in Scotland.[40]The film generated huge interest in Scotland and inScottish history, not only around the world, but also in Scotland itself.[citation needed]At aBraveheartConvention in 1997, held in Stirling the day after theScottish Devolutionvote and attended by 200 delegates from around the world,Braveheartauthor Randall Wallace, Seoras Wallace of the Wallace Clan, Scottish historian David Ross and Bláithín FitzGerald from Ireland gave lectures on various aspects of the film.[citation needed]Several of the actors also attended including James Robinson (Young William), Andrew Weir (Young Hamish), Julie Austin (the young bride) and Mhairi Calvey (Young Murron).[citation needed]Awards and honors[edit]Braveheartwas nominated for many awards during the 1995 awards season, though it was not viewed by many[who?]as a major competitor to films such asApollo 13,Il Postino: The Postman,Leaving Las Vegas,Sense and Sensibility, andThe Usual Suspects.[41]It wasn't until after the film won theGolden Globe Award for Best Directorat the53rd Golden Globe Awardsthat it was viewed as a serious Oscar contender.[41]When the nominations were announced for the68th Academy Awards,Braveheartreceived ten Academy Award nominations, and a month later, won five includingBest Picture,Best Directorfor Gibson,Best Cinematography,Best Sound Effects Editing, andBest Makeup.[42]Braveheartbecame the ninth film to win Best Picture with no acting nominations and is one of only four films to win Best Picture without being nominated for theScreen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, the others beingThe Shape of Waterin 2017,Green Bookin 2018, andNomadlandin 2020.[43][44][45]The film also won theWriters Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay.[46]In 2010, theIndependent Film & Television Allianceselected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.[47]AwardCategoryRecipient(s)Result20/20 AwardsBest CinematographyJohn TollNominatedBest Costume DesignCharles KnodeNominatedBest MakeupPeter Frampton,Paul PattisonandLois BurwellWonBest Original ScoreJames HornerNominatedBest SoundNominatedAcademy AwardsBest PictureMel Gibson,Bruce DaveyandAlan Ladd Jr.WonBest DirectorMel GibsonWonBest Screenplay – Written Directly for the ScreenRandall WallaceNominatedBest CinematographyJohn TollWonBest Costume DesignCharles KnodeNominatedBest Film EditingSteven RosenblumNominatedBest MakeupPeter Frampton, Paul Pattison and Lois BurwellWonBest Original Dramatic ScoreJames HornerNominatedBest SoundAndy Nelson,Scott Millan,Anna BehlmerandBrian SimmonsNominatedBest Sound Effects EditingLon BenderandPer HallbergWonAmerican Cinema Editors AwardsBest Edited Feature FilmSteven RosenblumWonAmerican Cinema Foundation AwardsFeature FilmWonAmerican Society of Cinematographers AwardsOutstanding Achievement in Cinematography in Theatrical ReleasesJohn TollWonAwards Circuit Community AwardsBest DirectorMel GibsonNominatedBest Original ScreenplayRandall WallaceNominatedBest Art DirectionThomas E.

It's a xenophobic film.""[53]Ian Burrell ofThe Independenthas said, ""TheBraveheartphenomenon, a Hollywood-inspired rise inScottish nationalism, has been linked to a rise in anti-English prejudice"".[55]Wallace Monument[edit]Tom Church's controversial statue of Gibson as WallaceIn 1997, a 12-foot (3.7 m), 13-tonne (13-long-ton; 14-short-ton)sandstonestatue depicting Mel Gibson as William Wallace inBraveheartwas placed in the car park of theWallace MonumentnearStirling, Scotland. The statue, which was the work of Tom Church, amonumental masonfromBrechin,[56]included the word 'Braveheart' on Wallace's shield. The installation became the cause of much controversy; one local resident stated that it was wrong to ""desecrate the main memorial to Wallace with a lump of crap"".[57]In 1998, someone wielding a hammer vandalized the statue's face. After repairs were made, the statue was encased in a cage every night to prevent further vandalism. This only incited more calls for the statue to be removed, as it then appeared that the Gibson/Wallace figure was imprisoned. The statue was described as ""among the most loathed pieces of public art in Scotland"".[58]In 2008, the statue was returned to its sculptor to make room for a new visitor centre being built at the foot of the Wallace Monument.[59]Historical inaccuracy[edit]Randall Wallace, who wrote the screenplay, has acknowledgedBlind Harry's 15th-centuryepic poemThe Acts and Deeds of Sir William Wallace, Knight of Elderslieas a major inspiration for the film.[60]In defending his script, Randall Wallace has said, ""Is Blind Harry true? I don't know. I know that it spoke to my heart and that's what matters to me, that it spoke to my heart.""[60]Blind Harry's poem is not regarded as historically accurate, and although some incidents in the film that are not historically accurate are taken from Blind Harry (e.g. thehanging of Scottish noblesat the start),[61]there are large parts that are based neither on history nor Blind Harry (e.g. Wallace's affair with Princess Isabella).[62]The reign ofKing Edward I of Englandis one of the most well documented by contemporary chroniclers in the Middle Ages, these sources were entirely ignored by the screenwriter in favour of the non contemporary source written more than two centuries after the events it pretends to portray.Elizabeth Ewan describesBraveheartas a film that ""almost totally sacrifices historical accuracy for epic adventure"".[63]It has been described as one of the most historically inaccurate modern films.[62][64]Sharon Krossa noted that the film contains numerous historical inaccuracies, beginning with the wearing ofbelted plaid(feileadh mór léine), which was not introduced until the 16th century,[65]by Wallace and his men. In that period ""no Scots [...] wore belted plaids (let alonekiltsof any kind)."" Moreover, when Highlanders finally did begin wearing the belted plaid, it was not ""in the rather bizarre style depicted in the film"". She compares the inaccuracy to ""a film about Colonial America showing the colonial men wearing 20th-century business suits, but with the jackets worn back-to-front instead of the right way around.""[66]In a previous essay about the film, she wrote, ""The events aren't accurate, the dates aren't accurate, the characters aren't accurate, the names aren't accurate, the clothes aren't accurate—in short, just about nothing is accurate.""[67]Peter Traquair has referred to Wallace's ""farcical representation as a wild and hairy highlander painted withwoad(1,000 years too late) running amok in atartankilt (500 years too early).""[68]Caroline White ofThe Timesdescribed the film as being made up of a ""litany of fibs.""[69]Irish historian Seán Duffy remarked that ""thebattle of Stirling Bridgecould have done with a bridge.""[70]In 2009, the film was second on a list of ""most historically inaccurate movies"" inThe Times.[62]In the humorous non-fictional historiographyAn Utterly Impartial History of Britain(2007), authorJohn O'Farrellclaims thatBraveheartcould not have been more historically inaccurate, even if aPlasticinedog had been inserted in the film and the title changed to ""WilliamWallace and Gromit"".[71]In theDVDaudio commentaryofBraveheart, Mel Gibson acknowledged the historical inaccuracies but defended his choices as director, noting that the way events were portrayed in the film was much more ""cinematically compelling"" than the historical fact or conventional mythos.[62]Jus primae noctis[edit]Edward Longshanksis shown invokingJus primae noctisin the film, allowing the lord of a medieval estate to take the virginity of his serfs' maiden daughters on their wedding nights. Critical medieval scholarship regards this supposed right as a myth: ""the simple reason why we are dealing with a myth here rests in the surprising fact that practically all writers who make any such claims have never been able or willing to cite any trustworthy source, if they have any.""[72][73]Occupation and independence[edit]The film suggests Scotland had been under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace's childhood, and in the run-up to theBattle of FalkirkWallace says to the younger Bruce, ""[W]e'll have what none of us have ever had before, a country of our own."" In fact, Scotland had beeninvaded by Englandonly the year before Wallace's rebellion; before the death ofKing Alexander IIIit had been a fully separate kingdom.[74]ScriptwriterRandall Wallaceputs the words “hundred years of theft, rape, and murder” into the mouth ofWilliam Wallacewhich entirely misunderstands the relationship betweenEnglandandScotlandin thethirteenth century. The sister ofKing Edward I of England,Margaret of Englandwas married toAlexander III of Scotland. They had been married atYork Minsterin 1251 amidst friendly relations between the two royal families. As Robert Bartlett wrote “ In fact, in the hundred years before 1297, the year of that battle [of Dunbar], the king of England had led an army into Scotland only once, for ten days in January 1216.”[75]Portrayal of William Wallace[edit]AsJohn Shelton Lawrenceand Robert Jewett writes, ""Because [William] Wallace is one of Scotland's most important national heroes and because he lived in the very distant past, much that is believed about him is probably the stuff of legend. But there is a factual strand that historians agree to"", summarized from Scots scholar Matt Ewart:Wallace was born into the gentry of Scotland; his father lived until he was 18, his mother until his 24th year; he killed the sheriff ofLanarkwhen he was 27, apparently after the murder of his wife; he led a group of commoners against the English in a very successful battle at Stirling in 1297, temporarily receiving appointment asguardian; Wallace's reputation as a military leader was ruined in the same year of 1297, leading to his resignation as guardian; he spent several years of exile in France before being captured by the English atGlasgow, this resulting in his trial for treason and his cruel execution.[76]A. E. Christa Canitz writes about the historical William Wallace further: ""[He] was a younger son of the Scottish gentry, usually accompanied by his own chaplain, well-educated, and eventually, having been appointedGuardian of the Kingdom of Scotland, engaged in diplomatic correspondence with theHanseatic citiesofLübeckandHamburg"". She finds that inBraveheart, ""any hint of his descent from the lowland gentry (i.e., the lesser nobility) is erased, and he is presented as an economically and politically marginalized Highlander and 'a farmer'—as one with the common peasant, and with a strong spiritual connection to the land which he is destined to liberate.""[77]Colin McArthur writes thatBraveheart""constructs Wallace as a kind of modern,nationalistguerrillaleader in a period half a millennium before the appearance of nationalism on the historical stage as a concept under which disparate classes and interests might be mobilised within a nation state."" Writing aboutBraveheart's ""omissions of verified historical facts"", McArthur notes that Wallace made ""overtures toEdward Iseeking less severe treatment after his defeat at Falkirk"", as well as ""the well-documented fact of Wallace's having resorted toconscriptionand his willingness to hang those who refused to serve.""[78]Canitz posits that depicting ""such lack of class solidarity"" as the conscriptions and related hangings ""would contaminate the movie's image of Wallace as the morally irreproachableprimus inter paresamong his peasant fighters.""[77]Portrayal of Isabella of France[edit]Isabella of Franceis shown spending a night with Wallace after theBattle of Falkirk. She later tells Edward I she is pregnant with Wallace's child, implied to beEdward III. In reality, Isabella was a child and living in France at the time of the Battle of Falkirk, was not married to Edward II until he was already king, and Edward III was born seven years after Wallace's execution in 1305.[79][62]The breakdown of the couple's relationship over his liaisons, and the menacing suggestion to a dying Longshanks that she would overthrow and destroy Edward II mirror and foreshadow actual facts; although not until 1326, over 20 years after Wallace's death, Isabella and her loverRoger Mortimerwould depose – and later allegedly murder – Edward II.[80]Portrayal of Robert the Bruce[edit]Robert the Brucedid change sides between the Scots loyalists and theEnglishmore than once in the earlier stages of theWars of Scottish Independence, but he probably did not fight on the English side at theBattle of Falkirk(although this claim does appear in a few medieval sources).[81]Later, theBattle of Bannockburnwas not a spontaneous battle soon after Wallace's execution; he had already been fighting a guerrilla campaign against the English for eight years.[82]His title before becoming king wasEarl of Carrick, not Earl of Bruce.[83][84]Bruce's fatheris portrayed as an infirmleper, although it was Bruce himself who allegedly suffered from leprosy in later life. The actual Bruce's machinations around Wallace, rather than the meek idealist in the film, suggests the father–son relationship represent different aspects of the historical Bruce's character.[85][86]In the film, Bruce's father betrays Wallace to his son's disgust, calling it the price of his son's crown, when in real life Wallace was betrayed by the noblemanJohn de Menteith.[87]Portrayal of Longshanks and Prince Edward[edit]The actualEdward Iwas ruthless and temperamental, but the film exaggerates his negative aspects for effect. Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wifeEleanor of Castile, and as a religious man, he gave generously to charity; the film's scene where he scoffs cynically at Isabella for distributing gold to the poor after Wallace refuses it as a bribe would have been unlikely. Furthermore, Edward died almost two years after Wallace's execution, not on the same day.[88]The depiction of the futureEdward IIas aneffeminatehomosexual drew accusations ofhomophobiaagainst Gibson.We cut a scene out, unfortunately ... where you really got to know that character [Edward II] and to understand his plight and his pain ... But it just stopped the film in the first act so much that you thought, 'When's this story going to start?'[89]Gibson defended his depiction of Prince Edward as weak and ineffectual, saying:I'm just trying to respond to history. You can cite other examples—Alexander the Great, for example, who conquered the entire world, was also a homosexual. But this story isn't about Alexander the Great. It's about Edward II.[90]In response to Longshanks's murder of the prince's lover, Phillip, Gibson replied: ""The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody.""[91]Gibson asserted, without evidence, that the reason Longshanks kills his son's lover is that the king is a ""psychopath"".[92]Wallace's military campaign[edit]""MacGregors from the nextglen"" joining Wallace shortly after theaction at Lanarkis dubious, since it is questionable whetherClan Gregorexisted at that stage, and when they did emerge their traditional home wasGlen Orchy, some distance from Lanark.[93]Wallace did win an important victory at theBattle of Stirling Bridge, but the version inBraveheartis highly inaccurate, as it has no bridge (orAndrew Moray, joint commander of the Scots army, who was fatally injured in the battle). Later, Wallace did carry out a large-scale raid into the north of England, but he did not get as far south as York, nor did he kill Edward I's nephew.[94]The ""Irish conscripts"" at theBattle of Falkirkare unhistorical; there were no Irish troops at Falkirk (although many of the English army were, in fact,Welsh).[95]The two-handed long swords used by Gibson in the film were not in wide use in the period. A one-handed sword and shield would have been more accurate and more efficient, since in the enemy army there were a lot of archers.[96][better source needed]Sequel[edit]Main article:Robert the Bruce (film)A sequel,Robert the Bruce(2019), continues directly on fromBraveheartand features Robert the Bruce, with Angus Macfadyen reprising his role fromBraveheart.[97]See also[edit]Outlaw King, which depicts events that occurred immediately after the events inBraveheartRob Roy, a historical action drama film featuring Robert Roy MacGregor, an 18th-century Scottish clan chief, also released in 1995Pàtria, an independent film fromCatalonia, depicting the Catalan national heroOtger Cataló's fight to liberate Catalonia from theMoorsReferences[edit]^""Braveheart (1995)"".British Film Institute.

When both sides realize the situation, Sullivan and Costigan each attempt to discover the other's identity before they are found out.The Departedwas a critical and commercial success, grossing $291.5 million on a budget of around $90 million and receiving acclaim for its direction, performances (particularly of DiCaprio, Nicholson, and Wahlberg), screenplay,[10]and editing.[11]It wonseveral accolades, including fourOscarsat the79th Academy Awards: forBest Picture,Best Directorfor Scorsese (his only personal Oscar win to date),Best Adapted Screenplayfor Monahan, andBest Film Editingfor editorThelma Schoonmaker.[12]The film also received six nominations each at the64th Golden Globe Awards(winning one) and the60th British Academy Film Awards, and two nominations at the13th Screen Actors Guild Awards.Plot[edit]In the 1980s inBoston,Irish Mobboss Frank Costello introduces himself to a young Colin Sullivan. Many years later, Sullivan has been groomed as aspyinside theMassachusetts State Police(MSP) and joins the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). Another police academy recruit, Billy Costigan, is selected by Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignamto go undercoveras a criminal and infiltrate Costello's crew.Costigan serves a term in prison for his cover and further commits several crimes, drawing Costello's attention. Sullivan begins dating police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan manages to get Costello to recruit him into his organization. Over the next year, Costigan becomes increasingly involved. His mental state declines but Queenan and Dignam convince him to continue. Costigan begins seeing Madden for his court-ordered therapy.The MSP and Costello both realize they have moles in their respective organizations and task Costigan and Sullivan to find them. Meanwhile, Costigan learns that Costello is a protectedFBIinformant, sharing his discovery with Queenan. He and Madden have an affair.One night, Costigan follows Costello into anadult theaterand witnesses him giving Sullivan an envelope containing information on his crew. Costigan is instructed to get a visual ID of Sullivan but is unsuccessful. When Sullivan realizes he is being followed, he stabs a man, mistaking him for Costigan, and flees. Costigan, fearing Costello will soon discover and kill him for being the mole, calls Queenan to end the undercover operation, but Sullivan has Queenan followed, lying to the other officers that Queenan may be the spy. Sullivan also calls Costello's gang to inform them of the meeting.When Costello's men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before being thrown from the building to his death. This causes a firefight between the police and Costello's men. Angered by Queenan's murder, Dignam attacks Sullivan and is suspended. Timothy Delahunt, one of Costello's henchmen wounded in the gunfight, tells Costigan that he knows he is the mole before succumbing to his wounds.Looking through Queenan's belongings, Sullivan discovers Costello is an FBI informant. A news report reveals that Delahunt was aBoston Police Departmentundercover officer, but Costello suspects it is a false claim so he would stop looking for the mole. Deciding to turn on him, Sullivan directs the MSP to tail Costello, and a gunfight erupts, killing most of Costello's crew. Sullivan confronts a wounded Costello, who admits to being an FBI informant. They exchange gunfire, and Sullivan kills him.His assignment finished, Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status, unaware he is another mole. After Sullivan leaves the room, Costigan recognises the envelope from the theater on his desk. Realizing Sullivan was Costello's mole, Costigan escapes.When Sullivan finds Costigan gone, he realizes Costigan has discovered the truth and deletes Costigan's records from police computers. Costigan visits Madden, who has told Sullivan but not Costigan she's pregnant, knowing that Sullivan may not be the father, and hands her an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him.Madden finds an envelope in the mail from Costigan to Sullivan containing a CD of Costello's recorded conversations with Sullivan. Fearing Costigan has revealed their affair, she listens to it and leaves Sullivan. Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the same rooftop where Queenan was killed, then arrests him. Costigan calls Trooper Brown, an acquaintance from the police academy, but Brown pulls a gun on him when he arrives, unsure who to believe.Saying he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, Brown lets Costigan take the elevator. Upon reaching the lobby, Costigan is shot dead by Trooper Barrigan, a friend of Sullivan's who is another of Costello's spies. Brown reaches the lobby but is also killed by Barrigan. Sullivan shoots Barrigan dead, so that he can frame him as the only mole.At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices Madden silently crying. He realizes they were involved, but when he attempts to talk to her about the baby, she ignores him. Later, when Sullivan arrives home, Dignam is waiting for him and, after Sullivan indifferently accepts his fate, Dignam shoots him in the head, killing him and avenging both Queenan and Costigan before leaving. The final shot shows a rat crawling on the rail of the patio with theMassachusetts State Housein the distance.Cast[edit]Leonardo DiCaprioas Trooper William ""Billy"" Costigan Jr.Matt Damonas Staff Sergeant Colin SullivanJack Nicholsonas Francis ""Frank"" CostelloMark Wahlbergas Staff Sergeant Sean DignamMartin Sheenas Captain Oliver ""Charlie"" QueenanRay Winstoneas Arnold ""Frenchie"" FrenchVera Farmigaas Dr. Madolyn MaddenAlec Baldwinas Captain George EllerbyAnthony Andersonas Trooper BrownKevin Corriganas Sean CostiganJames Badge Daleas Trooper BarriganDavid O'Haraas Patrick ""Fitzy"" FitzgibbonsMark Rolstonas Timothy DelahuntRobert Wahlbergas FBI Special Agent Frank LazioAmanda Lynch as CarmenKristen Daltonas GwenShay Duffinas PhilProduction[edit]Martin Scorsese, the director of the film, in 2010In January 2003,Warner Bros. Pictures, and producersBrad GreyandBrad Pittbought the rights to remake the Hong Kong filmInfernal Affairs(2002) fromMedia Asia Entertainment Groupfor $1.75 million.[13][14]William Monahanwas secured as a screenwriter, and laterMartin Scorsese, who admired Monahan's script, came on board as director.[14][8][15]In March 2004,United Press Internationalannounced that Scorsese would be remakingInfernal Affairsand setting it in Boston, and that Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were slated to star.[16]Pitt, tentatively scheduled to play Sullivan, later declined to play the role, saying a younger actor should play the part; he decided to produce the film instead.[15]Scorsese's associateKenneth Lonergansuggested Matt Damon, who grew up in Boston, for the part of Sullivan, and Scorsese asked Jack Nicholson to play Costello.[8]Robert De Nirowas approached to play Queenan, but De Niro declined in order to directThe Good Shepherdinstead.[17]Scorsese would later say that De Niro turned down the role as he was not interested.[18]Ray Liottawas approached for a role in the film, but declined due to a commitment to another project.[19]Nicholson wanted the film to have ""something a little more"" than the usual gangster film, and screenwriter Monahan came up with the idea of basing the Costello character on Irish-American gangsterWhitey Bulger. This gave the screenplay an element of realism—and an element of dangerous uncertainty, because of the wide-rangingcarte blanchethe FBI gave Bulger in exchange for revealing information about fellow gangsters.[8]A technical consultant on the film was Tom Duffy, who had served three decades on the Boston Police Department, particularly as an undercover detective investigating the Irish mob.[20][21]The Departedwas officially greenlit by Warner Bros. in early 2005 and shooting began on April 18th of that year.[14]Some of the film was shot on location in Boston. For budgetary and logistical reasons many scenes, in particular interiors, were shot in locations and sets in New York City, which had tax incentives for filmmakers that Boston at the time did not.[8][22]Warner Bros. acquired worldwide distribution rights to the film excluding the U.K., Ireland, France, Italy, the CIS and Chinese-speaking territories, IEG held onto the U.K., Ireland, France and Italy while Media Asia Films held onto the film in Chinese-speaking territories, IEG sold the film toEntertainment Film Distributorsin the U.K. and Ireland,TFM Distribution[fr]in France, andMedusa Filmin Italy.Themes and motifs[edit]Film criticStanley Kauffmannsaid that forThe Departed,Scorsese ""was apparently concerned with the idea of identity, one of the ancient themes of drama, and how it affects one's actions, emotions, self-knowledge, even dreams."" Kauffmann, however, did not find the theme conveyed with particular effectiveness in the film.[23]Film criticRoger Ebertcompared Costigan and Sullivan's seeking of approval from those they are deceiving toStockholm syndrome.[24]Ebert also noted the themes ofCatholic guilt.[24]In the final scene, a rat is seen on Sullivan's window ledge. Scorsese acknowledges that while it is not meant to be taken literally, it somewhat symbolizes the ""quest for the rat"" in the film and the strong sense of distrust among the characters, much like post-9/11U.S. The window view behind the rat is a nod to gangster films likeLittle Caesar(1931),Scarface(1932), andWhite Heat(1949).[25]The film's penultimate scene at Costigan's funeral, when Madden walks straight past Sullivan and out of camera without looking at him, is a visual quotation of the closing scene fromThe Third Man.Throughout the film, Scorsese uses an ""X"" motif to foreshadow death in a manner similar toHoward Hawks' filmScarface(1932). Examples include shots of cross-beam supports in an airport walkway when Costigan is phoning Sgt. Dignam, the lighted ""X"" on the wall in Sullivan's office when he assures Costello over the phone that Costigan is not the rat, the taped windows of the building Queenan enters before being thrown to his death, behind Costigan's head in the elevator before he is shot, and the carpeted hallway floor when Sullivan returns to his apartment before being shot by Dignam at the film's end.[26]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]The Departedgrossed $132.4 million in the United States and Canada and $159 million in other territories for a total gross of $291.5 million, against a production budget of $90 million.[2]The film grossed $26.9 million in its opening weekend, becoming the fourth Scorsese film to debut at number one.[27]It is the last Best Picture winner to debut atop the box office. In the following three weeks the film grossed $19 million, $13.5 million and $9.8 million, finishing second at the box office each time, before grossing $7.7 million and dropping to 5th in its fifth week.[28]Critical response[edit]As per thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 91% of critics have givenThe Departeda positive review based on 286 reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The site's critics consensus reads, ""Featuring outstanding work from an excellent cast,The Departedis a thoroughly engrossing gangster drama with the gritty authenticity and soupy morality we have come to expect from Martin Scorsese.""[29]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 85 out of 100, with 92% positive reviews based on 39 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[30]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.[31]Entertainment Weeklyranked it on its end-of-the-decade ""Best of"" list, saying: ""If they're lucky, directors make one classic film in their career. Martin Scorsese has one per decade (Taxi Driverin the '70s,Raging Bullin the '80s,Goodfellasin the '90s). His 2006 Irish Mafia masterpiece kept the streak alive.""[32]Roger Ebertgave the film four stars out of four, praising Scorsese for thematically differentiating his film from the original.[24]Online criticJames Berardinelliawarded the film four stars out of four, praising it as ""an American epic tragedy."" He went on to claim that the film deserves to be ranked alongside Scorsese's past successes, includingTaxi Driver,Raging BullandGoodfellas.[33]Andrew Lau, co-director ofInfernal Affairs, in an interview with Hong Kong newspaperApple Daily, said: ""Of course I think the version I made is better, but the Hollywood version is pretty good too. [Scorsese] made the Hollywood version more attuned to American culture.""[34]Andy Lau, one of the main actors inInfernal Affairs, when asked how the movie compares to the original, said: ""The Departedwas too long and it felt as if Hollywood had combined all threeInfernal Affairsmovies together.""[35]Although Lau said the script of the remake had some ""golden quotes,"" he also felt it had a bit too much profanity. He ultimately ratedThe Departedeight out of ten and said that the Hollywood remake is worth a view, though according to Lau's spokeswoman Alice Tam, he felt that the combination of the two female characters into one inThe Departedwas not as good as the original storyline.[36]A few critics were disappointed in the film, includingJ. Hobermanof theVillage Voice, who wrote: ""Infernal Affairswas surprisingly cool and effectively restrained for HK action, but Scorsese raises the temperature with every ultraviolent interaction. The surplus of belligerence and slur reach near-Tarantinianlevels—appropriate as he's staking a claim to QT's turf.""[37]Top ten lists[edit]The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2006.[38]Carrie Rickey ofThe Philadelphia Inquirer, Joe Morgenstern ofThe Wall Street Journal, Ruthe Stein of theSan Francisco Chronicle, and Steven Rea ofThe Philadelphia Inquirernamed it one of the top ten films of 2006.[38]Richard Roeper of theChicago Sun-Timesnamed it the best film of the 2000s.[39]1st –Richard Roeper,Ebert and Roeper1st –Peter Travers,Rolling Stone1st – Rene Rodriguez,The Miami Herald1st – Scott Tobias,The A.V.

E. Smith, Larry Saltzman andMarc Ribot.[50]The score was recorded in Shore's own studio inNew York State. The album,The Departed: Original Score, was released December 5, 2006 byNew Line, and produced by Jason Cienkus.[51]Scorsese described the music as ""a very dangerous and lethal tango"" and cited the guitar-based score ofMurder by Contractand thezitherinThe Third Manas inspiration.[52]The film also quotes significantly from Donizetti's operaLucia di Lammermoor. Frank Costello is seen listening to the famous sextet from Act 2 of the opera, and  has its theme as his phone ringtone.Canceled sequel[edit]Although many of the key characters in the film are dead by the end, there was a script written for a sequel. This was ultimately shelved due to the expense and Scorsese's lack of interest in creating a sequel.[53]See also[edit]""The Debarted"", an episode ofThe Simpsonsthat parodies the filmList of American films of 2006List of films that most frequently use the word fuckReferences[edit]^ab""The Departed"".AFI Catalog.American Film Institute.

The film also starsKelly Macdonaldas Moss's wife, Carla Jean, andWoody Harrelsonas Carson Wells, a bounty hunter seeking Moss and the return of the money, $2 million.No Country for Old Menpremiered in competition at the2007 Cannes Film Festivalon May 19.[6]The film became a commercial success, grossing $171 million worldwide against a budget of $25 million. Critics praised the Coens' direction and screenplay and Bardem's performance, and the film won76 awards from 109 nominationsfrom multiple organizations; it won four awards at the80th Academy Awards(includingBest Picture), threeBritish Academy Film Awards(BAFTAs), and twoGolden Globes.[7]TheAmerican Film Institutelisted it as an AFI Movie of the Year,[8]and theNational Board of Reviewselected it as the best of 2007.[9]It is one of only four Western films ever to win the Academy Award for Best Picture (the others beingCimarronin 1931,Dances with Wolvesin 1990, andUnforgivenin 1992).No Country for Old Menwas considered one of the best films of 2007,[10]and many regard it as the Coen brothers'magnum opus.[11][12][13][14]As of December 2021[update], various sources had recognized it as one of the best films of the 2000s.[15][16][17][18][19]The Guardian's John Patterson wrote: ""the Coens' technical abilities, and their feel for a landscape-based Western classicism reminiscent ofAnthony MannandSam Peckinpah, are matched by few living directors"",[20]andPeter TraversofRolling Stonesaid that it is ""a new career peak for the Coen brothers"" and ""as entertaining as hell"".[21]In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United StatesNational Film Registryby theLibrary of Congressas being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".[22][23]Plot[edit]In 1980, hitmanAnton Chigurhis arrested in Texas. He escapes by strangling the sheriff's deputy and steals a car by killing the driver with acaptive bolt pistol. Later, he spares the life of agas stationowner for correctly calling acoin toss.Meanwhile, Llewelyn Moss is huntingpronghornsin the desert. He comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, finding several dead men, a wounded Mexican man begging for water, drugs in a truck, and a briefcase containing $2 million in cash. He takes the briefcase and returns home. Feeling guilty, he returns with water that night but finds the man has been murdered. He looks up to the ridge and sees two men with guns who pursue him in a truck. He escapes by diving into a river. After making his way back home, Moss sends his wife, Carla Jean, to stay with her mother.Chigurh is hired to recover the missing money; meanwhile,Terrell CountySheriff Ed Tom Bell begins investigating the failed drug deal. Chigurh searches Moss' trailer home, using his bolt pistol to blow out the door lock. Moss takes a taxi to a motel inDel Rio, where he hides the briefcase in his room's air duct. After Moss returns to the motel after purchasing new boots, he sees the curtains in his room in a different position from when he left, and rightly assumes he has been found. Following a tracking device hidden in the case, Chigurh goes to Moss' motel and kills three Mexican mobsters who were waiting for Moss in his room. Moss has rented a second room adjacent to the Mexicans' room with access to the duct where the money is hidden. He retrieves the briefcase before Chigurh opens the duct.Moving to a hotel in the border town ofEagle Pass, Moss discovers the tracking device, but Chigurh has already found him. Their firefight spills onto the streets, badly wounding both and killing a truck driver. Moss flees to Mexico, hiding the case along theRio Grande. Chigurh cleans and stitches his wounds with stolen supplies. Carson Wells, abounty hunter, visits a wounded Moss in a Mexican hospital, and offers protection from Chigurh in exchange for the money, but Moss refuses. Chigurh ambushes Wells at his hotel. The phone rings as Wells is bartering for his life. Chigurh shoots him and takes the call from Moss, vowing to kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money.Moss retrieves the case from the Rio Grande and arranges to meet Carla Jean at a motel inEl Paso, where he plans to give her the money and hide her from danger. Carla Jean's mother unknowingly reveals Moss' location to a group of Mexicans tailing them. Bell reaches the motel in El Paso, only to find that the Mexicans have killed Moss. Carla Jean arrives later and weeps when Bell somberly removes his hat.That night, Bell returns to the crime scene and sees the lock blown out. Chigurh appears to be on the other side of the door holding his shotgun. Bell hesitantly enters and finds the room empty, and notices that the room's air duct has been opened. Bell visits his cousin Ellis and tells him he plans to retire because he feels overmatched by the recent violence. Ellis tells Bell that he cannot evade fate, and only vanity makes him think otherwise.Carla Jean returns from her mother's funeral to find Chigurh waiting in her bedroom. Chigurh says he must fulfill his vow, but offers a coin toss as a compromise. Carla Jean refuses to call it, saying that he will be responsible for her fate. Chigurh checks the soles of his boots as he leaves the house. As he drives through the neighborhood, another car crashes into him, breaking his arm. He pays a passing boy for the shirt off his back to use as a sling, and limps away.Now retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife. In the first, he lost some money his father had given him. In the other, as he rode horseback through a snowy mountain pass, his father rode past him carrying fire in a horn, and he knew his father would prepare a campfire ahead for both of them.Cast[edit]Tommy Lee Jonesas Ed Tom BellJavier BardemasAnton ChigurhJosh Brolinas Llewelyn MossWoody Harrelsonas Carson WellsKelly Macdonaldas Carla Jean MossGarret Dillahuntas WendellTess Harperas Loretta BellBarry Corbinas EllisStephen Rootas Man who hires WellsRodger Boyceas El Paso SheriffBeth Grantas Carla Jean's motherAna Reeder as Poolside WomanMatt Geistler as Poolside ManJosh BlaylockandCaleb Jonesas Boys on BikesGene Jonesas Gas Station ProprietorKathy Lamkinas Desert Aire ManagerThe role of Llewelyn Moss was originally offered toHeath Ledger, but he turned it down to spend time with his newborn daughter Matilda.[24]Garret Dillahunt was also in the running for the role of Llewelyn Moss, auditioning five times for the role,[24]but instead was offered the part of Wendell, Ed Tom Bell's deputy. Josh Brolin, who was not the Coens' first choice, enlisted the help ofQuentin TarantinoandRobert Rodriguezto make an audition reel during the production ofGrindhouse. His agent eventually secured a meeting with the Coens and he was given the part.[24]Javier Bardem nearly withdrew from the role of Anton Chigurh due to issues with scheduling. English actorMark Strongwas put on standby to take over, but the scheduling issues were resolved and Bardem took on the role.[24]Production[edit]ProducerScott Rudinbought the film rights toMcCarthy's noveland suggested an adaptation to theCoen brothers, who at the time were attempting to adapt the novelTo the White SeabyJames Dickey.[25]By August 2005, the Coens agreed to write and direct the film, having identified with how it provided a sense of place and also how it played with genre conventions. Joel Coen said that the book's unconventional approach ""was familiar, congenial to us; we're naturally attracted to subverting genre. We liked the fact that the bad guys never really meet the good guys, that McCarthy did not follow through on formula expectations.""[25][26]Ethan Coen explained that the ""pitiless quality"" was a ""hallmark of the book, which has an unforgiving landscape and characters but is also about finding some kind of beauty without being sentimental."" The adaptation was the second of McCarthy's work, followingAll the Pretty Horsesin 2000.[27]Writing[edit]The Coens' script was mostly faithful to the source material. On their writing process, Ethan said, ""One of us types into the computer while the other holds the spine of the book open flat.""[20]Still, they pruned where necessary.[25]A teenage runaway who appeared late in the book and some backstory related to Bell were both removed.[28]Also changed from the original was Carla Jean Moss's reaction when finally faced with the imposing figure of Chigurh. As explained by Kelly Macdonald, ""the ending of the book is different. She reacts more in the way I react. She kind of falls apart. In the film she's been through so much and she can't lose any more. It's just she's got this quiet acceptance of it.""[29]In the book, some attention is paid to the daughter, Deborah, whom the Bells lost and who haunts the protagonist in his thoughts.Richard CorlissofTimestated that ""the Coen brothers have adapted literary works before.Miller's Crossingwas a sly, unacknowledged blend of twoDashiell Hammetttales,Red HarvestandThe Glass Key; andO Brother Where Art Thou?transferred theOdysseyto the American south in the 1930s. ButNo Country for Old Menis their first film taken, pretty straightforwardly, from a prime American novel.""[30]The writing is also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin discussed his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with:I mean it was a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of rest upon as an actor, you know? ... Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue motivated. You have to figure out different ways to convey ideas. You don't want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning.[31]Peter TraversofRolling Stonepraised the novel adaptation. ""Not sinceRobert Altmanmerged with the short stories ofRaymond CarverinShort Cutshave filmmakers and author fused with such devastating impact as the Coens and McCarthy. Good and evil are tackled with a rigorous fix on the complexity involved.""[21]Director Joel Coen articulated his interest in the McCarthy novel. ""There's something about it – there were echoes of it inNo Country for Old Menthat were quite interesting for us"", he said, ""because it was the idea of the physical work that somebody does that helps reveal who they are and is part of the fiber of the story. Because you only saw this person in this movie making things and doing things in order to survive and to make this journey, and the fact that you were thrown back on that, as opposed to any dialogue, was interesting to us.""[32]Coen stated that this is the brothers' ""first adaptation"". He further explained why they chose the novel: ""Why not start with Cormac? Why not start with the best?"" He further described this McCarthy book in particular as ""unlike his other novels ... it is much pulpier."" Coen stated that they have not changed much in the adaptation. ""It really is just compression,"" he said. ""We didn't create new situations."" He further assured that he and his brother Ethan had never met McCarthy when they were writing the script, but first met him during the shooting of the film. He believed that the author liked the film, while his brother Ethan said, ""he didn't yell at us. We were actually sitting in a movie theater/screening room with him when he saw it ... and I heard him chuckle a couple of times, so I took that as a seal of approval, I don't know, maybe presumptuously.""[33]Title[edit]The title is taken from the opening line of the 20th-century Irish poetWilliam Butler Yeats' poem ""Sailing to Byzantium"":[34]That is no country for old men. The youngIn one another's arms, birds in the trees– Those dying generations – at their song,The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer longWhatever is begotten, born, and dies.Caught in that sensual music all neglectMonuments of unageing intellect.Richard Gillmore relates the Yeats poem to the Coens' film, saying:The lament that can be heard in these lines is for no longer belonging to the country of the young. It is also a lament for the way the young neglect the wisdom of the past and, presumably, of the old ... Yeats choosesByzantiumbecause it was a great early Christian city in whichPlato's Academy, for a time, was still allowed to function. The historical period of Byzantium was a time of culmination that was also a time of transition. In his book of mystical writings,A Vision, Yeats says, ""I think that in early Byzantium, maybe never before or since in recorded history, religious, aesthetic, and practical life were one, that architect and artificers ... spoke to the multitude and the few alike."" The idea of a balance and a coherence in a society's religious, aesthetic, and practical life is Yeats's ideal ... It is an ideal rarely realized in this world and maybe not even in ancient Byzantium. Certainly within the context of the movieNo Country for Old Men, one has the sense, especially from Bell as the chronicler of the times, that things are out of alignment, that balance and harmony are gone from the land and from the people.[35]Differences from the novel[edit]Craig Kennedy adds that ""one key difference is that of focus. The novel belongs to Sheriff Bell. Each chapter begins with Bell's narration, which dovetails and counterpoints the action of the main story. Though the film opens with Bell speaking, much of what he says in the book is condensed and it turns up in other forms. Also, Bell has an entire backstory in the book that doesn't make it into the film. The result is a movie that is more simplified thematically, but one that gives more of the characters an opportunity to shine.""[36]Jay Ellis elaborates on Chigurh's encounter with the man behind the counter at the gas station. ""Where McCarthy gives us Chigurh's question as, 'What's the most you ever saw lost on a coin toss?', he says, 'the film elides the word 'saw', but the Coens of course tend to the visual. Where the book describes the setting as 'almost dark', the film clearly depicts high noon: no shadows are notable in the establishing shot of the gas station, and the sunlight is bright even if behind cloud cover. The light through two windows and a door comes evenly through three walls in the interior shots. But this difference increases our sense of the man's desperation later, when he claims he needs to close and he closes at 'near dark'; it is darker, as it were, in the cave of this man's ignorance than it is outside in the bright light of truth.""[37]Filming[edit]The project was a co-production betweenMiramax FilmsandParamount'sclassics-based divisionin a 50/50 partnership, and production was scheduled for May 2006 inNew MexicoandTexas. With a total budget of $25 million (at least half spent in New Mexico[38]), production was slated for the New Mexico cities ofSanta Fe,Albuquerque, andLas Vegas(which doubled as the border towns ofEagle PassandDel Rio, Texas), with other scenes shot around theWest Texastowns ofSandersonandMarfa.[39]Coincidentally, Paul Thomas Anderson's filmThere Will Be Blood– another partnership between Miramax and Paramount which competed withNo Country For Old Menat theAcademy Awards– was being shot in Marfa simultaneously.[40]The Coen brothers were actually forced to scrap an entire day of filming forNo Country For Old Menwhen preparations for the oil derrick scene inThere Will Be Bloodnearby produced enough smoke to ruin all potential scenes.[41]The U.S.-Mexico border crossing bridge was actually a freeway overpass in Las Vegas, with aborder checkpointset built at the intersection ofInterstate 25andNew Mexico State Road 65.[42]The Mexican town square was filmed inPiedras Negras, Coahuila.[39]In advance of shooting, cinematographerRoger Deakinssaw that ""the big challenge"" of his ninth collaboration with the Coen brothers was ""making it very realistic, to match the story ... I'm imagining doing it very edgy and dark, and quite sparse. Not so stylized.""[43]""Everything's storyboarded before we start shooting,"" Deakins said inEntertainment Weekly. ""InNo Country, there's maybe only a dozen shots that are not in the final film. It's that order of planning. And we only shot 250,000 feet, whereas most productions of that size might shoot 700,000 or a million feet of film. It's quite precise, the way they approach everything. ... We never use a zoom,"" he said. ""I don't even carry a zoom lens with me, unless it's for something very specific."" The famous coin-tossing scene between Chigurh and the old gas station clerk is a good example; the camera tracks in so slowly that the audience isn't even aware of the move. ""When the camera itself moves forward, the audience is moving, too. You're actually getting closer to somebody or something. It has, to me, a much more powerful effect, because it's a three-dimensional move. A zoom is more like a focusing of attention. You're just standing in the same place and concentrating on one smaller element in the frame. Emotionally, that's a very different effect.""[44]In a later interview, he mentioned the ""awkward dilemma [that]No Countrycertainly contains scenes of some very realistically staged fictional violence, but ... without this violent depiction of evil there would not be the emotional 'pay off' at the end of the film when Ed Tom bemoans the fact that God has not entered his life.""[45]Directing[edit]In an interview withThe Guardian, Ethan said, ""Hard men in the south-west shooting each other – that's definitely Sam Peckinpah's thing. We were aware of those similarities, certainly.""[20]They discuss choreographing and directing the film's violent scenes in theSydney Morning Herald: ""'That stuff is such fun to do', the brothers chime in at the mention of their penchant for blood-letting. 'Even Javier would come in by the end of the movie, rub his hands together and say, 'OK, who am I killing today?' adds Joel. 'It's fun to figure out', says Ethan. 'It's fun working out how to choreograph it, how to shoot it, how to engage audiences watching it.'""[46]Director Joel Coen described the process of film making: ""I can almost set my watch by how I'm going to feel at different stages of the process. It's always identical, whether the movie ends up working or not. I think when you watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away. And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before.""[32]David DenbyofThe New Yorkercriticized the way the Coens ""disposed of"" Llewelyn Moss. ""The Coens, however faithful to the book"", he said, ""cannot be forgiven for disposing of Llewelyn so casually. After watching this foolhardy but physically gifted and decent guy escape so many traps, we have a great deal invested in him emotionally, and yet he's eliminated, off-camera, by some unknown Mexicans. He doesn't get the dignity of a death scene. The Coens have suppressed their natural jauntiness. They have become orderly, disciplined masters of chaos, but one still has the feeling that, out there on the road from nowhere to nowhere, they are rooting for it rather than against it.""[47]Josh Brolindiscussed the Coens' directing style in an interview, saying that the brothers ""only really say what needs to be said. They don't sit there as directors and manipulate you and go into page after page to try to get you to a certain place. They may come in and say one word or two words, so that was nice to be around in order to feed the other thing. 'What should I do right now? I'll just watch Ethan go humming to himself and pacing. Maybe that's what I should do, too.'""[31]In an interview with Logan Hill ofNew Yorkmagazine, Brolin said, ""We had a load of fun making it. Maybe it was because we both [Brolin andJavier Bardem] thought we'd be fired. With the Coens, there's zero compliments, really zero anything. No 'nice work.' Nothing. And then—I'm doing this scene withWoody Harrelson. Woody can't remember his lines, he stumbles his way through it, and then both Coens are like, 'Oh my God! Fantastic!'""[48]David Gritten ofThe Daily Telegraphwonders: ""Are the Coens finally growing up?"" He adds: ""If [the film] feels pessimistic, Joel insists that's not the Coens' responsibility: 'I don't think the movie is more or less so than the novel. We tried to give it the same feeling.' The brothers do concede, however, that it's a dark piece of storytelling. 'It's refreshing for us to do different kinds of things,' says Ethan, 'and we'd just done a couple of comedies.'""[49]Musical score and sound[edit]The Coens minimized the score used in the film, leaving large sections devoid of music.[50][51]The concept was Ethan's, who persuaded a skeptical Joel to go with the idea. There is some music in the movie, scored by the Coens' longtime composer,Carter Burwell, but after finding that ""most musical instruments didn't fit with the minimalist sound sculpture he had in mind ... he usedsinging bowls, standing metal bells traditionally employed inBuddhistmeditation practice that produce a sustained tone when rubbed."" The movie contains a ""mere"" 16 minutes of music, with several of those in the end credits. The music in the trailer was called ""Diabolic Clockwork"" byTwo Steps from Hell. Sound editing and effects were provided by another longtime Coens collaborator,Skip Lievsay, who used a mixture of emphatic sounds (gun shots) and ambient noise (engine noise, prairie winds) in the mix. Thefoleyfor the captive bolt pistol used by Chigurh was created using a pneumatic nail gun.[50]Anthony LaneofThe New Yorkerstates that ""there is barely any music, sensual or otherwise, and Carter Burwell's score is little more than a fitful murmur"",[52]and Douglas McFarland states that ""perhaps [the film's] salient formal characteristic is the absence, with one telling exception, of a musical soundtrack, creating a mood conducive to thoughtful and unornamented speculation in what is otherwise a fierce and destructive landscape.""[53]Jay Ellis, however, disagrees. ""[McFarland] missed the extremely quiet but audible fade in a few tones from a keyboard beginning when Chigurh flips the coin for the gas station man"", he said. ""This ambient music (by long-time Coens collaborator Carter Burwell) grows imperceptibly in volume so that it is easily missed as an element of the mis-en-scene. But it is there, telling our unconscious that something different is occurring with the toss; this becomes certain when it ends as Chigurh uncovers the coin on the counter. The deepest danger has passed as soon as Chigurh finds (and Javier Bardem's acting confirms this) and reveals to the man that he has won.""[54]In order to achieve such a sound effect, Burwell ""tuned the music's swelling hum to the 60-hertz frequency of a refrigerator.""[50]Dennis Lim ofThe New York Timesstressed that ""there is virtually no music on the soundtrack of this tense, methodical thriller. Long passages are entirely wordless. In some of the most gripping sequences what you hear mostly is a suffocating silence."" Skip Lievsay, the film's sound editor called this approach ""quite a remarkable experiment,"" and added that ""suspense thrillers in Hollywood are traditionally done almost entirely with music. The idea here was to remove the safety net that lets the audience feel like they know what's going to happen. I think it makes the movie much more suspenseful. You're not guided by the score and so you lose that comfort zone.""[50]James Roman observes the effect of sound in the scene where Chigurh pulls in for gas at theTexacorest stop. ""[The] scene evokes an eerie portrayal of innocence confronting evil,"" he says, ""with the subtle images richly nuanced by sound. As the scene opens in a long shot, the screen is filled with the remote location of the rest stop with the sound of theTexacosign mildly squeaking in a light breeze. The sound and image of a crinkled cashew wrapper tossed on the counter adds to the tension as the paper twists and turns. The intimacy and potential horror that it suggests is never elevated to a level of kitschy drama as the tension rises from the mere sense of quiet and doom that prevails.""[55]Jeffrey Overstreetadds that ""the scenes in which Chigurh stalks Moss are as suspenseful as anything the Coens have ever staged. And that has as much to do with what wehearas what wesee.No Country for Old Menlacks a traditional soundtrack, but don't say it doesn't have music. The blip-blip-blip of a transponder becomes as frightening as the famous theme fromJaws. The sound of footsteps on the hardwood floors of a hotel hallway are as ominous as the drums of war. When the leather of a briefcase squeaks against the metal of a ventilation shaft, you'll cringe, and the distant echo of a telephone ringing in a hotel lobby will jangle your nerves.""[56]Style[edit]WhileNo Country for Old Menis a ""doggedly faithful"" adaptation of McCarthy's 2005 novel and its themes, the film also revisits themes which the Coens had explored in their earlier moviesBlood SimpleandFargo.[57]The three films share common themes, such aspessimismandnihilism.[58][59][60][61]The novel's motifs of chance, free-will, and predestination are familiar territory for the Coen brothers, who presented similar threads and tapestries of ""fate [and] circumstance"" in earlier works includingRaising Arizona, which featured another hitman, albeit less serious in tone.[62][63]Numerous critics cited the importance of chance to both the novel and the film, focusing on Chigurh's fate-decidingcoin flipping,[64]but noted that the nature of the film medium made it difficult to include the ""self-reflective qualities of McCarthy's novel.""[65]At the start of the film, Bell ruminates on a teenage criminal he arrested who was sentenced to death; although the newspapers described the boy's murder of his 14-year-old girlfriend as a crime of passion, Bell muses that ""he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me he'd been planning to kill someone for about as long as he could remember. Said if they turned him out, he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about 15 minutes. I don't know what to make of that.  I surely don't"".[66]Chicago Sun-TimescriticRoger Ebertpraised the narration: ""These words sounded verbatim to me fromNo Country for Old Men, the novel byCormac McCarthy... But I find they are not quite. And their impact has been improved upon in the delivery. When I get the DVD of this film, I will listen to that stretch of narration several times; Jones delivers it with a vocal precision and contained emotion that is extraordinary, and it sets up the entire film.""[11]InThe Village Voice, Scott Foundas writes that ""Like McCarthy, the Coens are markedly less interested in who (if anyone) gets away with the loot than in the primal forces that urge the characters forward ... In the end, everyone inNo Country for Old Menis both hunter and hunted, members of someendangered speciestrying to forestall theirextinction.""[67]Ebert writes that ""the movie demonstrates how pitiful ordinary human feelings are in the face of implacable injustice.""[11]New York TimescriticA. O. Scottobserves that Chigurh, Moss, and Bell each ""occupy the screen one at a time, almost never appearing in the frame together, even as their fates become ever more intimately entwined.""[68]Varietycritic Todd McCarthy describes Chigurh'smodus operandi: ""Death walks hand in hand with Chigurh wherever he goes, unless he decides otherwise ... [I]f everything you've done in your life has led you to him, he may explain to his about-to-be victims, your time might just have come. 'You don't have to do this,' the innocent invariably insist to a man whose murderous code dictates otherwise. Occasionally, however, he will allow someone to decide his own fate by coin toss, notably in a tense early scene in an old filling station marbled with nervous humor.""[69]Jim Emerson describes how the Coens introduced Chigurh in one of the first scenes when he strangles the deputy who arrested him: ""A killer rises: Our first blurred sight of Chigurh's face ... As he moves forward, into focus, to make his first kill, we still don't get a good look at him because his head rises above the top of the frame. His victim, the deputy, never sees what's coming, and Chigurh, chillingly, doesn't even bother to look at his face while hegarroteshim.""[70]CriticPeter BradshawofThe Guardianstated that ""the savoury, serio-comic tang of the Coens' film-making style is recognisably present, as is their predilection for the weirdness of hotels and motels"". But he added that they ""have found something that has heightened and deepened their identity as film-makers: a real sense of seriousness, a sense that their offbeat Americana and gruesome and surreal comic contortions can really be more than the sum of their parts"".[71]Geoff Andrew ofTime Out Londonsaid that the Coens ""find a cinematic equivalent toMcCarthy'slanguage: his narrative ellipses, play with point of view, and structural concerns such as the exploration of the similarities and differences between Moss, Chigurh and Bell. Certain virtuoso sequences feel near-abstract in their focus on objects, sounds, light, colour or camera angle rather than on human presence ... Notwithstanding much marvellous deadpan humour, this is one of their darkest efforts.""[72]Arne De Boever believes that there is a ""close affinity, and intimacy even, between the sheriff and Chigurh inNo Country for Old Men[which is developed] in a number of scenes. There is, to begin with, the sheriff's voice at the beginning of the film, which accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial weaving together of the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff is further developed later on in the film, when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean. Chigurh has visited the trailer only minutes before, and the Coen brothers have the sheriff sit down in the same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting (which is almost the exact same spot where, the evening before, Moss joined his wife on the couch). Like Chigurh, the sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were to superimpose these two shots. When the sheriff pours himself a glass of milk from the bottle that stands sweating on the living room table—a sign that the sheriff and his colleague, deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt), only just missed their man—this mirroring of images goes beyond the level of reflection, and Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both.""[73]Depicted violence[edit]In an interview withCharlie Rose, co-director Joel Coen acknowledged that ""there's a lot of violence in the book,"" and considered the violence depicted in the film as ""very important to the story"". He further added that ""we couldn't conceive it, sort of soft pedaling that in the movie, and really doing a thing resembling the book ... it's about a character confronting a very arbitrary violent brutal world, and you have to see that.""[33]Los Angeles TimescriticKenneth Turancommented on the violence depicted in the film: ""The Coen brothers dropped the mask. They've put violence on screen before, lots of it, but not like this. Not anything like this.No Country for Old Mendoesn't celebrate or smile at violence; it despairs of it."" However, Turan explained that ""no one should seeNo Country for Old Menunderestimating the intensity of its violence. But it's also clear that the Coen brothers andMcCarthyare not interested in violence for its own sake, but for what it says about the world we live in ... As the film begins, a confident deputy says I got it under control, and in moments he is dead. He didn't have anywhere near the mastery he imagined. And in this despairing vision, neither does anyone else.""[74]NPRcriticBob Mondelloadds that ""despite working with a plot about implacable malice, the Coen Brothers don't ever overdo. You could even say they know the value of understatement: At one point they garner chills simply by having a character check the soles of his boots as he steps from a doorway into the sunlight. By that time, blood has pooled often enough inNo Country for Old Menthat they don't have to show you what he's checking for.""[75]According to a study published by researchers at theUniversité libre de Bruxelles, Belgium, in 2014, Chigurh is the most clinically accurate portrayal of a psychopath to date.[76]Critic Stephanie Zacharek ofSalonstates that ""this adaptation ofCormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, the kind of thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points – that's nothing new – but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty.No Country for Old Menfeels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, as if he were a schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town.""[77]Ryan P. Doom explains how the violence devolves as the film progresses: ""The savagery of American violence begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates the level of the Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers. ... Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During the first half of the film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his feet up on the bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [boots] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again.""[78]Similarities to earlier Coen brothers films[edit]Richard Gillmore states that ""the previous Coen brothers movie that has the most in common withNo Country for Old Menis, in fact,Fargo(1996). InFargothere is an older, wiser police chief, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) just as there is inNo Country for Old Men. In both movies, a local police officer is confronted with some grisly murders committed by men who are not from his or her town. In both movies, greed lies behind the plots. Both movies feature as a central character a cold-blooded killer who does not seem quite human and whom the police officer seeks to apprehend.""[35]Joel Coen and David Gritten agree. In an interview with Gritten ofThe Daily Telegraph, Gritten states that ""overall [the film] seems to belong in a rarefied category of Coen films occupied only byFargo(1996), which ... is also a crime story with a decent small-town sheriff as its central character. Joel sighs. 'I know. There are parallels.' He shakes his head. 'These things really should seem obvious to us.'""[49]In addition, Ethan Coen states that ""we're not conscious of it, [and] to the extent that we are, we try to avoid it. The similarity toFargodid occur to us, not that it was a good or a bad thing. That's the only thing that comes to mind as being reminiscent of our own movies, [and] it is by accident.""[79]Richard CorlissofTimemagazine adds that ""there's also Tommy Lee Jones playing a cop as righteous as Marge inFargo"",[80]while Paul Arendt of theBBCstated that the film transplants the ""despairing nihilism and tar-black humour ofFargoto the arid plains ofBlood Simple.""[81]Some critics have also identified similarities betweenNo Country for Old Menand the Coens' previous filmRaising Arizona, namely the commonalities shared by Anton Chigurh and the fellow bounty hunter Leonard Smalls.[82]Genre[edit]""Crime western noir horror comedy""—Critic Rob Mackie ofThe Guardianon the many genres he believes are reflected in the film.[83]Although Paul Arendt of theBBCfinds that ""No Country ...can be enjoyed as a straightforward genre thriller"" with ""suspense sequences ... that rival the best ofHitchcock"",[81]in other respects the film can be described as a western, and the question remains unsettled. For Richard Gillmore, it ""is, and is not, a western. It takes place in the West and its main protagonists are what you might call westerners. On the other hand, the plot revolves around a drug deal that has gone bad; it involves four-wheel-drive vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, and executives in high-rise buildings, none of which would seem to belong in a western.""[35]William J. Devlin finesses the point, calling the film a ""neo-western"", distinguishing it from the classic western by the way it ""demonstrates a decline, or decay, of the traditional western ideal ... The moral framework of the West ... that contained ... innocent and wholesome heroes who fought for what is right, is fading. The villains, or the criminals, act in such a way that the traditional hero cannot make sense of their criminal behavior.""[84]Deborah Biancott sees a ""western gothic ..., a struggle for and with God, an examination of a humanity haunted by its past and condemned to the horrors of its future. ... [I]t's a tale of unrepentant evil, the frightening but compelling bad guy who lives by a moral code that is unrecognizable and alien. The wanderer, the psychopath, Anton Chigurh, is a man who's supernaturally invincible.""[85]Even the directors have weighed in. Joel Coen found the film ""interesting in a genre way; but it was also interesting to us because it subverts the genre expectations.""[86]He did not consider the film a western because ""when we think about westerns we think about horses andsix-guns, saloons and hitching posts."" But co-director Ethan said that the film ""is sort of a western,"" before adding ""and sort of not.""[87]Gillmore, though, thinks that it is ""a mixing of the two great American movie genres, the western and film noir,"" which ""reflect the two sides of the American psyche. On the one hand, there is a western in which the westerner is faced with overwhelming odds, but between his perseverance and his skill, he overcomes the odds and triumphs. ... In film noir, on the other hand, the hero is smart (more or less) and wily and there are many obstacles to overcome, the odds are against him, and, in fact, he fails to overcome them. ... This genre reflects the pessimism and fatalism of the American psyche. WithNo Country for Old Men, the Coens combine these two genres into one movie. It is a western with a tragic, existential, film noir ending.""[35]Themes and analysis[edit]One of the themes in the story involves the tension between destiny and self-determination. According to Richard Gillmore, the main characters are torn between a sense of inevitability ""that the world goes on its way and that it does not have much to do with human desires and concerns"", and the notion that our futures are inextricably connected to our own past actions.[35]Enda McCaffrey details a character who refuses to acknowledge his own agency, noting that Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) ignores repeated reminders that he doesn't have to behave as he does and suggesting that by relegating the lives of Carla and the gas station clerk to a coin toss, he hands ""responsibility over to 'fate' in an act of bad faith that prevents him from taking responsibility for his own ethical choices"".[88]Not only behavior, but position alters. One of the themes developed in the story is the shifting identity of hunter and hunted. Scott Foundas stresses that everyone in the film plays both roles,[89]while Judie Newman focuses on the moments of transition, when hunter Llewelyn Moss and investigator Wells become themselves targets.[90]The story contrasts old narratives of the ""Wild West"" with modern crimes, suggesting that the heroes of old can at best hope to escape from rather than to triumph over evil. William J. Devlin explores the narrative of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, an aging Western hero, symbolic of an older tradition, who does not serve an underpopulated ""Wild West"", but an evolved landscape with new breeds of crime which baffle him.[91]William Luhrfocuses on the perspective of the retiring lawman played byTommy Lee Jonesat the beginning of the film, who is withdrawing from an evil which he cannot understand or address, reflecting the film's millennial worldview with ""no hope for a viable future, only the remote possibility of individual detachment from it all"".[92]Release[edit]Theatrical release and box office[edit]Javier Bardem(left) with theCoen brothersat the2007 Cannes Film FestivalNo Country for Old Menpremiered in competition at the2007 Cannes Film Festivalon May 19.[6]Stephen Robb of theBBCcovered the film opening at Cannes. ""With no sign yet of an undisputed classic in competition at this 60th Cannes,"" he said, ""No Country for Old Menmay have emerged as a frontrunner for the trophy Joel and Ethan Coen collected forBarton Finkin 1991. ""We are very fortunate in that our films have sort of found a home here,"" says Joel. ""From the point of view of getting the movies out to an audience, this has always been a very congenial platform.""The reception to the film's first press screening in Cannes was positive.Screen International's jury of critics, assembled for its daily Cannes publication, all gave the film three or four marks out of four. Themagazine's review said the film fell short of ""the greatness that sometimes seems within its grasp"". But it added that the film was ""guaranteed to attract a healthy audience on the basis of the track record of those involved, respect for the novel and critical support"".[93][94]The film commercially opened inlimited releasein 28 theaters in the United States on November 9, 2007, grossing $1,226,333 over the opening weekend, and opened in the United Kingdom (limited release) and Ireland on January 18, 2008.[95]The film expanded to a wide release in 860 theaters in the United States on November 21, 2007, grossing $7,776,773 over the first weekend.

""The final balance sheet was a $74 million gross"" domestically.[86]Miramax employed its typical ""gradual-release"" strategy: it was ""released in November, ... was initially given a limited release, ... and ... benefited from the nomination and the win, with weekend grosses picking up after each"".

It stated that ""with itsAVCMPEG-4video on BD-50, the picture quality ofNo Country for Old Menstands on the highest rung of the home video ladder. Color vibrancy, black level, resolution and contrast are reference quality ... Every line and wrinkle in Bell's face is resolved and Chigurh sports a pageboy haircut in which every strand of hair appears individually distinguishable. No other film brings its characters to life so vividly solely on the merits of visual technicalities ... Watch the nighttime shoot-out between Moss and Chigurh outside the hotel ... As bullets slam through the windshield of Moss's getaway car, watch as every crack and bullet hole in the glass is extraordinarily defined.""The audio quality earned an almost full mark, where the ""24-bit 48kHzlosslessPCMserves voices well, and excels in more treble-prone sounds ... Perhaps the most audibly dynamic sequence is the dawn chase scene after Moss returns with water. Close your eyes and listen to Moss's breathing and footsteps as he runs, the truck in pursuit as it labors over rocks and shrubs, the crack of the rifle and hissing of bullets as they rip through the air and hit the ground ... the entire sequence and the film overall sounds very convincing.""[104]Kenneth S. Brown of website High-Def Digest stated that ""the Blu-ray edition of the film ... is magnificent ... and includes all of the480i/pspecial features that appear on the standard DVD. However, to my disappointment, the slim supplemental package doesn't include a much needed directors' commentary from the Coens. It would have been fascinating to listen to the brothers dissect the differences between the original novel and the Oscar-winning film.

For other uses, seePrestige.The PrestigeFirst editionAuthorChristopher PriestAudio read byPeter KennyLanguageEnglishGenreScience fiction,Horror fictionPublisherTouchstone,Simon & SchusterPublication date1995Publication placeUnited KingdomMedia typePrintPages404ISBN0-671-71924-6LC ClassPR6066.R55 P74The Prestigeis a 1995epistolaryscience fantasymysterynovel byChristopher Priest. It tells the story of a prolonged feud between two stage magicians in late 1800s England. Its main structure is that of a collection of diaries that were kept by the protagonists and later collated. The title derives from the novel's fictional practice of stage illusions having three parts: the setup, the performance, and the prestige (effect).[1]The novel received theJames Tait Black Memorial Prizefor best fiction and theWorld Fantasy Award for Best Novel.[2]Plot[edit]Past events are told through the diaries of nineteenth-century magicians Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden. The diaries are read by their great-grandchildren, Kate Angier and Andrew Westley (born Nicholas Borden), who meet in the present day. Throughout the novel, the two diary accounts are interspersed with events of Kate's and Andrew'sframing story. Andrew's story is related to his childhood as an adoptee and his current job as a journalist. Kate's story is related to a traumatic event that happened when she was five years old, in which she witnessed her father murder a small boy. This leads her to search for Andrew, whom she believes is the twin of the murdered boy. As the diaries are read, the truth of what happened to Andrew's twin is explained by the history of Angier and Borden.The central plot focuses on a feud between the magicians, begun in the fledgling years of their careers when Borden disrupts a fake seance being conducted by Angier and his pregnant wife Julia after they had conducted a previous one for one of Borden's relatives. Borden was upset that they had presented it as real when he realized it was an illusion. During the scuffle, Julia is thrown to the ground, resulting in a miscarriage. The two men are mutually antagonistic for many years afterwards as they rise to become world-renowned stage magicians, with the feud affecting the later generations of their families to come, including Kate and Andrew.Borden develops ateleportationact called ""The Transported Man"", and later creates an improved version named ""The New Transported Man"", which appears to move him from one closed cabinet to another in the blink of an eye without appearing to pass through the intervening space. The act seems to defy physics and puts all previous magic acts to shame. The reader learns that Alfred Borden is actually not one man but two: identical twins named Albert and Frederick who share the identity of ""Alfred Borden"" secretly to ensure their professional success with ""The New Transported Man"". Angier suspects that Borden uses a double, but dismisses the idea because he thinks it is too easy.In the meantime, Angier had developed his own act and left his wife for his stage assistant, Olivia. Desperate to discover how Borden's trick is performed, Angier sends Olivia to spy on Borden. However, Olivia begins to fall in love with Borden, and they conspire to send Angier on a wild goose chase thinking that the act relies on technology from the acclaimed inventorNikola Tesla. After being contacted by Angier, Tesla eventually constructs a machine which Angier uses to develop an act called ""In a Flash"". Tesla's device teleports a human being from one place to another by creating an exact physical duplicate at a specified destination into which the person's consciousness is instantly transmitted while the original body is left behind, lifeless. Because of this method, Angier is forced to devise a way to conceal the original bodies whenever the trick is performed. He clinically refers to these near-lifeless shells in his diary as ""the prestige materials"".Angier's new act is as successful as Borden's. The infuriated and obsessed Borden attempts to discover how ""In a Flash"" is performed. During one performance he breaks into the backstage area and turns off the power to Angier's device, mistakenly believing the generator powering it is about to catch fire and light the theatre ablaze. The subsequent teleportation is incomplete and both the duplicated Angier and the ""prestige"" Angier survive as separate persons after this incident, though the duplicate seems to lack physical substance while the original feels increasingly weak physically. The original ""prestige"" Angier fakes his own death as part of a previous plan to put behind his public persona of a magician, and returns as the heir to his family estate of Caldlow House without any publicity. While there, he becomes terminally ill.Angier had discovered Borden's secret as a twin prior to the accident that created his duplicate. Angier's duplicate, feeling alienated from the world by his ghostly form and consumed with thoughts of revenge, attacks one of the Borden twins before a performance. However, Borden's apparent poor health, age, and the duplicate Angier's resurgent sense of morality cause him to stop short of murdering the twin. It is implied that this particular Borden twin dies a few days later, and the incorporeal Angier travels to meet the original ""prestige"" Angier, now living as the 14th Earl of Colderdale. They come into possession of Borden's diary, courtesy of a disgruntled third party in need of money, but publish it without revealing the twins' secret. Shortly afterwards, the corporeal Angier dies and his ghostly duplicate uses Tesla's device one last time to teleport himself into the body, hoping that he will either reanimate it and become whole again or kill himself instantly and so reunite with his other self in death.In the final section of the novel, Kate and Andrew's mystery is revealed. Andrew Westley goes into the Angier family vault and finds all of Rupert Angier's near-lifeless shells (prestige materials) labelled with the date and place they were created. Andrew also finds a prestige of a small boy labeled Nicholas Julius Borden, with his place of creation listed as Caldlow House. It is then understood that Andrew himself never had a twin. When Kate and Andrew were children, their families had met in an attempt to mend the rift between them. However, during an argument, Kate's father had cast the young Nicholas Borden into the Tesla device, rendering the ""prestige"" Nicholas Borden lifeless on the ground and creating the duplicate who later became Andrew Westley. It is also revealed to Kate Angier and Andrew Westley that Angier's attempt to become whole again was successful, and some form of Rupert Angier had continued to survive in the Caldlow House to the present day.Critical reception[edit]David Langfordwrote in a 1996 review, ""It seems entirely logical that Christopher Priest's latest novel should centre on stage magic and magicians. The particular brand of misdirection that lies at the heart of theatrical conjuring is also a favourite Priest literary ploy – the art of not so much fooling the audience as encouraging them to fool themselves... The final section is strange indeed, more Gothic thanscience fictionin flavour, heavy with metaphorical power. There are revelations, and more is implied about the peculiar nature of the Angier/Tesla effect's payoff or 'prestige' – a term used in this sense by both magicians. The trick is done; before and after, Priest has rolled up both sleeves; his hands are empty and he fixes you with an honest look. And yet ... you realise that it is necessary to readThe Prestigeagain. It's an extraordinary performance, his best book in years, perhaps his best ever. Highly recommended.""[3]Publishers Weeklysaid, ""This is a complex tale that must have been extremely difficult to tell in exactly the right sequence, while still maintaining a series of shocks to the very end. Priest has brought it off with great imagination and skill. It's only fair to say, though, that the book's very considerable narrative grip is its principal virtue. The characters and incidents have a decidedly Gothic cast, and only the restraint that marks the story's telling keeps it on the rails.""[4]Elizabeth Handwrote, ""There is a certain amount of grim humor toThe Prestige, the blatant Can-You-Top-This? careerism of dueling prestidigitators whose feud is carried out against the lush backdrop offin-de-siècleLondon. And the novel provides the pleasures of a mystery as well, as the reader attempts to find the man (or men) behind the curtain, and discover the true parentage of Andrew Westley, who may or may not be related to Borden. But at its coreThe Prestigeis a horror novel, and a particularly terrifying one because its secret is revealed so slowly, and in such splendid language...The Prestigeis both disturbing and exhilarating – one closes the book shaken, wondering how it was done; and eager to see what the master illusionist will produce for his next trick.""[5]Adam Kirkman called the novel ""vastly underrated... Priest weaves together a tale of two feuding stage magicians at the turn of the century, a dark but mesmerising story that sees two men become consumed with, and eventually destroyed by, obsession. While the film hammers you over the head with clues about the final twist, so much so that you feel embarrassed when re-watching it, Priest's novel is more subtle, although a smart reader is in on the trick from the start. The real beauty of this novel is the characters, who are fleshed out more fully here than on screen, and the magical elements of the story achieve a fantastical, creepy edge. If you enjoyed the film, then Priest's novel is grander in scope and more chilling in nature, and is a gem that should not be ignored.""[6]The Guardianreview said, ""Behind all the surface trickery lies an intelligent and thoughtful novel about the nature of illusion and secrecy, and about the damage done to those who appoint themselves keepers of such dangerous secrets.""[7]A review inKliattof theaudiobookversion narrated by Simon Vance described it as ""a spellbinding and entirely original neo-gothic thriller that moves the listener adroitly from the world of staged illusion to the otherworldly, from the historical...to the horror-laden, with all sorts of strange and dazzling stops along the way. The plot is convoluted and occasionally technical, spanning generations and incorporatingmultiple narratorsand a large cast of characters. A lesser audiobook narrator might inadvertently muddle the story, but, as usual, Vance displays a dramatic and vocal range that is more than equal to his task. He enhances Priest's novel with superb pacing and a host of highly convincing voices and accents.""[8]Awards and nominations[edit]British Fantasy Awardnominee, 1995[9]James Tait Black Memorial Prizewinner, 1996Bram Stoker Awardnominee, 1996[10]World Fantasy Awardwinner, 1996[2]Arthur C.

It features anensemble castincludingSam Worthington,Zoe Saldana,Stephen Lang,Michelle Rodriguez, andSigourney Weaver.[6]The first installment in theAvatarfilm series, it is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizingPandora, a lushhabitable moonof agas giantin theAlpha Centauristar system, in order to mine the valuableunobtanium,[c]aroom-temperature superconductormineral. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe ofNa'vi, ahumanoidspecies indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to agenetically engineeredNa'vi bodyoperated from the brainof a remotely located human that is used tointeractwith the natives of Pandora called an ""Avatar"".[10]Development ofAvatarbegan in 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.[11][12]Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 filmTitanic, for a planned release in 1999;[13]however, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.[14]Work on thefictional constructedlanguage of the Na'vibegan in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay andfictional universein early 2006.[15][16]Avatarwas officially budgeted at $237 million, due to the groundbreaking array of new visual effects Cameron achieved in cooperation withWeta DigitalinWellington.[4]Other estimates put the cost at between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion.[17][18][19]The film made extensive use of3D computer graphicsand newmotion capturefilming techniques, and was released for traditional viewing,3Dviewing (using theRealD 3D,Dolby 3D,XpanD 3D, andIMAX 3Dformats), and4Dexperiences (in selected South Korean theaters).[20]The film also saw Cameron reunite with hisTitanicco-producerJon Landau, who he would later credit for having a prominent role in the film's production.[21]Avatarpremiered at theOdeon Leicester Squarein London on December 10, 2009, and was released in the United States on December 18. The film received positive reviews from critics, who highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story received some criticism for being derivative.[22][23][24]During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming thehighest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken byAvengers: Endgame, but with a re-release in China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[25]Adjusted for inflation,Avataris thesecond-highest-grossing movieof all time, only behindGone with the Wind(1939), with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[26]and thebest-selling video title of 2010 in the United States.Avatarwas nominated for nine awards at the82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and receivednumerous other accolades. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing3D televisions[27]and caused 3D films[28]to increase in popularity. Its success led to theAvatarfranchise, which includes the sequelsThe Way of Water(2022),Fire and Ash(2025),Avatar 4(2029), andAvatar 5(2031).PlotIn 2154, Earth suffers from resource exhaustion and ecological collapse. TheResources Development Administration (RDA)mines the valuable mineralunobtaniumonPandora, a lushhabitable moonorbiting agas giantin theAlpha Centauristar system. Pandora, whoseatmosphereis inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by theNa'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapienthumanoidsthat live in harmony withnature.To explore Pandora,geneticallymatched human scientists control Na'vi-human hybrids called ""avatars"".ParaplegicformerMarineJake Sullyis recruited by the RDA to replace his deceasedidentical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Jake inadequate, but accepts him as an operator.While escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by the Na'vi princessNeytiri. Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother, Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.ColonelMiles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe, and they choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree would damage thebiological neural networkthat encompasses all Pandoran life, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate. Jake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Grace is shot and fatally wounded.Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of the Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. Supported by Neytiri and the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Before the battle, Jake prays to the Na'vi deityEywavia a neural connection with the Tree of Souls.Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties. The Na'vi are rescued whenPandoran wildlifeunexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, in anAMP suit, escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to kill Jake's avatar, he is killed by Neytiri, who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time.In the aftermath of the war, the RDA are expelled from Pandora; only some humans are chosen to stay, including Max and Norm. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, Neytiri, and Mo'at.CastFurther information:Fictional universe of AvatarSam Worthington(left, pictured in 2013) andZoe Saldana(right, pictured in 2013), who played the lead roles in the filmSam WorthingtonasJake Sully:Adisabledformer Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him.[29]Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down.[30]In the beginning, Cameron offered the role toMatt Damon, with a 10% stake in the film's profits, but Damon turned the film down because of his commitment toThe Bourne Ultimatum(2007).[31]Other notable actors who auditioned for the part includeChris PrattandChris Pinewith the studio pushingJake Gyllenhaalto play the role, but Gyllenhaal turned the film down because he wished to focus onPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time(2010) instead[32][33][34]Ultimately, the three finalists for the role wereChanning Tatum,Chris Evans, and Worthington, with Cameron ultimately going with Worthington.[35]Worthington, who was living in his car at the time,[36]initially thought that he would not be cast due to his frustration in the initial audition,[37]but has since signed on for possible sequels.[38]Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character ""a quality that is really real"". Cameron said he ""has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world"".[39]Worthington also briefly appears as Jake's deceased identical twin, Dr. Tom ""Tommy"" Sully.Zoe Saldana, asNeytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite:The daughter of the leader of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story), She is heir to the spiritual leader of the clan. She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naiveté and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest.[40]In earlier drafts of the screenplay, this character was known as ""Zuleika Te Kaha Polenoma"". When the film began to be developed,Charisma Carpenterwas set to play the role. But by the time the film had been greenlit in 2006, Carpenter had become too old for the role and was thus not cast. Cameron then began a worldwide search for actresses to play the role, withQ'orianka Kilcherbeing considered andEmily Bluntauditioning for the role.[41][42][43]Eventually, Cameron cast Saldana in the role. Since she was cast early in production, Saldana helped screen-test actors auditioning for the part of Jake Sully, including eventual co-star  Worthington.[44]The character, like all the Na'vi, was created usingperformance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated.[45]Saldaña signed on for potential sequels.[46]Stephen Langas ColonelMiles Quaritch:The head of the mining operation's security detail.[47]Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language.[47]Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron'sAliens(1986), but the director remembered Lang and sought him forAvatar.[48]Michael Biehn, who had worked with Cameron inAliens,The Terminator(1984) andTerminator 2: Judgment Day(1991), was briefly considered for the role. He read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron[49]but was ultimately not cast.Michelle Rodriguezas Captain Trudy Chacón:Acombat pilotassigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi. Cameron had wanted to work with Rodriguez since seeing her inGirlfight(2000).[48]Giovanni Ribisias Parker Selfridge:The corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation.[50][51][52]While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company'sbottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.Joel David Mooreas Dr. Norm Spellman:Axenoanthropologist[53]who studies plant and animal life as part of the Avatar Program.[54]He arrives on Pandora at the same time as Jake and operates an avatar. Although he is expected to lead the diplomatic contact with the Na'vi, it turns out that Jake has the personality better suited to win the natives' respect.Josh Gadwas a runner-up for the role.[55]Moore also portrays Norm's Na'vi avatar.CCH Pounderas Mo'at:The spiritual leader of the Omaticaya. She is the mother of Neytiri and mate to Eytukan, the clan's leader.[56]Wes Studias Eytukan te Tskaha Kamun'itan:Theclan chiefof the Omaticaya.

She is also Jake's mentor and an advocate of peaceful relations with the Na'vi, having set up a school to teach them English.[57]Weaver dyed her hair red for the part.[58]Her character was named ""Shipley"" at one point.[59]The character reminded Weaver of Cameron, being ""very driven and very idealistic"".[60]Weaver also portrays Grace's Na'vi avatar.Dileep Raoas Dr. Max Patel:A scientist who works in the Avatar Program and comes to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA[61]Matt Geraldas Corporal Lyle Wainfleet:Amercenarywho works for the RDA as Quaritch's right-hand man.Additionally, Alicia Vela-Bailey appears, uncredited, as Ikeyni, the leader of the Tayrangi clan, Saeyla, one of the young Na'vi hunters who accompany Jake during his Iknimaya and a harassed blonde woman in a bar that Jake defends. Vela-Bailey served as the stunt double for Zoe Saldana and would later portray Zdinarsk inAvatar: The Way of Water.Terry Notary, who performed stunts as well, plays the Banshees via motion capture.ProductionOriginsDirector/writer and producerJames Cameronin December 2009 on Hollywood Walk of Fame.In 1994,[12]director James Cameron wrote an 80-pagetreatmentforAvatar, drawing inspiration from science fiction books he had read in his childhood, as well as fromadventure novelsbyEdgar Rice BurroughsandH. Rider Haggard.[11]Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old. He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic trees, fan lizards, a river with bioluminescent particles and a purple moss that lit up when stepped on. When he woke up, he made a drawing of the scene and later used it in the movie.[62]In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completingTitanic, he would filmAvatar, which would make use of synthetic, orcomputer-generated, actors.[14]The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles ""who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world"".[63]Visual effects houseDigital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release.[13]However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in aBloomberg BusinessWeekcover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10 million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip forAvatar, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005.[64]In February 2006, Cameron revealed that his filmProject 880was ""a retooled version ofAvatar"", a film that he had tried to make years earlier,[65]citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated charactersGollum,King Kong, andDavy Jones.[11]Cameron had chosenAvatarover his projectBattle Angelafter completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.[66]DevelopmentFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the Na'vi, the film's aliens. TheNa'vi languagewas created byPaul Frommer, a linguist atUSC.[11]The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue'sphonemesincludeejective consonants(such as the ""kx"" in ""skxawng"") that are found inAmharic, and the initial ""ng"" that Cameron may have taken from theMāori language.[16]Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film'sset designersmet with Jodie S. Holt, professor ofplant physiologyatUniversity of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used bybotaniststo study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film.[67]From 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustratorWayne Barloweand renowned concept artistJordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,[68]often working together in the kitchen of Cameron'sMalibuhome.[69]In July 2006, Cameron announced that he would filmAvatarfor a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by February 2007.[70]The following August, the visual effects studioWeta Digitalsigned on to help Cameron produceAvatar.[71]Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joinedAvatarto help with the film's designs.[72]Production designfor the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on thefloraandfaunaof Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors.[73]In September 2006, Cameron was announced to be using his ownReality Camera Systemto film in 3D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception.[74]While these preparations were underway, Fox wavered in its commitment toAvatarbecause of cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture,Titanic. During the production ofTitanic, Cameron rewrote the script to streamline the plot by combining several characters' roles and offered to cut his fee if the film were a commercial disappointment.[64]Cameron installed atraffic lightwith the amber signal lit outside of co-producerJon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future.[64]Landau, who previously worked with Cameron as co-producer ofTitanic, first met Cameron in 1993 when they were involved in the production ofTrue Lies.[21]FollowingTrue Lies, Landau would leave his role as a Fox executive to work in Cameron's production companyLightstorm.[21]After Landau's death in July 2024, Cameron credited him for having a vital role in the production ofAvatar.[21]In mid-2006, Fox decisively declined to produce the film, so Cameron began shopping it around to other studios. He approachedWalt Disney Studios, showing hisproof of conceptto Disney CEOBob Iger, then-studio chairmanDick Cook, andAlan Bergman.[75][64]However, whenWalt Disney Picturesattempted to take over, Fox exercised itsright of first refusal.[64]In October 2006, Fox finally committed to makingAvatarafterIngenious Mediaagreed to back the film, reducing Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237 million budget.[64]After Fox acceptedAvatar, one skeptical Fox executive told Cameron and Landau, ""I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking youcando this ...""[76]External audioJames Cameron interviewed byF. X. Feeneyon writing Avatar.Interview[77]In December 2006, Cameron describedAvataras ""a futuristic tale set on a planet 200 years hence ... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling"".[78]The January 2007 press release described the film as ""an emotional journey of redemption and revolution"" and said the story is of ""a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich inbiodiversity, who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival"". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem ofphantasmagoricalplants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.[46]Estimates put the cost of the film at about $280–310 million to produce and an estimated $150 million for marketing, noting that about $30 million intax creditswould lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers.[17][18][19]A studio spokesperson said that the budget was ""$237 million, with $150 million for promotion, end of story.""[4]FilmingPrincipal photographyforAvatarbegan in April 2007 inLos AngelesandWellington. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. ""Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,"" Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.[79]The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3DFusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.[80]In January 2007, Fox had announced that3D filmingforAvatarwould be done at 24 frames per second, despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3D film requires a higherframe rateto makestrobingless noticeable.[81]According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditionalminiatures.[82]Motion-capture photography lasted 31 days at theHughes Aircraftstage inPlaya Vista, Los Angeles.[66][83]Live action photography began in October 2007 at Stone Street Studios inWellingtonand was scheduled to last 31 days.[84]More than a thousand people worked on the production.[83]In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film.[85]Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to theHawaiian tropical rainforests[86]to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.[85]During filming, Cameron made use of hisvirtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, ""It's like a big, powerfulgame engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50-to-1 scale.""[87]Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly.[88]Cameron described the system as a ""form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements"".[89]Cameron gave fellow directorsSteven SpielbergandPeter Jacksona chance to test the new technology.[78]Spielberg said, ""I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation ... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater.""[88]Spielberg andGeorge Lucaswere also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.[90]To film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a ""simulcam"" was used, a merger of the 3D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as inaugmented realityand shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.[85]Due to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed onlyplant-based(vegan) food to be served on set.[91]Eventually, Cameron stated that it was Jon Landau who was ""the heart of theAvatarfamily"" and ""the center of gravity of our little bubble universe.""[21]Visual effectsCameron pioneered a specially designed camera built into a 6-inch boom that allowed the facial expressions of the actors to be captured and digitally recorded for the animators to use later.[92]A number of innovativevisual effectstechniques were used during production. According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film.[13][14]The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using newmotion captureanimation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006.[87]Innovations include a new system for lighting massive areas like Pandora's jungle,[93]amotion-capture stageor ""volume"" six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling fullperformance capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually madeskull capsfitted with a tiny camera positioned in front of the actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers.[94]According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts.[95]Besides the performance capture data which were transferred directly to the computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance.[96]A technically challenging scene was near the end of the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them.[97]The lead visual effects company wasWeta DigitalinWellington, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film.[98]Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other side of the world, a newcloud computingandDigital Asset Management(DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially forAvatar, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing.[99]To renderAvatar, Weta used a 930 m2(10,000 sq ft)server farmmaking use of 4,000Hewlett-Packardservers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage runningUbuntuLinux,Grid Enginecluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers,Pixar'sRenderManand Pixar's Alfredqueue management system.[100][101][102][103]Therender farmoccupies the 193rd to 197th spots in theTOP500list of the world's most powerfulsupercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed byThe Foundryin cooperation with Weta.[104][105]Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over apetabyteof digital storage,[106]and each minute of the final footage forAvataroccupies 17.28gigabytesof storage.[107]It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film.[108]To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, includingIndustrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions.[109]Joe Letteriwas the film's visual effects general supervisor.[110]Music and soundtrackMain article:Avatar: Music from the Motion PictureJames Horner – ""Jake Enters His Avatar World""listen to a clip from the score of the 2009 filmAvatar.Problems playing this file? Seemedia help.ComposerJames Hornerscored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron afterAliensandTitanic.[111]Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in March 2008.[112]He also worked with Wanda Bryant, anethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race.[113]The first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009.[114]During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except forAvatarand reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, ""Avatarhas been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.""[115]Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate ""traditional"" score to drive the film.[85]British singerLeona Lewiswas chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called ""I See You"". An accompanying music video, directed byJake Nava, premiered December 15, 2009, on MySpace.[116]Themes and inspirationsMain article:Themes inAvatarAvataris primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context ofimperialism, anddeep ecology.[117]Cameron said his inspiration was ""every single science fiction book I read as a kid"" and that he wanted to update the style ofEdgar Rice Burroughs'John Carterseries.[11]He acknowledged thatAvatarshares themes with the filmsAt Play in the Fields of the Lord,The Emerald Forest, andPrincess Mononoke, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and withDances with Wolves, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against.[118][119]He also citedHayao Miyazaki'sanimefilms such asPrincess Mononokeas an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[119]In 2012, Cameron filed a 45-page legal declaration that intended to ""describe in great detail the
genesis of the ideas, themes, storylines, and images that came to beAvatar.""[120]In addition to historical events (such asEuropean colonization of the Americas), his life experiences and several of his unproduced projects, Cameron drew connections betweenAvatarand his previous films. He cited his script and concept art forXenogenesis, partially produced as a short film, as being the basis for many of the ideas and visual designs inAvatar. He stated thatAvatar's""concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force, and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes"" from his earlier films includingAliens,The Abyss,Rambo: First Blood Part II,The TerminatorandTerminator 2: Judgment Day. He specifically mentioned the ""water tentacle"" inThe Abyssas an example of an ""avatar"" that ""takes on the appearance of...an alien life form...in order to bridge the cultural gap and build trust.""[121]Cameron also cited a number of works by other creators as ""reference points and sources of inspiration"" forAvatar. These include two of his ""favorite"" films,2001: A Space Odyssey, where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, andLawrence of Arabia, where ""an outsider...encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders."" Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a ""synthetic avatar"" inside another world fromGeorge Henry Smith's short story ""In the Imagicon"" andArthur C. Clarke's novelThe City and the Stars. He said he learned of the term ""avatar"" by reading thecyberpunknovelsNeuromancerbyWilliam GibsonandIslands in the NetbyBruce Sterling. The idea of a ""world mind"" originated in the novelSolarisbyStanislaw Lem. Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with ""indigenous cultures"" as inspiring him, includingDances with Wolves,The Man Who Would Be King,The Mission,The Emerald Forest,Medicine Man,The Jungle BookandFernGully. He also cited as inspiration theJohn CarterandTarzanstories byEdgar Rice Burroughsand other adventure stories byRudyard KiplingandH. Rider Haggard.[121]In a 2007 interview withTimemagazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the termAvatar, to which he replied, ""It's an incarnation of one of theHindu godstaking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.""[10]Cameron also cited theJapanese cyberpunkmangaand animeGhost in the Shell, in terms of how humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies.[122][123]Jake's avatar and Neytiri. One of the inspirations for the look of the Na'vi came from a dream that Cameron's mother had told him about.[117]The look of the Na'vi – the humanoids indigenous to Pandora — was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work onAvatar. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet (4 m) tall, which he thought was ""kind of a cool image"".[117]Also he said, ""I just like blue. It's a good color ... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities,[124]which I like conceptually.""[125]He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of ""gorgeous"" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them.[117]For the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied astar-crossedlove theme, which he said was in the tradition ofRomeo and Juliet.[121]He acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his filmTitanic. An interviewer stated: ""Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.""[126]Cameron described Neytiri as his ""Pocahontas"", saying that his plotline followed the historical story of a ""white outsider [who] falls in love with the chief's daughter, who becomes his guide to the tribe and to their special bond with nature.""[121]Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists.[127]Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (WorthingtonandSaldana) felt the characters did. Cameron said the two actors ""had a great chemistry"" during filming.[126]Pandora's floating ""Hallelujah Mountains"" were inspired in part by the ChineseHuangshanmountains (pictured).[128]Zhangjiajie National Forest ParkFor the film's floating ""Hallelujah Mountains"", the designers drew inspiration from ""many different types of mountains, but mainly thekarst limestoneformations in China.""[129]According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired byHuangshan(also known as Yellow Mountain),Guilin,Zhangjiajie, among others around the world.[129]Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains.[130]To create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited theNobleClyde Boudreaux[131]oil platform in theGulf of Mexicoduring June 2007. They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealisticCGIduring post-production.[132]Cameron said that he wanted to make ""something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that"" but also have a conscience ""that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man"". He added that ""the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are"" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans ""represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future"".[133]Cameron acknowledges thatAvatarimplicitly criticizes the United States' role in theIraq Warand the impersonal nature ofmechanized warfarein general. In reference to the use of the term ""shock and awe"" in the film, Cameron said: ""We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.""[134]He said in later interviews, ""... I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled ...""[135]and, ""The film is definitely not anti-American.""[136]A scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to theSeptember 11 attackson theWorld Trade Center, Cameron said he had been ""surprised at how much it did look like September 11"".[134]In July 2024, Cameron stated the film ""resembled theManhattan Project... making up new physics as we went along. Mastering a brand new methodology to tell stories.""[21]Cameron also acknowledged that it was actually film co-producer Jon Landau who was ""the heart of theAvatarfamily.""[21]MarketingPromotionsCameron promoting the film at the 2009San Diego Comic-ConThe first photo of the film was released on August 14, 2009,[137]andEmpirereleased exclusive images from the film in its October issue.[138]Cameron, producerJon Landau,Zoe Saldana,Stephen Lang, andSigourney Weaverappeared at a panel, moderated byTom Rothman, at the 2009San Diego Comic-Conon July 23.

The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles and cans ofCoca-Cola Zero, when held in front of a webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology.[152]The film was heavily promoted in an episode of theFoxseriesBonesin the episode ""The Gamer In The Grease"" (Season 5, Episode 9).AvatarstarJoel David Moorehas a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film.[153]A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film onAdult Swim, when she was interviewed by an animatedSpace Ghost.[154]McDonald'shad a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called ""Avatarize yourself"", which encouraged people to go to the website set up byOddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.[155]BooksAvatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora, a 224-page book in the form of a field guide to the film's fictional setting of the planet of Pandora, was released byHarper Entertainmenton November 24, 2009.[156]It is presented as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison.

It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theaters.[274]On January 31 it became the first film to gross over $2 billion worldwide,[275]and it became the first film to gross over $700 million in the United States and Canada, on February 27, after 72 days of release.[276]It remained at number one at the domestic box office for seven consecutive weeks – the most consecutive No. 1 weekends sinceTitanicspent 15 weekends at No.1 in 1997 and 1998[277]– and also spent 11 consecutive weekends at the top of the box office outside the United States and Canada, breaking the record of nine consecutive weekends set byPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.[278]By the end of its first theatrical releaseAvatarhad grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,999,298,189 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2,749,064,328.[5]Including the revenue from a re-release ofAvatarfeaturing extended footage,Avatargrossed $785,221,649 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,137,696,265 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,922,917,914.[5]Avatarhas set a number of box office records during its release: on January 25, 2010, it surpassedTitanic's worldwide gross to become thehighest-grossing film of all time worldwide41 days after its international release,[279][280][281]just two days after taking the foreign box office record.[282]On February 2, 47 days after its domestic release,AvatarsurpassedTitanicto become thehighest-grossing film of all timein Canada and the United States.[283]It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries[284][285][286][287][288][289]and is the first film to gross over $2 billion in foreign box office receipts.[290]IMAX ticket sales account for $243.3 million of its worldwide gross,[291]more than double the previous record.[292]By 2022, this figure rose to $268.6 million.[293]Box Office Mojoestimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices,Avatarwould be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America.[294]Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact onAvatar's gross; it estimated, on April 21, 2010, thatAvatarhad sold approximately 75 million tickets in North American theaters, more than any other film since 1999'sStar Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.[295]On a worldwide basis, whenAvatar's gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days into its run,The Daily Telegraphestimated its gross was surpassed by onlyGone with the Wind($3.0 billion),Titanic($2.9 billion), andStar Wars($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices,[296]withAvatarultimately winding up with $2.92 billion after subsequent re-releases.[5]Reuterseven placed it ahead ofTitanicafter adjusting the global total for inflation.[297]The 2015 edition ofGuinness World Recordslists Avatar only behindGone with the Windin terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.[298][299]Commercial analysisBefore its release, various film critics andfan communitiespredicted the film would be asignificant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbusterTitanic.[300][301][302]This criticism ranged fromAvatar's film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D ""blue cat people"".[300][301]Slatemagazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from theStar Warsprequel films and for having the ""uncanny valley"" effect.[303]The New York Timesnoted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to releaseAlvin and the Chipmunks: The SqueakquelalongsideAvatar, calling it a ""secret weapon"" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office.[304]I think if everybody was embracing the film before the fact, the film could never live up to that expectation ... Have them go with some sense of wanting to find the answer.James Cameron on criticism ofAvatarbefore its release.[301]Box office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success.[300][305]""The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived,"" said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. ""This is why all these 3-D venues were built: forAvatar.This is the one. The behemoth.""[305]The ""cautionary estimate"" was thatAvatarwould bring in around $60 million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher.[305][306]There were also analysts who believed that the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful.[300]Cameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. ""It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants,"" he stated. ""We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment.""[301]Although he feltAvatarwould appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a targetdemographic,[301]he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: ""If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience.""[307]Cameron was aware of the sentiment thatAvatarwould need significant ""repeat business"" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believedAvatarcould inspire the same ""sharing"" reaction asTitanic. He said that film worked because, ""When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life.""[301]After the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassingTitanic's worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts.[308]Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassingTitanic, such as 2008'sThe Dark Knight,[309]butAvatarwas considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings[308]did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. ""Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. ""This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation.""[310]Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassingTitanicbecause ""Today's films flame out much faster than they did whenTitanicwas released.""[310]Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, ""WhileAvatarmay beatTitanic's record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpassTitanicin attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.""[310]Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to ""try to toppleTitanicoff its perch"" because it ""just struck some kind of chord"" and there had been other good films in recent years.[311]He changed his prediction by mid-January. ""It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,"" he said.[312]You've got to compete head on with these other epic works of fantasy and fiction, theTolkiensand theStar Warsand theStar Treks. People want a persistent alternate reality to invest themselves in and they want the detail that makes it rich and worth their time. They want to live somewhere else. LikePandora.James Cameron on the success ofAvatar[313]Although analysts have been unable to agree thatAvatar's success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically ""the dumping ground for the year's weakest films"", and this also applied to 2010.[314]Cameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January.[301]Titaniccapitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998.[314]Additionally,Avatarestablished itself as a ""must-see"" event. Gray said, ""At this point, people who are going to seeAvatarare going to seeAvatarand would even if the slate was strong.""[314]Marketing the film as a ""novelty factor"" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theaters. ""It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home,"" stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com.[314]The ""Oscarbuzz"" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. ""Two-thirds ofTitanic's haul was earned overseas, andAvatar[tracked] similarly ...Avataropened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them"", and the markets ""such as Russia, whereTitanicsaw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today"" with ""more screens and moviegoers"" than before.[314]According toVariety, films in 3D accumulated $1.3 billion in 2009, ""a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross"". The increased ticket price – an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets – helped the film.[314]Likewise,Entertainment Weeklyattributed the film's success to 3D glasses but also to its ""astronomicword-of-mouth"". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but ""the buzz"" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.[315]Gray saidAvatarhaving no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. ""The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,"" he said, ""but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films:Titanic(historical events), theStar Warsmovies (an established film franchise), orThe Lord of the Rings(literature). It was a tougher sell ...""[314]The Hollywood Reporterestimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of between $387 million and $437 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.2 billion.[316]AccoladesMain article:List of accolades received byAvatarAvatarwon the82nd Academy AwardsforBest Art Direction,Best Cinematography, andBest Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, includingBest PictureandBest Director.[317]Avataralso won the67th Golden Globe AwardsforBest Motion Picture – DramaandBest Director, and was nominated for two others.[318]At the36th Saturn Awards,Avatarwon all ten awards it was nominated for:Best Science Fiction Film,Best Actor,Best Actress,Best Supporting Actor,Best Supporting Actress,Best Director,Best Writing,Best Music,Best Production DesignandBest Special Effects.TheNew York Film Critics Onlinehonored the film with its Best Picture award.[319]The film also won theCritics' Choice Awardsof theBroadcast Film Critics Associationfor Best Action Film and several technical categories, out of nine nominations.[320]It won two of the St. Louis Film Critics awards: Best Visual Effects and Most Original, Innovative or Creative Film.[321]The film also won theBritish Academy of Film and Television Arts(BAFTA) award for Production Design and Special Visual Effects, and was nominated for six others, including Best Film and Director.[322]The film has received numerous other major awards, nominations and honors.LegacyDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questionedAvatar's cultural impact.[d]In 2014, Scott Mendelson ofForbessaid the film had been ""all but forgotten"", citing the lack of merchandising, afandomfor the film, or any long-enduring media franchise, and further stated that he believed most general audiences could not remember any of the film's details, such as the names of its characters or actors in the cast. Mendelson arguedAvatar's only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema. Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, ""A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.""[323]He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, ""The very things that madeAvatarsometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence. It was just a movie, an original auteur-specific movie that prioritized top-shelf filmmaking and clockwork plotting over quotable dialogue and memes.""[329]Some have questioned if there is an audience for the film's planned sequels, believing there to be a lack of interest in the face of the multiple delays of their release dates.[326][327][330]Writing forThe Escapist, Darren Mooney acknowledged that the film had not been broadly remembered in the pop cultural subconscious and had not found a fandom in the same sense as many other popular media, but argued that this was not a negative point, saying, ""its defining legacy is the insistence that it lacks a legacy.""[331]In 2022, in response to the trailer forAvatar'supcoming sequelandthe film's re-release, journalists again questioned the cultural relevance of the film, particularly Patrick Ryan ofUSA Today, who said the film had ""curiously left almost no pop-culture footprint"".[332][333]In contrast, Bilge Ebiri ofVulturecalled others' opinions that the film had left no cultural impact ""narrow-minded"" and said that the film still held up well.[334]A detailed overview of theAvatarfranchise was reported inThe New York Timesin December of that year.[335]SequelsMain articles:Avatar: The Way of Water,Avatar: Fire and Ash,Avatar 4, andAvatar 5See also:Avatar(franchise)Avatar'ssuccess led to two sequels; this number was subsequently expanded to four.[336]Avatar: The Way of Water(2022) grossed over $2.3 billion, becoming thehighest-grossing film of 2022,[337]and received a similarly positive critical and audience response.[338]It will be followed byAvatar: Fire and Ash(2025). ThefourthandfifthAvatarfilms are scheduled to be released in 2029 and 2031.[336][339]Related mediaStage adaptationMain article:Toruk – The First FlightToruk – The First Flightis an original stage production by theMontreal-basedCirque du Soleilwhich ran between December 2015 and June 2019.

Stark and Rogers intervene, and Loki is imprisoned in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying base, theHelicarrier.The Avengers disagree on how to approach Loki and become argumentative once they realize S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to use the Tesseract to createweapons of mass destructionto use against extraterrestrial threats. During the argument, Loki's agents attack the Helicarrier, and Banner transforms into the Hulk in the chaos. Stark and Rogers restart the damaged engine while Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff subdues Barton, freeing him from Loki's control. Loki escapes after mortally wounding Coulson. Fury uses Coulson's subsequent death to motivate the Avengers to work together as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a generator Selvig built to open a portal aboveStark Towerin New York City, allowing his Chitauri fleet to invade.Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk work together to protect New York from the Chitauri. The Hulk incapacitates Loki while Romanoff learns from Selvig, now freed from Loki's mind control, that Loki's scepter can shut down the generator. Fury's superiors from theWorld Security Councilattempt to end the invasion by launching anuclear missileatMidtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and flies it toward the Chitauri fleet through the wormhole. The missile destroys the Chitauri mothership and disables their forces on Earth. Stark becomes unconscious, and his suit loses power, leaving himfree fallingtowards Earth. The Avengers manage to catch and resuscitate him, while Romanoff uses Loki's scepter to close the wormhole. In the aftermath, Thor transports an imprisoned Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face justice for his crimes.In amid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master[d]about the failed attack on Earth.CastThe cast ofThe AvengersalongsideJoss WhedonandKevin Feigeat the 2010San Diego Comic-Con.Robert Downey Jr.asTony Stark / Iron Man:A self-described genius, billionaire,playboy, andphilanthropistwho wears anelectromechanical suit of armorof his own invention. Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which includedIron Man 2(2010) andThe Avengers.[12]He initially suggested to Whedon that Stark should be the lead character, stating, ""Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.""[13]Downey commented on the character's evolution, stating, ""InIron Man, which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts.Iron Man 2is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . InThe Avengers, he's throwing it down with the others"".[14]Downey earned $50 million from the film, ""once box-office bonuses and backend compensation [were] factored in"".[15]Chris EvansasSteve Rogers / Captain America:AWorld War IIveteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, includingThe Avengers.[16]Rogers is depicted as darker inThe Avengers, with Evans stating, ""It's just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world.""[13]Evans also discussed the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, saying, ""I think there's certainly a dichotomy—this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun.""[17]Evans earned $2–3 million for the film.[15]Mark RuffaloasBruce Banner / Hulk:A genius scientist who, due to exposure togamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, initially considered for the role inThe Incredible Hulk(2008) beforeEdward Nortontook on the part,[18]was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton fell through.[19]Reflecting on replacing Norton, Ruffalo stated, ""I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation'sHamlet."" Discussing the character, he explained, ""He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself—the dark and the light—and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on theBill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities.""[20]Ruffalo described the Hulk's role on the team, stating, ""He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!'""[21]This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo expressed excitement about the prospect, saying, ""I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do theAvatarstop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun.""[22]The3D modelused to create the Hulk's body was based onLong Islandbodybuilderand male stripper Steve Romm, while Ruffalo's face served as the model for the Hulk's facial features.[23]To produce the Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was combined with those ofLou Ferrignoand others;[24]however, Ruffalo provided the Hulk's sole speaking line (""Puny god."") himself.[25]Ruffalo earned $2–3 million for his role in the film.[15]Chris HemsworthasThor:Thecrown princeofAsgard, based on theNorse mythologicaldeityof the same name. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal.[26]He had previously collaborated with Joss Whedon onThe Cabin in the Woods(2011).[27]Hemsworth maintained his physique fromThor(2011) by consuming a high-protein diet consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs daily. When asked about the quantity, he humorously replied, ""My body weight in protein pretty much!""[28]Thor's motivation inThe Avengersis described by Hemsworth as personal, as it involves his brother's disruptive actions. He explained, ""It's much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . . I've been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I'm the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There's a bit of that.""[13]Hemsworth earned $2–3 million for his role in the film.[15]Scarlett JohanssonasNatasha Romanoff / Black Widow:A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D.[29]Johansson discussed her character's relationship with Hawkeye, stating, ""Our characters have a long history. They've fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We're the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors – we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She's not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She's there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal.""[14]Regarding her training for the role, Johansson mentioned, ""Even thoughIron Man 2was 'one-for-them,' I'd never done anything like that before. I'd never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. ForThe Avengers, I've spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it's crazy. I do nothing but fight—all the time.""[30]Johansson earned $4–6 million for her portrayal in the film.[15]Jeremy RennerasClint Barton / Hawkeye:A masterarcherworking as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D.[31][32]Renner prepared for the physically demanding role by training extensively and practicing archery.[33]He expressed his appreciation for Hawkeye's character, stating, ""When I sawIron Man, I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn't really a superhero; he's just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that.""[14]Regarding Hawkeye's relationship with Natasha Romanoff, Renner explained, ""It's a lonely game. He's an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett's character, Natasha. It's like a left hand/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission.""[14]Renner emphasized that Hawkeye is confident in his abilities and not insecure about his humanity, stating, ""Quite the opposite, he's the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his [tranquilizer-tipped] arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero.""[13]Renner earned $2–3 million for his role in the film.[15]Tom HiddlestonasLoki:Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the Norse mythological deityof the same name.[26]Hiddleston reflected on his character's evolution from the filmThor, stating, ""I think the Loki we see inThe Avengersis further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up inThe Avengers, he's seen a few things.""[34]Regarding Loki's motivations, Hiddleston explained, ""At the beginning ofThe Avengers, he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven't let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation.""[35]Stellan SkarsgårdasErik Selvig:An astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki's control who is studying the Tesseract's power.[36][37]Skarsgård commented on Loki's control over Selvig, stating, ""Well with the scene we did inThor, it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik's mind. And inAvengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik's mind.""[37]Regarding his role, he added, ""[My character] is of importance but the size of the role is not big.""[37]Samuel L. JacksonasNick Fury:The director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the ""Avengers Initiative"". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films.[38]Jackson expressed that he has a more significant role inThe Avengerscompared to previous films: ""You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me"". Reflecting on the role, Jackson stated, ""It's always good to play somebody [who] is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem."" He likened the character to Ordell Robbie inJackie Brown, describing him as ""a nice guy to hang out with. You just don't want to cross him"".[39]Jackson earned $4–6 million for the film.[15]Clark Greggappears asPhil Coulson, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent overseeing many of the division's field operations.[40]Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel.[41]He noted that his role was expanded inThe Avengers, expressing: ""[What] Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn't the real script. But it wasn't, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years.""[42]Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character's backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America.[42]Cobie Smuldersappears asMaria Hill, a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent working closely with Nick Fury.[43]Smulders, initially considered by Whedon for hisunproduced live-action Wonder Woman film, was selected from a short list of potential actresses includingMorena Baccarin. Her deal integrated her into nine films.[44][45]Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, ""I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don't do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn't offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to.""[46]On relating to the character, Smulders said, ""I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We're asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going.""[47]Gwyneth PaltrowandMaximiliano Hernándezreprise their roles asPepper PottsandJasper Sitwell, respectively, from previous MCU films.[48]Paul Bettanyreturns to voiceJ.A.R.V.I.S.[48]Frequent Whedon collaboratorAlexis Denisofportrays ""the Other"", whileDamion Poitierportrays his master,Thanos(unnamed in the film), in a post-credits scene.[49]Powers BootheandJenny Agutterappear as members of the World Security Council, later revealed to beGideon Malickand CouncilwomanHawley.[50][51]Avengers co-creatorStan Leemakes a cameo appearance in a news report.[52]Additionally,Harry Dean Stantoncameos as a security guard, and Polish film directorJerzy Skolimowskiappears asGeorgi Luchkov, Romanoff's interrogator.[53]Warren Kolehas a brief role as a S.H.I.E.L.D. bridge tech who is caught playingGalaga.[54]Enver GjokajandAshley Johnson, the former who would later playDaniel Sousain the seriesAgent Carter(2015–2016), appear as a police officer and a waitress named Beth, respectively.[55][56]ProductionDevelopment""It goes back to the very first incarnation of The Avengers, it goes toThe Ultimates, it goes to everything about it. It makes no sense, it's ridiculous. There's a thunder god, there's a green 'id' giant rage monster, there's Captain America from the 40s, there's Tony Stark who definitely doesn't get along with anybody. Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. Obviously this will be expressed through punching but it will be the heart of the film.""—Joss Whedon, director ofThe Avengers, about the film.[57]Ideas for a film based on theAvengersbegan in 2003,[58]withAvi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying withMerrill Lynchto produce a slate of films that would be distributed byParamount Pictures.[59]Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation toWall Streetanalysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them before merging the characters together in acrossoverfilm.[60]ScreenwriterZak Penn, who wroteThe Incredible Hulk, became attached to the film in 2006,[58]and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007.[61]In the wake of the2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with theWriters Guild of Americato ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America,Ant-Man, and The Avengers.[62]After the successful release ofIron Man(2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date forThe Avengers.[63]In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.[64]Casting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing.[12]AlthoughDon Cheadlewas reported to reprise hisIron Man 2role ofWar MachineforThe Avengers, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film.[12][65]Simultaneously, two major developments occurred for Marvel:Jon Favreauwas brought in as an executive producer for the film,[12]and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—Iron Man 2,Thor, andCaptain America: The First Avenger(2011)—at theirManhattan Beach, Californiacomplex.[66]In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury inIron Man 2and other films.[38]In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner inThe Incredible Hulk, stated he was open to returning in the film.[67]The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated he would not direct the film but would ""definitely have input and a say"". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, ""It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then withAvengers,you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor [...] [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created"".[68]In March 2009, Scarlett Johansson replacedEmily Bluntin portraying Natasha Romanoff inIron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her toThe Avengers.[29]The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later.[69]Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.[26]In July 2009, Penn discussed the crossover process, stating, ""My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we're mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There's just a board that tracks 'Here's where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'. . . I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we're all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority"".[70]Initially, Penn attempted to reduce Thor's role in the script due to doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film. However, he changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor.[71]Although the film always intended to use Loki as its villain, Penn noted that early discussions had considered usingRed Skull.[72]In January 2010, Marvel Studios chiefKevin Feigewas asked if it would be challenging to blend the fantasy ofThorwith the high-tech science fiction inIron ManandThe Avengers. ""No,"" he said, ""because we're doing theJack Kirby/Stan Lee/Walt Simonson/J. Michael StraczynskiThor. We're not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-libraryThor. And in theThorof the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about teaching people that"".[73]In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chiefJoe QuesadaandAvengerscomic-book writerBrian Michael Bendishad received copies.[74]Also in March, Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films includingThe Avengers.[16]Pre-production""People forget that we started filmingAvengersbefore eitherThororCaptain Americawere released. What if people hatedThor? What if people thoughtLokiwas ridiculous? What if people didn't buy thissuper soldier frozen in ice? We were in the first quarter of production on a giant movie at that time, and we weren't going to stop. It was sort of all in at that point.""—Kevin Feige, President of Production for Marvel Studios, on the challenges of producing the firstAvengersfilm.[75]By April 2010,Joss Whedonwas nearing the completion of a deal to direct the film and to revise Penn's script,[76]and was officially announced in July 2010.[77]Regarding the hiring, Arad stated: ""My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer [...] It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it [...] I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better"".[78]Feige added, ""I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it [...] we want[ed] to find a director that's on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is.""[79]Whedon stated at the 2010San Diego Comic-Conthat what drew him to the film is that he loves how ""these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family"".[80]When Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not ""have anything"" and they should ""pretend this draft never happened"".[81]Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin ""at square one"".[58]Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film and created the tagline ""Avengers: Some Assembly Required"", riffing on the ""Avengers Assemble"" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and that he get the film done for its May 2012 release.[81]The script went through ""a lot of insane iterations of what might be"", according to Whedon. There was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he ""wrote a huge bunch of pages starringThe Wasp"",[58]and wantedZooey Deschanelto play the character.[82]He also was ""worried that one British character actor [(Hiddleston)] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft withEzekiel Stane,Obadiah Stane's son, in it."" Once all of the actors were ""locked in place the movie stayed on mission."" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike theX-Men. He felt ""these guys just don't belong together"" before realizing their interactions could be likeThe Dirty Dozen(1967). Whedon also referencedDr. Strangelove(1964),The Abyss(1989),His Girl Friday(1940), andBlack Hawk Down(2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he ""fought"" for sole credit and was ""very upset about it."" Penn felt the two ""could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.""[58]Joss Whedon at the 2010San Diego Comic-ConThe casting process continued throughout much of 2010, with the additions ofJeremy Renner,[31]Mark Ruffalo,[19]andClark Gregg.[40]Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to bring back.[83]""We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner inThe Avengers,"" stated Feige. ""Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members.The Avengersdemands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks.""[84]In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it ""purposefully misleading"" and an ""inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light"".[85]In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he ""wanted more diversity"" with his career and did not want to be associated with only one character.[86]In August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February.[87]In October 2010,Grumman StudiosinBethpage, New York[88]and theSteiner StudiosinBrooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations,[89]with set construction slated to begin in November,[88]but as Whedon later explained, ""Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque.""[5]Also that October,Walt Disney Studiosagreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights toIron Man 3(2013) andThe Avengers.[90]The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8 percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company'sproduction logoon marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads ""Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures"", though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount'sEpixretained pay TV rights.[7]In December 2010, Governor of New MexicoBill Richardsonand Marvel Studios Co-presidentLouis D'Espositoannounced thatThe Avengerswould primarily film inAlbuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also slated to be shot in Michigan,[91]but plans to film inDetroitwere scrapped after GovernorRick Snyderproposed a budget that would eliminate a film tax incentive.[92]Three months later, in March, Governor of OhioJohn Kasichannounced during MayorFrank G. Jackson's State of the City address thatThe Avengerswould also film inCleveland.[93]Concept illustrator and designer of Iron Man's Mark VII armor, Phil Saunders, stated that ""Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the 'cool' factor of the suitcase suit [fromIron Man 2], while still being a fully armored, heavy-duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle."" To achieve this, Saunders combined ideas proposed inIron Man 2with some concepts abandoned in the firstIron Manfilm, creating a modular suit featuring large ammo packets on the arms and a backpack.[94]Additionally, theScience & Entertainment Exchangeprovided science consultation for the film.[95]Casting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, Cobie Smulders was cast in the role of Maria Hill,[45]after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, whom Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury's sidekick.Morena Baccarin,Jessica Lucas, andMary Elizabeth Winsteadwere also considered for the role.[44]Over the successive months, the film's cast expanded to includeStellan Skarsgård,[36]Paul Bettany,[96]and Gwyneth Paltrow.[97]Paltrow was cast at Downey's insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes' individual films, commenting, ""You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team.""[98]FilmingPart ofThe Avengersfilm set on East 9th Street inCleveland, OhioPart ofThe Avengersfilm set onPark Avenuein New York CityPrincipal photographybegan on April 25, 2011, atAlbuquerque Studiosin Albuquerque, New Mexico,[99][91]with theworking titleGroup Hug.[100]In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald sustained a head injury while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after being struck by an arrow. Despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and resumed work on set, as confirmed by a Marvel spokesperson toTMZ.[101]Second unitfilming occurred in theButler area, about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the following month.[102]Additionally, a chase sequence was shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania, atCreekside Mushroom Farms, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.[103]Production shifted to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming spanned four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was selected as a stand-in for New York City's42nd Street, serving as the backdrop for climactic battle scenes.[104]Army Reservesoldiers from the391st Military Police Battalion, based inColumbus, Ohio, participated in the background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis noted that the involvement of real soldiers enhanced the realism of the scenes and portrayed the military positively, citing their ability to provide on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms.[105]TheNASA Plum Brook StationnearSandusky, Ohio, specifically itsSpace Power Facility, doubled as a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility.[106]Filming also occurred at theChevroletpowertrain plant inParma, Ohio, where a series of explosions were captured for the battle sequence originating in Cleveland.[107]Additional scenes were shot atPublic Squareand theDetroit–Superior Bridge,[108]with Public Square's southwest quadrant transformed into Stuttgart, Germany for filming.[109]Principal photography concluded in New York City, where filming took place over a span of two days.[110]Filming locations includedPark AvenueandCentral Park.[111][112]To capture scenes set in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison spent over three days shooting aerial footage to use as background plates. Morrison emphasized the importance of incorporating real imagery into the effects work to enhance realism, stating, ""There is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.""[113]CinematographerSeamus McGarveyexplained that he chose a 1.85:1aspect ratioto accommodate the varying heights of the main characters. He said, ""Shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [Whedon] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important."" This film marked McGarvey's first experience using a digital camera, specifically theArri Alexa.[114]Additionally, theCanon EOS 5D Mark IIandCanon EOS 7Ddigital SLR cameraswere employed for certain shots,[115][116][117]whilehigh-speedshots were captured on35 mm filmusing theArriflex 435. McGarvey emphasized a visual approach focused on immersion and naturalism, stating, ""Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.""[114]Post-productionIn December 2011, Disney announced the film would undergo aconversion to 3D.[118]According to Whedon, ""I'm not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years."" Whedon also noted, ""there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D"", but stated, ""The Avengersisn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway.""[119]In January 2012, it was reported that the film would undergo digital remastering forIMAX 3Dand would open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day as its regular theater release. This IMAX release followed Marvel's earlier IMAX releases ofIron Man 2andThor.[120]WhenThe Avengerswas initially submitted to theMotion Picture Association of America's rating board, the film received anR ratingdue to Phil Coulson's death scene. The scene was subsequently edited to secure a PG-13 rating.[121]In a May 2012 interview, Whedon revealed that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, even though the character is not identified in the film. ""He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love withDeathand I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [comic book] wasAvengers Annual#7 (1977) thatJim Starlindid followed byMarvel Two-in-One Annual#2 (1977) that contained the death ofAdam Warlock. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'""[122]Additionally, an extra scene featuring the Avengers enjoyingshawarmawas filmed on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw during the scene to conceal the beard he had grown.[123]Following the film's release, shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly saw a significant surge.[124][125][126]Whedon explained that the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the aftermath of filming a scene in theAngelepisode ""A Hole in the World"" whereFreddies inWesley's arms. After filming, Whedon, along with actorsAmy Ackerand Denisof, who played Fred and Wesley respectively, ""went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events"", an experience that Whedon recreated in the film's scene.[127]Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk (bottom) wearing amotion capturesuit and prosthetics on his upper half to emulate the Hulk's size[128]The film features over 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies:Industrial Light & Magic(ILM),Weta Digital,Scanline VFX,Hydraulx, Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures,Luma Pictures,Cantina Creative, Trixter,Modus FX, Whiskytree,Digital Domain, The Third Floor, and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man, and the Hulk. To bring the Hulk to life on screen, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set alongside the other actors, while four motion-capture HD cameras (two capturing his full body and two focused on his face) recorded his facial and body movements.[129]Jeff White, ILM's visual effects supervisor, aimed for a more realistic depiction of the Hulk compared to the one seen inAng Lee's2003 film, stating, ""We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.""[130]ILM digitally recreated the majority of the New York cityscape featured in the film, covering approximately ten city blocks by four city blocks. To accomplish this, ILM dispatched a team of four photographers for an eight-week shoot to capture images of the area.[129]Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager for the film, played a crucial role in securing the rights to nearly every building's likeness needed by ILM.[58]Initially, there were plans to includeOsCorpTower fromThe Amazing Spider-Man(2012) in the film, as Disney andSony Pictureshad agreed to it. However, this idea was abandoned because much of the skyline had already been finalized.[131]Weta Digital assumed responsibility for animating Iron Man during the forest duel, taking over from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, explained, ""We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.""[130]Williams highlighted that the most challenging aspect was reproducing Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.[129]Scanline VFX handled the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from Black Widow and Captain America's arrival on the carrier deck to its lift-off. Evil Eye Pictures integrated digital backgrounds into greenscreen footage for scenes set inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause from Hydraulx mentioned their contribution, stating, ""We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space"", covering Loki's arrival on Earth and his subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures focused on the Helicarrier's bridge shots and integrated the graphic monitor displays developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX handled shots in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain crafted the asteroid environment where Loki encounters The Other.[129]Method Design, based in Los Angeles, was responsible for the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, described it as ""a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG"". He explained that they designed, modeled, textured, and lit all environments and many foreground objects for each shot. Assets from Marvel were modified extensively to create a post-battle macro sequence. Method Design also crafted a custom typeface for the main title ofThe Avengersas well as 30 in-scene credits.[130]MusicFurther information:The Avengers(soundtrack)In November 2011, Marvel announced thatAlan Silvestri, who scoredCaptain America: The First Avenger, would compose the score forThe Avengers. Silvestri commented on the challenge of the project, stating, ""I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.""[132]Silvestri collaborated with theLondon Symphony OrchestraatAbbey Road Studiosin London, England to develop the score.[133]Whedon praised Silvestri's approach, stating, ""The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [Hans Zimmer] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.""[133]In March 2012, the Indian rock bandAgneereleased a music video for their single ""Hello Andheron"", serving as the theme song for the Indian release of the film.[134]Hollywood Recordsreleased the soundtrackconcept albuminspired by the film, titledAvengers Assemble, on May 1, 2012, coinciding with the release of the score.[135]MarketingTrailersThe film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, featuring a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L. Jackson followed by an introduction of the cast.[40]In June 2011, Marvel Studios announced that it would not hold a panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con, as studio executives felt unprepared to meet their own past achievements and fan expectations with filming still in production.[136]Subsequently, in July 2011, a teaser trailer intended as the post-credits scene ofCaptain America: The First Avengerbriefly leaked online.Entertainment Weeklyspeculated that it originated from a preview screening, describing the footage as ""shaky, fuzzy, flickering, and obviously filmed on a cell phone"".[137]Chris Evans, Tom Hiddleston, Cobie Smulders, and Clark Gregg promoting the film at the 2011New York Comic ConIn August 2011,Walt Disney Pictures,Pixar Animation Studios, and Marvel Studios presented a look atWalt Disney Studios' upcoming film slate, which includedThe Avengers, at theD23 ExpoinAnaheim, California.

Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines"".[141]However,The Hollywood Reportercalled it, ""Awesome. Or it would be if we hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer"".[142]The trailer, which debuted exclusively oniTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10 million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer.[143]This record was surpassed by the trailer forThe Dark Knight Rises(2012), which was downloaded more than 12.5 million times in its first 24 hours.[144]A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7 million downloads in 24 hours.[145]The theatrical trailers ofThe Avengersappeared with many films, includingMission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol(2011),21 Jump Street(2012), andThe Hunger Games(2012).[146]In January 2012, Marvel Studios hosted a global Twitter chat. The 30-minute live tweeting event featured writer/director Joss Whedon and cast members Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg, along with a 10-second tease of the 30-second commercial that would air duringSuper Bowl XLVIin February.[147]According to theLos Angeles Times, Disney paid an estimated $4 million for the 30-second spot.[148]On May 1, 2012, executives from Marvel Studios, along with actors Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg, rang the opening bell of theNew York Stock Exchangein honor of the film's theatrical release.[149]Tie-in comicsFurther information:Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comicsIn December 2011, Marvel announced the release of an eight-issue comic-book prelude to the film, penned byChristopher Yostand Eric Pearson with art byLuke Rossand Daniel HDR, for release in March 2012.[150]In February 2012, Marvel revealed plans for a second limited series comic book tie-in titledBlack Widow Strikes, written byFred Van Lente, who wroteCaptain America: First Vengeance, the comic-book prequel toCaptain America: The First Avenger.

An Acura spokesperson later confirmed the company's involvement with the film, stating, ""As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues forThe Avengers. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying the development of a new sportscar, but we can't say any more about it at this time.""[154]In December 2011, Acura announced that a newNSX, styled along the lines of theconceptbuilt forThe Avengers, would be unveiled at the 2012North American International Auto Show.[155]Additionally, a series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D.SUVs, based on theAcura MDXwith modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also created for the film.[156]In February 2012, Marvel announced a partnership with fragrance company JADS to promoteThe Avengerswith character-based fragrances.

Marvel and its parent company Disney secured an estimated $100 million in worldwide marketing support for the film. Notably absent from the promotional lineup wereBaskin-Robbins,Burger King, andDunkin' Donuts, which had partnered with Marvel in the past when their films were distributed by Paramount; Disney generally avoids promotions through fast food outlets.[158]Video gameAvideo game based on the filmwas initially planned for simultaneous release. It was intended to be a combination of afirst-person shooterand abrawlerfor theXbox 360,PlayStation 3,Wii U, andMicrosoft Windowsplatforms, withTHQas the publisher. The console versions were to be developed byTHQ Studio Australia, whileBlue Tongue Entertainmentwas tasked with creating thePCversion. However, after THQ shut down both studios, the game was ultimately canceled.[159]Consequently, the intellectual property rights for an Avengers video game reverted to Marvel, which stated that it was exploring potential publishing and licensing opportunities.[160]A mobile game published byGameloftwas released in May 2012.[161]In May 2012, a collaboration betweenUbisoftand Marvel Entertainment was revealed, unveiling their joint project: a motion-controlled game titledMarvel Avengers: Battle for Earthdesigned for the Wii U and Xbox 360Kinect.

This caused uncertainty over the film's actual title.Empiremagazine reported that the film would be titledMarvel Avengers Assemble,[164]whileThe Hollywood Reportersaid that it would be called simplyAvengers Assemble.[165]Marvel's UK website referred to it asMarvel's Avengers Assemble,[166]though David Cox ofThe Guardian, in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this a production notes error.[167]TheBritish Board of Film Classificationand theIrish Film Classification Officelisted it asMarvel Avengers Assemble.[1][6]Frank Lovecein FilmFestivalTraveler.com noted the discrepancy, observing that the film is formally titled ""Marvel's The Avengers"" on screen, despite the absence of an apostrophe on posters.[5]Feige explained the UK title's additional word, emphasizing the thorough decision-making process involved.[168]The film's world premiere took place on April 11, 2012, at Hollywood'sEl Capitan Theatre.[169]It closed the 11th AnnualTribeca Film Festivalwith a screening on April 28.[170]For the 2012 U.S.Labor Dayweekend, the film received an expanded one-week theatrical push, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700.[171]The Avengerswas the last film released inPhase Oneof the MCU.[172]Home mediaThe film was released byWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment[173][174]onBlu-ray Disc,Blu-ray 3D,DVD, anddigital downloadon September 25 in the United States and as early as August 29 in various international markets.[175][176]Feige mentioned that the Blu-ray version features a newMarvel One-ShottitledItem 47(2012), along with ""a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process"".

Unfortunately, another region's elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release"".[182]Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped theNielsen VideoScanFirst Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart.

But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again.""[255]ToRolling StonejournalistPeter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. ""It's also the blockbuster,"" Travers said, ""I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It'sTransformerswith a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor.""[256]Justin Chang ofVarietywrote, ""Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty, and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story.""[257]Kenneth Turanof theLos Angeles Timescomplimented the film's frenetic pace,[258]whileRoger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timescommented that it ""provides its fans with exactly what they desire.

ScottofThe New York Timesbelieved that ""whileThe Avengersis hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.""[260]The performances of several cast members were a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; stating, ""Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.""[261]Similarly,The New Yorker'sAnthony Laneproclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey.[262]The Village Voice'sKarina Longworthconcluded: ""Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.""[263]Travers asserted that the actor resonated a ""scruffy warmth and humor"" vibe,[256]while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton andEric Banain playing the character.[258]Owen Gleiberman ofEntertainment Weeklywrote that ""the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)""[264]Referring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein ofThe Wall Street Journal—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored his work inIron Manover his acting inThe Avengers: ""His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony.""[265]Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.[261]Commentators appreciated the character development and dialogue.Associated PressreviewerChristy Lemirewrote that the script ""sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they're well fleshed-out underneath.""[266]Scott suggested that certain parts of the film exuded a charm reminiscent of the western filmRio Bravo(1959).[260]Longworth felt that while Whedon's script delved into the backstory of the characters, the film did not explore it ""in a substantive way"".[263]AccoladesMain article:List of accolades received byThe Avengers(2012 film)At the85th Academy Awards,The Avengersreceived a nomination forBest Visual Effects.[267]The film's other nominations include twoAnnie Awards(winning one),[268]aBritish Academy Film Award,[269]and threeCritics' Choice Movie Awards.[270][271]In 2017, it was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time inEmpiremagazine's poll ofThe 100 Greatest Movies.[272]SequelsMain articles:Avengers: Age of Ultron,Avengers: Infinity War, andAvengers: EndgameFurther information:List of Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAvengers: Age of Ultron[273]was written and directed by Whedon,[274]and released on May 1, 2015.[275]The film features much of the original cast, alongside new additions includingElizabeth OlsenasScarlet Witch,Aaron Taylor-JohnsonasQuicksilver, Paul Bettany asVision, andJames SpaderasUltron.[276]Avengers: Infinity WarandAvengers: Endgamewere directed byAnthony and Joe Russo, with a script byChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.[277][278][279]Infinity Warwas released on April 27, 2018,[280]followed byEndgameon April 26, 2019.[279]The ensemble cast for both films includes returning actors from previous MCU entries, as well as new characters from other films in the franchise.[281]See also""What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?"", an episode of the MCU television seriesWhat If...?that reimagines some events of this filmNotes^abAs part of the deal transferring the distribution rights ofThe AvengersandIron Man 3(2013) fromParamount Picturesto theWalt Disney Studios,[7]Paramount's logo appears in the film's opening titles, promotional materials, and merchandise.[8]Nevertheless,Walt Disney Studios Motion Picturesis credited at the end of the film.^Norton portrayed Bruce Banner inThe Incredible Hulk(2008)^Producer Kevin Feige stated that the Tesseract is based on theCosmic Cubefrom the Marvel Comics.[9]AfterThor: The Dark World(2013), he stated that it was also theSpace Stone.[10]^Producer Kevin Feige confirmed that the ""master"" in the post-credits scene isThanos.[11]References^abc""Marvel Avengers Assemble"".British Board of Film Classification.

Jackson;Walton Goggins,Dennis Christopher,James Remar,Michael Parks, andDon Johnsonalso star in supporting roles. The film, set in theAntebellum SouthandAntebellum West, is a highly stylized, revisionist tribute tospaghetti Westerns. Its title refers particularly to the 1966 Italian filmDjangobySergio Corbucci(that film's star,Franco Nero, has acameo appearancein Tarantino's). The story follows a slave who trains under a Germanbounty hunterwith the ultimate goal of reuniting with his wife.Development ofDjango Unchainedbegan in 2007, when Tarantino was writing a book on Corbucci. By April 2011, Tarantino sent his final draft of the script toThe Weinstein Company(TWC). Casting began in the summer of 2011, withMichael K. WilliamsandWill Smithbeing considered for the role of the title character before Foxx was cast. Principal photography took place from November 2011 to March 2012 in California, Wyoming, and Louisiana.Django Unchainedpremiered at theZiegfeld Theatrein New York City on December 11, 2012, and was theatrically released by The Weinstein Company on December 25, in the United States, withSony Pictures Releasing Internationalhandling international distribution. It was a commercial success, grossing $426 million worldwide against a $100 million budget, becoming Tarantino's highest-grossing film to date. The film received acclaim from critics, who praised the performances (especially those of Waltz and DiCaprio) and Tarantino's direction and screenplay.The film's extensive graphic violence and frequent use of racial slurs were controversial. The film received numerousawards and nominations, winning two out of five nominations at the85th Academy Awards. Waltz won several awards for his performance, among themBest Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards,Golden GlobesandBAFTAs. For his screenplay, Tarantino won anAcademy Award, aGolden Globe, and aBAFTA.Plot[edit]In 1858 Texas, several male African Americanslavesare being 'driven' by the Speck Brothers, Ace and Dicky. Among the shackled slaves is Django, sold off and separated from his wife, Broomhilda. The Speck Brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German ex-dentist andbounty hunterfromDüsseldorf. Schultz asks to buy one of the slaves, but while questioning Django about his knowledge of the Brittle Brothers, for whom Schultz is carrying a warrant, he irritates Ace who aims his shotgun at Schultz. Schultz quickly kills Ace and leaves Dicky at the mercy of the other newly freed slaves, who kill him. Since Django can identify the Brittle Brothers, Schultz offers Django his freedom in exchange for his help in tracking them down.Django discovers Schultz is a bounty hunter, as Schultz kills an outlaw named Willard Peck, who was posing as a Sheriff in a small town. Schultz and Django then track the Brittle Brothers down, leading them to a plantation. Django shoots down the first brother, brutally whips the second before shooting him dead, while Schultz kills the third brother. Django partners with Schultz through the winter and becomes his apprentice. Schultz discovers Django's natural ability with a gun. Schultz explains that, being the first person he has ever given freedom to, he feels responsible for Django and is driven to help him in his quest to rescue Broomhilda.Django, now fully trained, collects his first bounty, keeping the handbill as a good luck charm. In Mississippi, Schultz uncovers the identity of Broomhilda's owner: Calvin Candie, the charming but brutal owner of the Candylandplantation, where slaves are forced to fight to the death in wrestling matches called ""Mandingofights."" Schultz, expecting Candie will not sell Broomhilda if they ask for her directly, plots to feign interest in purchasing one of Candie's prized fighters, offer to purchase Broomhilda on the side for a reasonable sum, then take her and escape before the Mandingo deal is finalized. Schultz and Django meet Candie at his gentleman's club inGreenvilleand submit their offer. His greed tickled, Candie invites them to Candyland. After secretly briefing Broomhilda on the plan, Schultz claims to be charmed by the German-speaking Broomhilda and offers to buy her after arranging to buy a fighting slave.During dinner, Candie'sstaunchly loyalhouse slave, Stephen, becomes suspicious. Deducing that Django and Broomhilda know each other and that the sale of the Mandingo fighter is just a misdirection, Stephen alerts and privately admonishes Candie on his greed. Candie is humiliated at being fooled by a black man, but he contains his anger long enough to theatrically display his knowledge ofphrenologywhich he uses to justify white superiority and black inferiority. Candie's bodyguard suddenly bursts into the room with his shotgun trained on the two bounty hunters, and Candie furiously threatening to kill Broomhilda. He extorts Schultz for the complete bid amount, and taunts him by demanding a formal handshake to finalize the deal before he leaves. Schultz fatally shoots Candie with a concealedderringerand his henchman kills him in turn. Django grabs a revolver and, after a shootout, is forced to surrender when Broomhilda is taken hostage at gunpoint.The next morning, Stephen tells Django that he will be sold to a mine where he will work for the rest of his life. En route to the mine, Django proves to his dim-witted Australian escorts that he is a bounty hunter by showing them the handbill from his first kill. He convinces them that there is a large bounty for outlaws who are hiding at Candyland, and promises that they would receive most of the money. The escorts release him and give him a pistol, and he kills them before stealing a horse and leaving for Candyland.Django returns to the plantation and kills more of Candie's henchmen. He takes Broomhilda's freedom papers from Schultz's pocket and frees her from a nearby cabin. When Candie's mourners return from his burial, Django kills Candie's few remaining henchmen and his sister Lara, releases the two remaining house slaves, and kneecaps Stephen. Django ignites dynamite that he has planted throughout the mansion. He and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the mansion explodes, killing Stephen, before riding off together.Cast[edit]Clockwise from top left:Jamie Foxx,Christoph Waltz,Samuel L.

He called this type of film ""a Southern"", stating that he wanted:""...to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like Spaghetti Westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to.""[8]Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea:I was writing a book aboutSergio Corbucciwhen I came up with a way to tell the story. ... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot withfascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [this] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking about it now. And I can do it!'[9]Tarantino finished the script on April 26, 2011, and handed in the final draft toThe Weinstein Company.[10]In October 2012, frequent Tarantino collaboratorRZAsaid that he and Tarantino had intended tocross overDjango Unchainedwith RZA's Tarantino-presented martial-arts filmThe Man with the Iron Fists.The crossover would have seen a younger version of the blacksmith character from RZA's film appear as a slave in an auction. However, scheduling conflicts prevented RZA's participation.[11]One inspiration for the film is Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti WesternDjango, whose starFranco Nerohas acameo appearanceinDjango Unchained.[12]Another inspiration is the 1975 filmMandingo, about a slave trained to fight other slaves.[13]Tarantino included scenes in the snow as a homage to the 1968 filmThe Great Silence.[14]""Silenziotakes place in the snow. I liked the action in the snow so much,Django Unchainedhas a big snow section in the middle,"" Tarantino said in an interview.[14]Tarantino credits the character and attitude of the German dentist turned bounty hunter King Schultz to the GermanKarl MayWild West films of the 1960s, namely their heroOld Shatterhand.[15]The titleDjango Unchainedalludes to the titles of the 1966 Corbucci filmDjango;Hercules Unchained, the American title for the 1959 Italian epic fantasy filmErcole e la regina di Lidia, about the mythical hero's escape from enslavement to a wicked master; and toAngel Unchained, the 1970 American biker film about a biker exacting revenge on a large group ofrednecks.[16][17]Casting[edit]Among those considered for the title role of Django,Michael K. WilliamsandWill Smithwere mentioned as possibilities, but in the endJamie Foxxwas cast in the role.[18][19]Smith later said he turned down the role because it ""wasn't the lead"" and was ""not for me,"" but stated he thought the movie was brilliant.[20]Tyrese Gibsonsent in an audition tape as the character.[21]Franco Nero, the original Django from the1966 Italian film, was rumored for the role of Calvin Candie,[22]but instead was given a cameo appearance as a minor character. Nero suggested that he play a mysterious horseman who haunts Django in visions and is revealed in an ending flashback to be Django's father; Tarantino opted not to use the idea.[23][24]Kevin Costnerwas in negotiations to join as Ace Woody,[25]a Mandingo trainer and Candie's right-hand man, but Costner dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.[26]Kurt Russellwas cast instead[27]but also later left the role.[28]When Kurt Russell dropped out, the role of Ace Woody was not recast; instead, the character was merged withWalton Goggins's character, Billy Crash.[29]Jonah Hillwas offered the role of Scotty Harmony, a gambler who loses Broomhilda to Candie in a poker game,[30]but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts withThe Watch.[31][32]Sacha Baron Cohenwas also offered the role, but declined in order to appear inLes Misérables. Neither Scotty nor the poker game appear in the final cut of the film.[30]Hill later appeared in the film in a different role.[33]Joseph Gordon-Levittsaid that he ""would have loved, loved to have"" been in the film but would be unable to appear because of a prior commitment to direct his first film,Don Jon.[34]Costume design[edit]Django's valet costume was inspired byThomas Gainsborough's oil painting,The Blue Boy(c.1770).In a January 2013 interview withVanity Fair, costume designerSharen Davissaid much of the film's wardrobe was inspired by spaghetti Westerns and other works of art. For Django's wardrobe, Davis and Tarantino watched the television seriesBonanzaand referred to it frequently. The pair even hired the hatmaker who designed the hat worn by theBonanzacharacter Little Joe, played byMichael Landon. Davis described Django's look as a ""rock-n-roll take on the character"". Django's sunglasses were inspired byCharles Bronson's character inThe White Buffalo(1977). Davis usedThomas Gainsboroughoil paintingThe Blue Boy(c.1770) as a reference for Django's valet outfit.[35]In the final scene, Broomhilda wears a dress similar to that ofIda Galli's character inBlood for a Silver Dollar(1965). Davis said the idea of Calvin Candie's costume came partly fromRhett Butler, and that Don Johnson's signatureMiami Vicelook inspired Big Daddy's cream-colored linen suit in the film. King Schultz's faux chinchilla coat was inspired byTelly SavalasinKojak. Davis also revealed that many of her costume ideas did not make the final cut of the film, leaving some unexplained characters such as Zoë Bell's tracker, who was intended to drop her bandana to reveal an absent jaw.[36]Filming[edit]Principal photographyforDjango Unchainedstarted in California in November 2011[37]continuing in Wyoming in February 2012[38]and at the National Historic LandmarkEvergreen PlantationinWallace, Louisiana, outside ofNew Orleans, in March 2012.[39]The film was shot in theanamorphic formaton35 mm film.[40]Although originally scripted, a sub-plot centering on Zoë Bell's masked tracker was cut, and remained unfilmed, due to time constraints.[41]After 130 shooting days, the film wrapped up principal photography in July 2012.[42]Kerry Washingtonsought to bring authenticity to her performance in several ways. The actor playing her overseer used a fake whip, but Washington insisted the lashings really hit her back. And to dramatize her punishment inside an underground, coffin-size metal container, she and Tarantino agreed she would spend time barely clothed in the ""hot box"" before the filming began so the feeling of confinement would be as realistic as possible.[43]Django Unchainedwas the first Tarantino film not edited bySally Menke, who died in 2010. Editing duties were instead handled byFred Raskin, who had worked as an assistant editor on Tarantino'sKill Bill.[44]Raskin was nominated for aBAFTA Award for Best Editingbut lost toWilliam Goldenbergfor his work onArgo.Broken glass incident[edit]During the scene when DiCaprio's character explainsphrenology, DiCaprio cut his left hand upon striking the table and smashing a small glass. Despite his hand profusely bleeding, DiCaprio barely reacted and remained in character under the astonished eyes of his fellow actors. He is seen taking out pieces of broken glass from his hand during the scene. After Tarantino's cut, there was a standing ovation by the other actors to praise DiCaprio's performance despite the incident;[45]Tarantino, therefore, decided to keep this sequence in the final cut. DiCaprio is seen with his left hand bandaged in the scene after when he is signing Broomhilda's papers. Contrary to popular belief, DiCaprio wiped fake blood on Washington's face in a separate take.[46]Music[edit]Main article:Django Unchained (soundtrack)The film features both original and existing music tracks. Tracks composed specifically for the film include ""100 Black Coffins"" byRick Rossand produced by and featuring Jamie Foxx, ""Who Did That To You?"" byJohn Legend, ""Ancora Qui"" byEnnio MorriconeandElisa, and ""Freedom"" byAnthony HamiltonandElayna Boynton.[47]The theme, ""Django"", was also the theme song of the 1966 film.[48]MusicianFrank Oceanwrote an original song for the film's soundtrack, but it was rejected by Tarantino, who explained that ""Ocean wrote a fantastic ballad that was truly lovely and poetic in every way, but there just wasn't a scene for it.""[49]Ocean later published the song, entitled ""Wiseman"", on hisTumblrblog. The film also features a few famous pieces ofwestern classical music, includingBeethoven's ""Für Elise"" and ""Dies Irae"" fromVerdi's Requiem. Tarantino has stated that he avoids using full scores of original music: ""I just don't like the idea of giving that much power to anybody on one of my movies.""[50][51]The film's soundtrack album was released on December 18, 2012.[47]Morricone made statements criticizing Tarantino's use of his music inDjango Unchainedand stated that he would ""never work"" with the director after this film,[52]but later agreed to compose an original film score for Tarantino'sThe Hateful Eightin 2015. In a scholarly essay on the film's music,Hollis Robbinsnotes that the vast majority of film music borrowings comes from films made between 1966 and 1974 and argues that the political and musical resonances of these allusions situateDjango Unchainedsquarely in the Vietnam and Watergate era, during the rise and decline of Black Power cinema.[53]Jim Croce's hit ""I Got a Name"" was featured in the soundtrack.Release[edit]Marketing[edit]The first teaser poster was inspired by a fan-art poster by Italian artist Federico Mancosu. His artwork was published in May 2011, a few days after the synopsis and the official title were released to the public. In August 2011, at Tarantino's request, the production companies bought the concept artwork from Mancosu to use for promotional purposes as well as on the crew passes and clothing for staff during filming.[54]Theatrical run[edit]Django Unchainedwas released on December 25, 2012, in the United States byThe Weinstein Companyand released on January 18, 2013, bySony Pictures Releasingin the United Kingdom.[55][56]The film was screened for the first time at theDirectors Guild of Americaon December 1, 2012, with additional screening events having been held for critics leading up to the film's wide release.[57]The premiere ofDjango Unchainedwas delayed by one week followingthe shootingat an elementary school inNewtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012.[58]The film was released on March 22, 2013, by Sony Pictures inIndia.[59]In March 2013,Django Unchainedwas announced to be the first Tarantino film approved for official distribution inChina'sstrictly controlledfilm market.[60]Lily Kuo, writing forQuartz, wrote that ""the film depicts one of America's darker periods, when slavery was legal, which Chinese officials like to use to push back against criticism from the United States"".[61]The film was released in China on May 12, 2013.[62]Home media[edit]The film was released onDVD,Blu-ray, and digital download on April 16, 2013.[63]In the United States, the film has grossed $31,939,733 from DVD sales and $30,286,838 from Blu-ray sales, making a total of $62,226,571.[64]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]Django Unchainedgrossed $162.8 million in the United States and Canada and $263.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $426 million, against a production budget of $100 million.[5]As of 2013[update],Django Unchainedis Tarantino's highest-grossing film, surpassing his previous film,Inglourious Basterds(2009), which grossed $321.4 million worldwide.[65]In North America, the film made $15 million on Christmas Day, finishing second behind fellow openerLes Misérables.[66]It was the third-biggest opening day figure for a film on Christmas, followingSherlock Holmes($24.6 million) andLes Misérables($18.1 million).[67]It went on to make $30.1 million in its opening weekend (a six-day total of $63.4 million), finishing second behind holdoverThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.[68]Critical response[edit]Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 296 reviews, and an average rating of 8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Bold, bloody, and stylistically daring,Django Unchainedis another incendiary masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino.""[69]Metacritic, which assigns a rating to reviews, gives the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[70]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale.[71]Roger Ebertof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film four stars out of four and said: ""The film offers one sensational sequence after another, all set around these two intriguing characters who seem opposites but share pragmatic, financial and personal issues."" Ebert also added, ""had I not been prevented from seeing it sooner because of an injury, this would have been on my year's best films list.""[72]Peter Bradshaw, film critic forThe Guardian, awarded the film five stars, writing: ""I can only sayDjangodelivers, wholesale, that particular narcotic and delirious pleasure that Tarantino still knows how to confect in the cinema, something to do with the manipulation of surfaces. It's as unwholesome, deplorable and delicious as a forbidden cigarette.""[13]Writing inThe New York Times, criticA. O. ScottcomparedDjangoto Tarantino's earlierInglourious Basterds: ""LikeInglourious Basterds,Django Unchainedis crazily entertaining, brazenly irresponsible and also ethically serious in a way that is entirely consistent with its playfulness."" Designating the film aTimes""critics"" pick, Scott saidDjangois ""a troubling and important movie about slavery and racism.""[73]FilmmakerMichael MoorepraisedDjango, tweeting that the movie ""is one of the best film satires ever.""[74]Dan Jolin ofEmpiremagazinepraised DiCaprio's performance, saying he ""plays [the role of Candie] to hateful perfection: a spiteful, brown-toothed bully, avaricious, vain and prone to flattery"", but criticized Foxx as a comparatively weak link whose ""soft, musical voice [...] jars against Django's terse deliveries"".[75]To the contrary,Owen Gleiberman, film critic for theEntertainment Weekly, wrote: ""Djangoisn't nearly the film thatInglouriouswas. It's less clever, and it doesn't have enough major characters – or enough of Tarantino's trademark structural ingenuity – to earn its two-hour-and-45-minute running time.""[76]In his review for theIndy Week, David Fellerath wrote: ""Django Unchainedshows signs that Tarantino did little research beyond repeated viewings of Sergio Corbucci's 1966 spaghetti WesternDjangoand a blaxploitation from 1975 calledBoss Nigger, written by and starringFred Williamson.""[77]New Yorker'sAnthony Lanewas ""disturbed by their [Tarantino's fans'] yelps of triumphant laughter, at the screening I attended, as a white woman was blown away by Django's guns.""[78]An entire issue of the academic journalSafundiwas devoted toDjango Unchainedin ""Django Unchained and the Global Western,"" featuring scholars who contextualize Tarantino's film as a classic ""Western"".[79]Dana Phillips writes: ""Tarantino's film is immensely entertaining, not despite but because it is so very audacious—even, at times, downright lurid, thanks to its treatment of slavery, race relations, and that staple of the Western, violence. No doubt these are matters that another director would have handled more delicately, and with less stylistic excess, than Tarantino, who has never been bashful. Another director also would have been less willing to proclaim his film the first in a new genre, the 'Southern'.""[80]Top ten lists[edit]Django Unchainedwas listed on many critics' top ten lists of 2012.[81]1st –Amy Nicholson,Movieline2nd –Mick LaSalle,San Francisco Chronicle2nd – Drew McWeeny,Hitfix2nd – Michelle Orange,The Village Voice2nd –Nathan Rabin,The A.V.

Tarantino won anAcademy Award for Best Original Screenplay.[83][84]Christoph Waltz received theAcademy Award for Best Supporting Actor, theGolden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor, and theBAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor, his second time receiving all three awards, having previously won for his role in Tarantino'sInglourious Basterds.[85][86][87]TheNAACP Image Awardsgave the film four nominations, while theNational Board of Reviewnamed DiCaprio theirBest Supporting Actor.[88][89]Django Unchainedearned a nomination forBest Theatrical Motion Picturefrom theProducers Guild of America.[90]Criticism[edit]Use of racial slurs and portrayal of slavery[edit]Some commentators thought that the film's over-usage of the word ""nigger"" was inappropriate; they objected to that even more than to the extensive violence depicted against the slaves.[91]Other reviewers[92]have defended the usage of the language in the historical context of race and slavery in the United States.[93]African American filmmakerSpike Lee, in an interview withVibe, said he would not see the film, explaining ""All I'm going to say is that it's disrespectful to my ancestors. That's just me ... I'm not speaking on behalf of anybody else.""[94]Lee later wrote, ""American slavery was not aSergio LeoneSpaghetti Western.It was a Holocaust. My ancestors are slaves stolen from Africa. I will honor them.""[95]Actor and activistJesse Williamshas contrasted accuracy of the racist language used in the film with what he sees as the film's lack of accuracy about the general lives of slaves, too often portrayed as ""well-dressed Negresses in flowing gowns, frolicking on swings and enjoying leisurely strolls through the grounds, as if the setting is Versailles, mixed in with occasional acts of barbarism against slaves ... That authenticity card that Tarantino uses to buy all those 'niggers' has an awfully selective memory.""[96]He also criticizes what seems to be a lack of solidarity among slave characters, and their general lack of a will to escape from slavery, with Django as the notable exception.[96]Wesley MorrisofThe Boston Globepraised the realism of the villain Stephen, played bySamuel L. Jackson, comparing him to such black Republicans asClarence ThomasorHerman Cain.[97]Jackson said that he believed his character to have ""the same moral compass as Clarence Thomas does"".[98]Jackson defended the extensive use of the word ""nigger"": ""Saying Tarantino said 'nigger' too many times is like complaining they said 'kyke' [sic] too many times in a movie about Nazis.""[99]The review by Jesse Williams notes, however, that these antisemitic terms were not used nearly as frequently in Tarantino's film about Nazis,Inglourious Basterds, as he used ""nigger"" inDjango. He suggested that the Jewish community would not have accepted it.[96]Writing in theLos Angeles Times, journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan noted the difference between Tarantino'sJackie BrownandDjango Unchained: ""It is an institution whose horrors need no exaggerating, yetDjangodoes exactly that, either to enlighten or entertain. A white director slinging around the n-word in a homage to '70sblaxploitationà laJackie Brownis one thing, but the same director turning the savageness of slavery into pulp fiction is quite another.""[100]While hosting NBC'sSaturday Night Live, Jamie Foxx joked about being excited ""to kill all the white people in the movie"".[101]Conservative columnistJeff Kuhnerresponded to theSNLskit forThe Washington Times, saying: ""Anti-white bigotry has become embedded in our postmodern culture. TakeDjango Unchained. The movie boils down to one central theme: the white man as devil—a moral scourge who must be eradicated like a lethal virus.""[102]Samuel L. Jackson said toVogue Manthat ""Django Unchainedwas a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than12 Years a Slave, but directorSteve McQueenis an artist and since he's respected for making supposedly art films, it's held in higher esteem thanDjango, because that was basically ablaxploitationmovie.""[103]Violence[edit]The film became infamous for its brutality, with some reviews criticizing it for being much too violent.[104]The originally planned premiere ofDjangowas postponed following theSandy Hook school shootingon December 14, 2012.[105]Thomas Frankcriticized the film's use of violence as follows:Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino has lately become the focus for this sort of criticism (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact thatDjango Unchainedarrived in theaters right around the time of the Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-servingsophistrylike this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as theNRAhas done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino orLaPierre, can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence?[106]The Independentsaid the movie was part of ""the new sadism in cinema"" and added, ""There is something disconcerting about sitting in a crowded cinema as an audience guffaws at the latestgarrotingor falls about in hysterics as someone is beheaded or has a limb lopped off"".[107]Adam SerwerfromMother Jonessaid, ""Django, like many Tarantino films, also has been criticized as cartoonishly violent, but it is only so when Django is killing slave owners and overseers. The violence against slaves is always appropriately terrifying. This, if nothing else, putsDjangoin the running for Tarantino's best film, the first one in which he discovers violence as horror rather than just spectacle. When Schultz turns his head away from a slave being torn apart by dogs, Django explains to Calvin Candie—the plantation owner played by Leo DiCaprio—that Schultz just isn't used to Americans.""[108]""Mandingo"" fights[edit]Although Tarantino has said about Mandingo fighting, ""I was always aware those things existed"", there is no definitive historical evidence that slave owners ever stagedgladiator-like fights to the death between male slaves like the fight depicted in the movie.[109][110]HistorianEdna Greene Medfordnotes that there are only undocumented rumors that such fights took place.[111]David Blight, the director ofYale's center for the study of slavery, said it was not a matter of moral or ethical reservations that prevented slave owners from pitting slaves against each other in combat, but rather economic self-interest: slave owners would not have wanted to put their substantial financial investments at risk in gladiatorial battles.[109][110]The non-historical term ""Mandingo"" for a fine fighting or breeding slave comes not from Tarantino, but the 1975 filmMandingo,[112]which was itself based on a1957 novelwith the same title.Historical inaccuracies[edit]Writing inThe New Yorker,William Jelani Cobbobserved that Tarantino's occasional historical elasticity sometimes worked to the film's advantage. ""There are moments,"" Cobb wrote, ""where this convex history works brilliantly, like when Tarantino depicts theKu Klux Klana decade prior to its actual formation in order to thoroughly ridicule its members' veiled racism.""[113]Tarantino holds that the masked marauders depicted in the film were not the KKK, but a group known as ""The Regulators"". They were depicted as spiritual forebears of the later post-civil war KKK and not as the actual KKK.[114][115]On the matter of historical accuracy,Christopher Caldwellwrote in theFinancial Times: ""Of course, we must not mistake a feature film for a public television documentary"", pointing out that the film should be treated as entertainment, not as a historical account of the period it is set in. ""Djangouses slavery the way a pornographic film might use a nurses' convention: as a pretext for what is really meant to entertain us. What is really meant to entertain us inDjangois violence.""[116]Richard Brody, however, wrote inThe New Yorkerthat Tarantino's ""vision of slavery's monstrosity is historically accurate.... Tarantino rightly depicts slavery as no mere administrative ownership but a grievous and monstrous infliction of cruelty.""[117]Comic book adaptations[edit]A comic book adaptation ofDjango Unchainedwas released byDC Comicsin 2013.[118][119]In 2015, a sequelcrossovercomic entitledDjango/Zorrowas released byDynamite Entertainment, co-written by Tarantino andMatt Wagner, the latter being the first comic book sequel to aQuentin Tarantinofilm.[120]Future[edit]Proposed miniseries[edit]Tarantino has said in an interview that he has 90 minutes of unused material and considered re-editingDjango Unchainedinto a four-hour, four-night cableminiseries. Tarantino said that breaking the story into four parts would be more satisfying to audiences than a four-hour movie: ""... it wouldn't be an endurance test. It would be a miniseries. And people love those.""[121]Potential crossover sequel[edit]Tarantino's first attempt at aDjango Unchainedsequel was with the unpublished paperback novel titledDjango in White Hell. However, after Tarantino decided that the tone of the developing story did not fit with the character's morals, he began re-writing it as an original screenplay which later became the director's follow-up film,The Hateful Eight.[122]In June 2019, Tarantino had pickedJerrod Carmichaelto co-write a film adaptation based on theDjango/Zorrocrossover comic book series.[123]Tarantino andJamie Foxxhave both expressed interest in havingAntonio Banderasreprise his role asZorrofromThe Mask of Zorro(1998) andThe Legend of Zorro(2005) in the film in addition to Foxx himself reprising his role as Django.[124]See also[edit]Boss NiggerList of films featuring slaveryDamsel in distressQuentin Tarantino filmographyRevisionist WesternReferences[edit]^abcdeDebruge, Peter (December 11, 2012).""Django Unchained"".Variety.

It wasLynda Obst's final film as producer before her death. CinematographerHoyte van Hoytemashot it on35 mm filmin thePanavisionanamorphic formatandIMAX70 mm. Filming began in late 2013 and took place inAlberta,Klaustur, andLos Angeles.Interstellaruses extensive practical andminiature effects, and the companyDNEGcreated additionaldigital effects.Interstellarpremiered at theTCL Chinese Theatreon October 26, 2014, and was released in theaters in the United States on November 5, and in the United Kingdom on November 7. In the United States, it was first released onfilm stock, expanding to venues usingdigital projectors. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $681 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, and $758.6 million worldwide with subsequent releases, making it thetenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. Among itsvarious accolades,Interstellarwas nominated for five awards at the87th Academy Awards, winningBest Visual Effects. Since its release, it has been regarded as one of the best films of the 21st century.[4]Plot[edit]In the mid-21st century, humanity facesextinctiondue todust stormsand widespread cropblights. Joseph Cooper, a widowed formerNASAtest pilot, works as a farmer and raises his children, Murph and Tom, alongside his father-in-law Donald. Living in apost-truth society, Cooper is reprimanded by Murph's teachers for telling her that theApollo missionswere not fabricated. During a dust storm, the two discover that dust patterns in Murph's room, which she first attributes to aghost, result from a gravitational anomaly, and translate intogeographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Professor John Brand, who explains that, 48 years earlier, awormholeappeared nearSaturn, leading to a system in anothergalaxywith twelve potentially habitableplanetslocated near ablack holenamed Gargantua. Volunteers of theLazarusexpedition had previously travelled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results.Cooper is enlisted to pilot theEndurancespacecraftthrough the wormhole as part of a mission to colonize ahabitable planetwith 5000frozen embryosand ensure humanity's survival. Meanwhile, Professor Brand would continue his work on solving a gravity equation whose solution would supposedly enable construction of a spacecraft for an exodus from Earth. Cooper accepts against Murph's wishes and promises to return. When she refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare theirrelative timewhen he returns.The crew, consisting of Cooper, robots TARS and CASE, and scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle, traverse the wormhole after a two-year voyage to Saturn. Cooper, Doyle and Brand use alanderto investigate Miller's planet, where time is severelydilated. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantictidal wavekills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines.By the time they leave the planet, Cooper and Brand discover that 23 years have elapsed on theEndurance. Having enough fuel left for only one of the other two planets, Cooper and Romilly decide to go to Mann's planet, despite Brand's protests, as he is still broadcasting. En route, they receive messages from Earth and Cooper watches Tom grow up, get married, and lose his first son. An adult Murph is now a scientist working on the gravity equation with Professor Brand. On his deathbed, Professor Brand confesses that theEndurancecrew was never supposed to return, knowing that a complete solution to the equation was not feasible without observations ofgravitational singularitiesfrom inside a black hole.On Mann's planet, they awaken him fromcryostasis, and he assures them that colonization is possible, despite the extreme environment. During a scouting mission, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified his data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for theEndurance. While abooby trapset by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race back to theEndurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging theEndurance, but Cooper is able to regain control of the station through his own docking maneuver.With insufficient fuel, Cooper and Brand resort to aslingshotaround Gargantua, which costs them 51 years due to time dilation. In the process, Cooper and TARS jettison their landers to lighten theEnduranceso that Brand and CASE may reach Edmunds' planet. Falling into Gargantua'sevent horizon, they eject from their craft and find themselves in atesseractmade up of infinite copies of Murph's bedroom across moments in time. Cooper deduces that the tesseract was constructed by advanced humans in the far future, and realizes that he had always been Murph's ""ghost"". He usesMorse codeto manipulate the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, giving Murph the data that TARS collected, which enables her to complete Professor Brand's solution.The tesseract, its purpose fulfilled, collapses before ejecting Cooper and TARS. Cooper wakes up on astationorbiting Saturn. He reunites with Murph, now elderly and on her deathbed, who tells him to seek out Brand. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Brand and CASE, who are setting up the human colony on Edmunds' habitable planet.Cast[edit]Matthew McConaugheyandAnne Hathawayplayed the protagonists ofInterstellar.Matthew McConaugheyas Joseph ""Coop"" Cooper,[a]a widowedNASApilot who reluctantly becomes a farmer after the agency was closed by the government, and eventually joins theEndurancemission as the lead pilotAnne Hathawayas Dr. Amelia Brand, Professor Brand's daughter and NASA scientist who, aboard theEndurancemission,  is responsible for conducting planet colonization[5]Jessica Chastainas Murphy ""Murph"" Cooper, Joseph's daughter, who eventually becomes a NASA scientist working under Professor BrandEllen Burstynas elderly MurphMackenzie Foyas 10-year-old MurphJohn Lithgowas Donald, Cooper's elderly father-in-lawMichael Caineas Professor John Brand, a high-ranking NASA scientist, father of Amelia, former mentor of Cooper, and director of theLazarusandEndurancemissionsCasey Affleckas Tom Cooper, Joseph's son, who eventually takes charge of his father's farmTimothée Chalametas 15-year-old TomWes Bentleyas Doyle, a high-ranking NASA member, andEndurancecrew memberBill Irwinas TARS (voice and puppetry) and CASE (puppetry), robots assigned to assist the crew of theEnduranceTopher Graceas Getty, Murph's colleague and love interestDavid Gyasias Professor Romilly, a high-ranking NASA member, andEndurancecrew memberMatt Damonas Dr. Mann, a NASA astronaut sent to an icy planet during theLazarusprogramAlso appearing areJosh Stewartas the voice of CASE;Leah Cairnsas Lois, Tom's wife; Liam Dickinson as Coop, Tom's son;David OyelowoandCollette Wolferespectively as school principal and teacher Ms. Hanley;Francis X.

Obst was attached to produce.[9][10]By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write ascreenplay.[11]After Spielberg moved his production studio,DreamWorks, from Paramount toWalt Disney Studiosin 2009, Paramount needed a new director forInterstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.[12]Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use ofspacetimein the story.[13]In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to directInterstellar.[14]Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal ofhuman spaceflight,[15]and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.[16]By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to directInterstellar, which would be produced under his labelSyncopyandLynda Obst Productions.[17]The Hollywood Reportersaid Nolan would earn a salary of$20 millionagainst 20% of the total gross.[18]To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and theprivate space programatSpaceX.[13]Warner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan's production ofInterstellarfrom Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in theFriday the 13thhorror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the television seriesSouth Park. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate ""A-list"" property.[19]In August 2013,Legendary Picturesfinalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film's production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financingBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016) in exchange for the stake inInterstellar.[20]Writing and casting[edit]TheDust Bowlphenomenon of the 1930s, as documented byKen BurnsinThe Dust Bowl(2012), served as inspiration for the blight.Jonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years.[6]To learn the scientific aspects, he studiedrelativityat theCalifornia Institute of Technology.[21]He was pessimistic about theSpace Shuttle programending and how NASA lacked financing for ahuman mission to Mars, drawing inspiration from science-fiction films withapocalypticthemes, such asWALL-E(2008) andAvatar(2009). Jeff Jensen ofEntertainment Weeklysaid: ""He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight, but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair.""[12]His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take theInterstellarscript and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne. He picked what he felt, as director, he could get ""across to the audience and hopefully not lose them"", before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own.[13][22]Among the elements from the original script that Christopher removed was how gravitational waves were used for detecting the wormhole—and then regretted it after LIGO detected gravitational waves just little over a year later.[23]He kept in place Jonathan's conception of the first hour, which is set on aresource-depletedEarth in the near future. The setting was inspired by theDust Bowlthat took place in the United States during theGreat Depressionin the 1930s.[6]He revised the rest of the script, where a team travels into space, instead.[6]After watching the 2012 documentaryThe Dust Bowlfor inspiration, Christopher contacted the director,Ken Burns, and the producer, Dayton Duncan. They granted him permission to use some of their featured interviews inInterstellar.[24]Christopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as aneverymanwith whom ""the audience could experience the story"".[25]He became interested in castingMatthew McConaugheyafter watching him in an early cut of the 2012 filmMud,[25]which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers, Aaron Ryder.[6]Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV seriesTrue Detective.[26]Anne Hathawaywas invited to Nolan's home, where she read the script forInterstellar.[27]In early 2013, both actors were cast in the starring roles.[28]Jessica Chastainwas contacted while she was working onMiss Julie(2014) in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her.[27]Originally,Irrfan Khanwas offered the role of Dr. Mann but rejected it due to scheduling conflicts.Matt Damonwas cast as Mann in late August 2013 and completed filming his scenes in Iceland.[29]Principal photography[edit]Nolan shotInterstellaron 35 mm film in thePanavisionanamorphic formatandIMAX70 mm photography.[30]CinematographerHoyte van Hoytemawas hired forInterstellar, asWally Pfister, Nolan's cinematographer on all of his previous films, was making his directorial debut working onTranscendence(2014);[31]Pfister would later retire as a cinematographer for films.[32]More IMAX cameras were used forInterstellarthan for any of Nolan's previous films. To minimize the use ofcomputer-generated imagery(CGI), Nolan had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.[25]Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to behand-heldfor shooting interior scenes.[6]Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of aLearjet.[33]Nolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy forInterstellar. Writing forThe Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz stated, ""The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ...Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbusterDark Knighttrilogy.""[34]As one security measure,Interstellarwas filmed under the nameFlora's Letter,[35]Flora being one of Nolan's four children with producer Emma Thomas.[13]The Svínafellsjökull glacier inIcelandwas used as a filming location forInterstellar, doubling for Mann's planet.The film'sprincipal photographywas scheduled to last four months.[29]It began onAugust 6, 2013, in the province ofAlberta, Canada.[20]Towns in Alberta where shooting took place includedNanton,Longview,Lethbridge,Fort Macleod, andOkotoks. In Okotoks, filming took place at theSeaman Stadiumand the Olde Town Plaza.[35]For a cornfield scene, production designerNathan Crowleyplanted 500 acres (200 ha) of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalypticdust stormscene,[12]intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s America.[13]Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey's character were also shot inFort Macleod, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blowcellulose-basedsynthetic dust through the air.[36]Filming in the province lasted untilSeptember 9, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras in addition to130 crewmembers, most of whom were local.[35]Shooting also took place in Iceland, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes forBatman Begins(2005).[37]It was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other in water.[6]The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg).[13]They spent two weeks shooting there,[29]during which a crew of about350 people, including130 locals, worked on the film. Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town ofKlaustur.[38][39]While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered fromhypothermiabecause herdry suithad not been properly secured.[13]After the schedule in Iceland was completed, the crew shot in Los Angeles for54 days. Filming locations included theWestin Bonaventure Hoteland Suites, theLos Angeles Convention Center, a Sony PicturessoundstageinCulver City, and a private residence inAltadena, California.[40]Principal photography concluded in December 2013.[41]Production had a budget of$165 million,$10 millionless than was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.[13]Production design[edit]TheEndurancespacecraft (left) is based on theInternational Space Station(right).Interstellarfeatures three spacecraft— theEndurance, a ranger, and a lander. TheEndurance, the crew'smother ship, is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said theEndurancewas based on theInternational Space Station: ""It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose."" The ranger's function is similar to theSpace Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to ""a heavy Russian helicopter.""[6]The film features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robotsanthropomorphicand chose a 1.5 m (4.9 ft)quadrilateraldesign. He said: ""It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So, you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional.""Bill Irwinvoiced and physically controlled both robots, with his image digitally removed, andJosh Stewartreplaced his voicing for CASE.[6]The human space habitats resembleO'Neill cylinders, a theoreticalspace habitatmodel proposed by physicistGerard K. O'Neillin 1976.[42]Sound design[edit]Gregg LandakerandGary Rizzowere the film'saudio engineerstasked withaudio mixing, while sound editorRichard Kingsupervised the process.[43]Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment[44]and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.[12]The studio's website stated that the film was ""mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in thesubwooferchannel.""[45]Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.[46]Music[edit]Main article:Interstellar(soundtrack)Hans Zimmer, who scored Nolan'sThe Dark Knight TrilogyandInception(2010), returned to scoreInterstellar. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of theInterstellarsoundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided the 1926 four-manualHarrison & Harrisonorgan of theTemple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score.[47][48]Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions forInterstellar, three times more than forInception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.[12]Visual effects[edit]The visual effects companyDouble Negative, which worked onInception, was brought back forInterstellar.[49]According to visual effects supervisorPaul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan'sThe Dark Knight Rises(2012) orInception. However, forInterstellar, they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front ofgreen screens.[6]The film contained 850 visual-effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.[50]The ranger,Endurance, and lander spacecraft were created usingminiature effectsby Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space.3D-printedand hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname ""maxatures"" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of theEndurancemodule spanned over 7.6 m (25 ft), while apyrotechnicmodel of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned 14 m (46 ft) and over 15 m (49 ft), respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axisgimbalon a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space usingVistaVisioncameras on a smaller motion control rig.[51]New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.[50]Influences[edit]Nolan was influenced by what he called ""key touchstones"" of science fiction cinema, includingMetropolis(1927),2001: A Space Odyssey(1968),Blade Runner(1982),[52]Star Wars(1977), andAlien(1979).[53]Andrei Tarkovsky'sThe Mirror(1975) influenced ""elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water"", according to Nolan,[54]who also comparedInterstellartoThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre(1948) as a film about human nature.[55]He sought to emulate films likeSteven Spielberg'sJaws(1975) andClose Encounters of the Third Kind(1977) for being family-friendly but also ""as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum"". He screenedThe Right Stuff(1983) for the crew before production,[6]following in its example by capturing reflections on theInterstellarastronauts' visors. For further inspiration, Nolan invited former astronautMarsha Ivinsto the set.[13]Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmakerToni Myersfor visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.[56]Clark Kent's upbringing inMan of Steel(2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.[22]Apart from the films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture ofLudwig Mies van der Rohe.[13]Scientific accuracy[edit]Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist and Nobel Laureate, served as scientific consultant and executive producer.Regarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne said he ""worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based onEinstein'sgeneral relativityequations"".[57]Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: ""First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations [...] would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter."" Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.[10]At one point, Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.[58]According to Thorne, the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.[10]The astrobiologistDavid Grinspooncriticized the dire ""blight"" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.[59]Neil deGrasse Tyson, anastrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending ofInterstellar, concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that ""we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it"".[60]The theoretical physicistMichio Kakupraised the film for its scientific accuracy and saidInterstellar""could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come"". Timothy Reyes, a former NASAsoftware engineer, said: ""Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent"".[61]Wormholes and black holes[edit]Miller's planet orbiting GargantuaTo create the visual effects for the wormhole and arotating,supermassive black hole(possessing anergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people atDouble Negative, providing pages of deeply sourcedtheoretical equationsto the engineers, who then wrote newCGIrendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of thegravitational lensingcaused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800terabytesof data.[7]Thorne described theaccretion diskof the black hole as ""anemic and at low temperature[62]—about the temperature of the surface of the sun,"" allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enoughgamma radiationandX-raysto threaten nearby astronauts and planets.[63]The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of threescientific papers.[64][65][66]The first image of the event horizon of a black hole, obtained by theEvent Horizon Telescopein 2019. The asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is well visible here.Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for theDoppler effectwhich, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.[67]Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.[68]As a reference, the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image[69]of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by theEvent Horizon Telescopeteam in 2019.Futura-Sciencespraised the correct depiction of thePenrose process.[70]According toSpace.com, the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.[71]Marketing[edit]The teaser trailer forInterstellardebutedDecember 13, 2013, and featured clips related tospace exploration, accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character, Cooper.[72]The theatrical trailer debutedMay 5, 2014, at theLockheed MartinIMAX Theater inWashington, D.C., and was made available online later that month. For the week ending onMay 19, it was the most-viewed film trailer, with over19.5 millionviews onYouTube.[73]Christopher Nolan and McConaughey made their first appearances atSan Diego Comic-Conin July 2014 to promoteInterstellar. That same month, Paramount Pictures launched an interactive website, on which users uncovered astar chartrelated to theApollo 11Moon landing.[74]In October 2014, Paramount partnered withGoogleto promoteInterstellaracross multiple platforms.[75]The film's website was relaunched as a digital hub hosted on a Google domain,[76]which collected feedback from film audiences, and linked to a mobile app.[76]It featured a game in which players could buildSolar Systemmodels and use aflight simulatorfor space travel.[77]The Paramount–Google partnership also included a virtualtime capsulecompiled with user-generated content, made available in 2015.[78]The initiative Google for Education used the film as a basis for promoting math and science lesson plans in schools.[75][79]Paramount provided avirtual realitywalkthrough of theEndurancespacecraft usingOculus Rifttechnology. It hosted the walkthrough sequentially in New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., fromOctober 6throughNovember 19, 2014.[80][81]The publisherRunning PressreleasedInterstellar: Beyond Time and Space, a book byMark Cotta Vazabout the making of the film, onNovember 11.[82]W. W. Norton & CompanyreleasedThe Science of Interstellar, a book by Thorne;[83]Titan Booksreleased the official novelization, written byGreg Keyes;[84]andWiredmagazine released a tie-inonline comic,Absolute Zero, written by Christopher Nolan and drawn bySean Gordon Murphy. The comic is aprequelto the film, with Mann as the protagonist.[85]Release[edit]Theatrical[edit]BeforeInterstellar's public release, Paramount CEOBrad Greyhosted a private screening onOctober 19, 2014, at the AMC Lincoln Square IMAX theater inManhattan, New York.[86][87]Paramount then showedInterstellarto some of the industry's filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at theCalifornia Science CenteronOctober 22.[88]On the following day, the film was screened at theTCL Chinese TheatreinLos Angeles, California for over900 membersof theScreen Actors Guild.[89]The film premiered onOctober 26at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles,[90]and in Europe onOctober 29at theOdeon Leicester Squarein London.[91][92]Interstellarwas released early on November 4 in various70 mmIMAX film, 70 mm film and35 mmfilm theaters, and had a limited release inNorth AmericaonNovember 5, with a wide release onNovember 7.[93]The film was released in Belgium, France, and Switzerland onNovember 5, the UK onNovember 7and in additional territories in the following days.[94]For the limited North American release,Interstellarwas projected from 70 mm and 35 mm film in249 theatersthat still supported those formats, including at leastforty-one 70 mm IMAXtheaters. A70 mmIMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format. The film's wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally.[95]Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America, and Warner Bros. distributed it in the remaining territories.[30]The film was released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide, which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas,[96][97]until surpassed byUniversal Pictures'Furious 7(2015) with 810 IMAX theaters.[98]Interstellarwas an exception to Paramount Pictures' goal to stop releasing films onfilm stockand to distribute them only in digital format.[99]According to Pamela McClintock ofThe Hollywood Reporter, the initiative to projectInterstellaron film stock would help preserve an endangered format,[95]which was supported by Christopher Nolan,J. J. Abrams,Quentin Tarantino,Judd Apatow,Paul Thomas Anderson, and other filmmakers.[100]McClintock reported that theatre owners saw this as ""backward"", as nearly all theatres in the US had been converted to digital projection.[101]Interstellarwas re-released in theaters on December 6, 2024, for its 10th anniversary, showing in 70 mm IMAX and digital formats.[102][103]At the weekend box office, the re-release grossed $14 million worldwide, boosting the film's total box office figure to $720 million globally.[104]With the re-release, the film also crossed the $200 million box office threshold in the United States, and has gone on to be the highest-grossing IMAX re-release of all time, accumulating $24.4 million at the worldwide box office, as of December 20, 2024.[105][106]Home media[edit]Interstellarwas released onhome videoon March 31, 2015, in both the United Kingdom and United States.[107]It topped the home video sales chart for a total of two weeks.[108][109]It was reported thatInterstellarwas the most pirated film of 2015, with an estimated 46.7 million downloads onBitTorrent.[110]It was released in theUltra HD Blu-rayformat on December 19, 2017.[111]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]Interstellargrossed $188 million in the US and Canada, and $493 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $681 million on original release, against a production budget of $165 million.[3]Deadline Hollywoodcalculated the net profit to be $47 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs, with box office grosses, and ancillary revenues from home media, placing it 20th on their list of 2014's ""Most Valuable Blockbusters"".[112]It sold an estimated 22 million tickets domestically.[113]The film set an IMAX opening record worldwide with $20.5 million from 574 IMAX theaters, surpassing the $17 million record held byThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire(2013), and is the best opening for an IMAX 2D, non-sequel, and November IMAX release.[114]It had a worldwide opening of $133 million, which was the tenth-largest opening of 2014,[115]and became thetenth-highest-grossing film of 2014.[116]Interstellaris the fourth film to gross over $100 million worldwide from IMAX ticket sales.[117][118][119]It was released in the UK, Ireland and Malta on November 6, 2014, and debuted at number one earning £5.5 million ($8.6 million) in its opening weekend, which was lower than the openings ofThe Dark Knight Rises(£14.4 million),Gravity(£6.2 million), andInception(£5.9 million).[120]The film was released in 35 markets on the same day, including major markets like Germany, Russia, Australia, and Brazil earning $8.7 million in total.[121]Through Sunday, it earned an opening weekend total of $83 million from 11.1 million admissions from over 14,800 screens in 62 markets.[122]It earned $7.3 million from 206 IMAX screens, at an average of 35,400 viewers per theater.[123]It went to number one in South Korea ($14.4 million),[124]Russia ($8.9 million), and France ($5.3 million). Other strong openings occurred in Germany ($4.6 million), India ($4.3 million), Italy ($3.7 million), Australia ($3.7 million), Spain ($2.7 million), Mexico ($3.1 million), and Brazil ($1.9 million).[125]Interstellarwas released in China on November 12 and earned $5.4 million on its opening day on Wednesday, which is Nolan's biggest opening in China after surpassing the $4.61 million opening record ofThe Dark Knight Rises.[126][127]It went on to earn $41.7 million in its opening weekend, accounting for 55% of the market share.[128][129]It is Nolan's biggest opening in China, Warner Bros.' biggest 2D opening,[130]and the studio's third-biggest opening of all time, behind 2014'sThe Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies($49.5 million)[131]and 2013'sPacific Rim($45 million).[132][133][needs update?]It topped the box office outside North America for two consecutive weekends before being overtaken byThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1(2014) in its third weekend.[130]Just 31 days after its release, the film became the13th-most-successful film and 3rd-most-successful foreign film in South Koreawith 9.1 million admissions trailing onlyAvatar(13.3 million admissions), and 2013'sFrozen(10.3 million admissions).[134]The film closed down its theatrical run in China on December 12, with total revenue of $122.6 million.[135][136]In total earnings, its largest markets outside North America and China were South Korea ($73.4 million), the UK, Ireland and Malta ($31.3 million), and Russia and theCommonwealth of Independent States(CIS) ($19 million).[137]InterstellarandBig Hero 6opened the same weekend (November 7–9, 2014) in the US and Canada. Both were forecast to earn between$55 millionand$60 million.[138]In North America, the film is the seventh-highest-grossing film to not hit No. 1, with a top rank of No. 2 on its opening weekend.[139]Interstellarhad an early limited release in the US and Canada in selected theaters on November 4 at 8:00 pm, coinciding with the2014 US midterm elections.[140]It topped the box office the following day, earning $1.35 million from 249 theaters (42 of which were IMAX screens); IMAX accounted for 62% of its total gross.[141]Two hundred and forty of those theaters played in 35 mm, 70 mm, and IMAX 70 mm film formats.[142]It earned $3.6 million from late-night shows for a previews total of $4.9 million.[143][144][145]The film waswidely releasedon November 7 and topped the box office on its opening day, earning $17 million ahead ofBig Hero 6($15.8 million).[146]On its opening weekend, the film earned $47.5 million[b]from 3,561 theaters, debuting in second place after a neck-and-neck competition withDisney'sBig Hero 6($56.2 million).[148]IMAX comprised $13.2 million (28%) of its opening weekend gross,[148]while other premium large-format screens comprised $5.3 million (10.5%) of the gross.[149][150]In its second weekend, the film fell to No. 3 behindBig Hero 6and newcomerDumb and Dumber To(2014), and dropped 39% earning $29 million for a two-weekend total of $98 million.[151][152]It earned $7.4 million from IMAX theaters from 368 screens in its second weekend.[153][154]In its third week, the film earned $15 million and remained at No. 3, below newcomerThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1andBig Hero 6.[155]Critical response[edit]Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes, 73% of 378 critic reviews are positive, with an average of 7.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, ""Interstellarrepresents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp.""[156]Metacriticassigned the film a score of 74 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating ""generally favorable"" reviews.[157]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave it an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.[158]Scott Foundas, chief film critic atVariety, said thatInterstellaris ""as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done"" and considered the film ""more personal"" than Nolan's previous films.[159]Claudia Puig ofUSA Todaypraised the visual spectacle and powerful themes, while criticizing the ""dull"" dialogue and ""tedious patches inside the space vessel"".[160]David StrattonofAt the Moviesrated the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, commending its ambition, effects, and 70 mm IMAX presentation, though criticizing the sound for ""being so loud"" as to make some of the dialogue ""inaudible"". Conversely, co-hostMargaret Pomeranzrated the film three out of five, as she felt the human drama got lost among the film's scientific concepts.[161]Henry Barnes ofThe Guardianscored the film three out of five stars, calling it ""a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour"".[162]James BerardinellicalledInterstellar""an amazing achievement"" and ""simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking.""[163]He named it the best film of 2014,[164]and the second-best movie of the decade, deeming it a ""realscience fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers"".[165]""It's been a while since somebody has come out with such a big vision to things ... Even the elements, the fact that dust is everywhere, and they're living in this dust bowl that is just completely enveloping this area of the world.

Love.""[170]Describing Nolan as a ""merchant of awe"", Tim Robey ofThe Telegraphthought thatInterstellarwas ""agonisingly"" close to a masterpiece, highlighting the conceptual boldness and ""deep-digging intelligence"" of the film.[171]Todd McCarthyofThe Hollywood Reporterwrote, ""This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that.""[172]In his review for theAssociated Press, Jake Coyle praised the film for its ""big-screen grandeur"", while finding some of the dialogue ""clunky"". He described it further as ""an absurd endeavor"" and ""one of the most sublime movies of the decade"".[173]Scott Mendelson ofForbeslistedInterstellaras one of the most disappointing films of 2014, stating that the film ""has a lack of flow, loss of momentum following the climax, clumsy sound mixing"", and ""thin characters"" despite seeing the film twice in order to ""give it a second chance"". He wrote thatInterstellar""ends up as a stripped-down and somewhat muted variation on any number of 'go into space to save the world' movies.""[174]Matt Zoller SeitzofRogerEbert.comgave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding Nolan's excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition, ""[Interstellar] is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away ... At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of aJohn Fordpicture ... a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one.""[175]New York TimescolumnistDavid Brooksconcludes thatInterstellarexplores the relationships among ""science and faith and science and the humanities"" and ""illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms"".[176]Mark Steyn commented on the technological future and the focus on the father-daughter relationship.[177]Wai Chee Dimock, in theLos Angeles Review of Books, wrote that Nolan's films are ""rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees,"" and that ""although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-cli-fi film, holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything.

As the family has financial struggles and low-income jobs, family friend Min-hyuk gives them ascholar's rockmeant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo lie about his qualifications to take over Min-hyuk's job as an English tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the wealthy but naïve Park family. Min-hyuk trusts Ki-woo because he likes Da-hye and wants to ask her out when he returns. After Ki-jung helps forge a certificate for him, Ki-woo, posing as aYonsei Universitystudent named ""Kevin"", goes to the Park's home. The mother explains how fond they are of Min and that Ki-woo needs to be up to his standard. She then asks to sit in on Da-hye's first lesson, and he is hired.The Kims scheme to secure jobs for each family member within the Park household while concealing their true identities. Ki-woo recommends ""Jessica,"" actually Ki-jung, as anart therapistfor the Parks' young son, Da-song, who has been traumatised after seeing a ""ghost"" in their kitchen. Ki-jung then frames Yoon, the Parks' chauffeur, by making it appear as though he had a sexual encounter in the car, leading to Ki-taek being hired as his replacement. The Kims exploit thepeachallergy of the Parks' longtime housekeeper, Moon-gwang, to convince Mrs Park that Moon-gwang hastuberculosis, and Chung-sook is hired as her replacement. Meanwhile, Ki-woo begins a secret romantic relationship with Da-hye.While the Parks are away on a camping trip, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the house. Moon-gwang appears at the door, claiming to have forgotten something in the basement. She goes through a hidden entrance to an underground bunker created by the house's architect and previous owner, who had kept its existence secret from the Parks. There, Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been hiding from loan sharks and is revealed to be the ""ghost"" Da-song saw when he was trying to leave the bunker to steal food. Moon-gwang begs Chung-sook to allow Geun-sae to continue living there in exchange for regular payments, but the three other Kims, who are eavesdropping, accidentally reveal their true identities. Moon-gwang films them and threatens to expose their deception to the Parks.After the Parks call to inform the Kims that they are returning early due to a sudden severe rainstorm, the Kims quickly destroy all evidence of their ruse and subdue Moon-gwang and Geun-sae in the bunker, although Moon-gwang is injured during the struggle. The Kims manage to escape, but the torrential rain floods their flat with sewage water, forcing them to take shelter in a gymnasium alongside other displaced people.The next day, Mrs Park organises an impromptu garden party for Da-song's birthday, with the elder Kims assisting while the younger Kims are invited as guests. Ki-woo enters the bunker with his scholar's rock, intending to kill Geun-sae and Moon-gwang. Moon-gwang is already dead from injuries sustained in the previous day's brawl; Geun-sae bludgeons Ki-woo with the rock, leaving him unconscious. Geun-sae then leaves the bunker and stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of horrified party guests. Da-song suffers a seizure upon seeing the ""ghost"" again. Chung-sook impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer after a struggle. While Ki-taek tends to Ki-jung, Mr Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. Ki-taek, momentarily enraged by Mr Park's lack of empathy, stabs him with Geun-sae's knife and flees.Weeks later, Ki-woo is recovering from brain surgery, and he and Chung-sook have been convicted of fraud and placed on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injuries, and Ki-taek – now a wanted fugitive – has disappeared. Geun-sae is presumed to have been a random homeless man, and the motives for the murders remain unsolved. Ki-woo spies on the Parks' former home, now owned by a foreign family, and notices aMorse codemessage in a light visible from outside. Ki-taek, hiding in the bunker, has buried Moon-gwang in the garden and sends daily messages, hoping Ki-woo will see them.

While working onSnowpiercer, Bong was encouraged by a theatre actor friend to write a play. He had been a tutor for the son of a wealthy family in Seoul in his early 20s and considered turning his experience into a stage production.[17]The film's title,Parasite, was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, and he had to convince the film's marketing group to use it. He said: ""Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious thatParasiterefers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites.""[18]Writing[edit]After completingSnowpiercer, Bong wrote a 15-pagefilm treatmentfor the first half ofParasite, which his production assistant onSnowpiercer, Han Jin-won, turned into three different drafts of the screenplay.[17]After finishingOkja, Bong returned to the project and finished the script. Han is credited as a co-writer.[17]Bong said the film was influenced by the 1960 Korean ""domestic Gothic"" filmThe Housemaid, in which a middle-class family's stability is threatened by a disruptive interloper in the form of household help.[19]Bong further referenced the design of the wealthy protagonist's house inKurosawa's 1963 filmHigh and Lowas an important visual influence, as was the incident ofChristine and Léa Papinto the story—an event wherein two live-in maids murdered their employers in 1930s France.[20][21]Bong had also tutored for a rich family himself. He said: ""I got this feeling that I was infiltrating the private lives of complete strangers. Every week I would go into their house, and I thought how fun it would be if I could get all my friends to infiltrate the house one by one.""[22]Additionally, Moon-gwang's allergy to peaches was inspired by one of Bong's university friends having this allergy.[23]Darcy Paquet, an American residing in South Korea, translated the English subtitles, writing directly with Bong.[24]Paquet renderedJjapagurior Chapaguri, a dish cooked by a character in the film, asram-don, meaningramen-udon. It is a mix ofChapagettiandNeoguriproduced byNongshim.[25]The English version of the film shows packages labeled in English ""ramyeon"" and ""udon"" to highlight to English speakers how the name was created. Paquet believed the wordram-dondid not previously exist as he found no results on Google.[26]On one occasion, Paquet usedOxford Universityas a reference instead ofSeoul National University, and in another, usedWhatsAppas the messaging application instead ofKakaoTalk.[24]Paquet chose Oxford overHarvardbecause of Bong's affinity for the United Kingdom, and because Paquet believed using Harvard would be ""too obvious"".[26]Paquet wrote, ""In order for humor to work, people need to understand it immediately. With an unfamiliar word, the humor is lost.""[26]Filming[edit]Parasite filming location at Jahamun Tunnel in Seoul.Principal photography forParasitebegan on 18 May 2018[27][28]and ended on 19 September.[29]Filming took place aroundSeouland inJeonju.[30]Thedirector of photographywasHong Kyung-pyo, a well-known South Koreancinematographerwho had worked with other well-known directors.[31]He shot the film with theArri Alexa 65and usedAngénieux zoom lens.[32]The Parks' house[edit]The house was constructed on a set and everything above the first floor was added in post-production.The Parks' house was a specially constructed set. The ground floor and the garden were constructed on an empty outdoor lot, while the basement and first floor were constructed on set.[33]""We built the main floor of the house in a backlot and for the second floor it was all green screen outside"", explained editorYang Jin-mo. ""When we shot toward the outside from inside, everything beyond the garden was allVFX.""[34]As part of the scripting, Bong also designed the home's basic layout. ""It's like its own universe inside this film. Each character and each team has spaces that they take over, that they can infiltrate, and also secret spaces that they don't know.""[35]A fictional architect, Namgoong Hyeonja, was created as the home's designer and previous owner, and production designer Lee Ha-jun considered the house's form and function based on how Namgoong would design it.[33]It was designed and constructed to be not only beautiful but ""a stage that served the precise needs of his camera, compositions, and characters, while embodying his film's rich themes"".[36]Lee said, ""Since Mr Park's house is built by an architect in the story, it wasn't easy finding the right approach to designing the house...I'm not an architect, and I think there's a difference in how an architect envisions a space and how a production designer does. We prioritize blocking and camera angles while architects build spaces for people to actually live in and thus design around people. So I think the approach is very different.""[35]For example, Ha-jun established that Namgoong would have used the first floor's living room to appreciate the garden, so it was built with a single wide window and only spartan seating options for this function.[33]Some of the interior artwork in the house sets were by South Korean artist Seung-mo Park, including existing artwork of hers and some created for the film.[33]The team designed the home and interiors to make the set amenable for filming at the 2.35:1 aspect ratio, favouring wide and deep rooms rather than height.[35]Lee said the sun was an important factor when building the outdoor set. ""The sun's direction was a crucial point of consideration while we were searching for outdoor lots"", he said. ""We had to remember the sun's position during our desired time frame and determine the positions and sizes of the windows accordingly. In terms of practical lighting, the DP [Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color. He wanted sophisticated indirect lighting and the warmth fromtungsten light sources. Before building the set, the DP and I visited the lot several times to check the sun's movement each time, and we decided on the set's location together"".[35]The Kims' flat[edit]The Kims' semi-basement flat and its street were also built on set, partially out of necessity for the flooding scenes.[35]Lee Ha-jun visited and photographed several abandoned villages and towns in South Korea scheduled to be torn down to help inform the set design. He also created stories for the Kims' neighbours and added details of those residents along the street to improve the authenticity of the street's appearance.[33]Editing[edit]According to editor Yang Jin-mo, Bong chose to shoot the film without traditionalcoverage. To give them more editing options with limited shots, they sometimes stitched together different takes of the same shot.[37]Yang edited the film usingFinal Cut Pro 7, a program not updated since 2011.[38]The film was produced for release in colour. Ablack and whiteversion was produced before the world premiere in Cannes, debuted on 26 January 2020 at theInternational Film Festival Rotterdam, and was re-screened from 29 to 31 January. It also received a limited release in some countries.[39][40]Music[edit]Main article:Parasite(soundtrack)Thescore, by South Korean composerJung Jae-il, consisted of ""minimalist piano pieces, punctuated with light percussion"", setting the film's ""tense atmosphere"".[41]It also had a baroque texture with excerpts fromHandel's operaRodelindaand the 1964 Italian song ""In ginocchio da te"" byGianni Morandi.[41][42]It was recorded mostly through computer sounds.[43]The soundtrack was published and released in Korea, in digital and physical formats, byGenie MusicandStone Music Entertainmenton 30 May 2019.[44]Internationally, it was released on 11 October 2019 byMilan Records.[45]It was released in English titles,[46]but the names and nouns are different from the English subtitles as translated by Paquet.[47]On 14 February 2020, it was released in double-vinyl bySacred Bones Records(a division of American film production company Neon) andWaxwork Records, in multicolour variants.[48]An original song, ""Soju han jan"" (소주 한 잔;lit.A glass ofsoju), written by Bong and performed byChoi Woo-shik, who plays Ki-woo, is heard during the film's end credits.[49]For marketing the soundtrack's international digital releases, the song was displayed in English as ""Soju One Glass"" [sic]; it was later changed to a grammatically correct title to be shortlisted for theBest Original Songcategory at the92nd Academy Awards.[49][50]Themes and interpretations[edit]See also:Economic inequality in South KoreaThe main themes ofParasiteareclass conflict,social inequalityandwealth disparity.[51][52][53]Film critics and Bong Joon Ho himself have considered the film as a reflection oflate-stage capitalism,[54][55]and some have associated it with the term ""Hell Joseon"" (헬조선), a satirical phrase that posits that living in hell would be akin to living in modern South Korea. This term came about due to high rates of youth unemployment, the intense demands of pursuinghigher education, the crisis of home affordability, and the increasing socioeconomic gap between the wealthy and poor.[56][57][58]InCoronavirus Capitalism Goes to the Cinema, Nulman writes that the word ""parasite"" originally referred to a ""person who eats at the table of another"", which occurs in one scene of the film.[53]Nulman also notes the connection between parasites and theKarl Marxquote:Thecapitalist... is only capital personified. His soul is the soul of capital. But capital has one sole driving force, the drive to valorize itself, to createsurplus-value, to make its constant part, the means of production, absorb the greatest possible amount ofsurplus labor. Capital is dead labor which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor, and lives the more, the more labor it sucks.[53]The film also analyses the use of connections and qualifications to get ahead, for rich and poor families alike.[59]Some argue that its discussion of class relates toPierre Bourdieu's concept ofhabitus.[53]Bong has referred toParasiteas an upstairs/downstairs or ""stairway movie"",[21]in which staircases are used as a motif to represent the positions of the families in the homes of the Kims and the Parks, as well as the basement bunker.[60]The Kims' semi-basement apartment is typical for poorer Seoul residents due to its lower rent, despite having issues such as mold and increased risk of disease.[51]Monsoonfloods such as the one depicted in the film commonly damage these types of residences the most.[59]The film presents class in spatial terms that speak to hierarchy, according to Nulman.[53][61]According to Bong, the ending implies that Ki-woo will not be able to earn the funds needed to buy the house, as the final shot shows him still in the basement flat and recalls the first scene; he described this shot as a ""surefire kill"" (확인사살), referring to acoup de graceto ensure death.[21]The ending song refers to Ki-woo working to make money to get the house. Choi Woo-shik estimated that it would take approximately 564 years for Ki-woo to earn enough money to purchase the house. Nevertheless, he was optimistic: ""I'm pretty sure Ki-woo is one of those bright kids. He'll come up with some idea, and he would just go into the German family's house, and I think he will rescue his father"".[14]But on many interpretations, this dream subscribes to abootstrappingmentality and is unlikely to be achieved;[21][54][14]furthermore, ""it does not address the fundamental problem at hand. Even in this fantasy scenario, Ki-taek would still be contained in the house by a legal system that would seek his prosecution and imprisonment. The forces that created and upheld the Kim family's separation would not be undone, merely adapted to"".[62]Park Da-song is obsessed with ""Indians"" and owns Native American-themed toys and inauthentic replicas.[63][64][53]Nulman makes the link between the ""native"" Park family and the invaders: the Kims, who bring with them deadly parasites to which the natives have no immunity. Nulman points to themiasma theoryof scent carrying disease: it was thought that natives could catch diseases just by smelling the noxious air carried by colonising Spaniards. This connects to the film's theme around the class distinction of smell.[53]Bong has noted: ""I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a commentary on what happened in the United States, but it's related in the sense that this family starts infiltrating the house and they already find a family living there. So you could say it's a joke in that context. But at the same time, the Native Americans have a very complicated and long, deep history. But in this family, that story is reduced to a young boy's hobby and decoration. The boy's mother mentions the tent as a US imported good, and I think it's like theChe GuevaraT-shirts that people wear. They don't know the life of the revolutionary figure, they just think it's a cool T-shirt. That's what happens in our current time: the context and meaning behind these actual things only exists as a surface-level thing"".[65]Some critics note the importance of working-class solidarity as presented in the film. The Kims' problems are a result of lack of class solidarity with the other poor family, Geun-sae and Moon-gwang. At the film's climax, Ki-taek becomes aware of his class identity when Mr Park is disgusted by Geun-sae's smell.[53]Others saidParasiterevealed the misfortunes of poor, powerless victims of an indifferent world who are transformed into liberation through the comical effect of mass slaughter.[66]Release[edit]Theatrical[edit]Director and stars at an April 2019 press event.Neonacquired the US and Canadian rights to the film at the 2018American Film Market.[67][68]Darcy Paquet, an American film critic and author, provided English translations for the film's international release.

In the film, it was labelled 'Woori Supermarket'.TheSeoul Tourism Organization(STO) has been criticised by South Korea's opposition party and residents of Seoul for introducing a tour route featuring filming locations and stories from the film.The Justice Partyclaims that it became famous due to the universal recognition of global inequality,[167]but sees the development of a tourist attraction based on the film in Seoul as further exploitation of poverty.[168]Residents ofParasite's filming locations have reportedly complained of a sense of embarrassment and discomfort due to an increase in tourists visiting their neighbourhoods and taking photos of their surroundings, making them feel like ""monkeys in a zoo"".[169]In response, the local government of Seoul has announced that government funding will prioritise the estimated 1,500 low-income families living in the semi-basement type accommodations featured in the film.[170]People began posting videos on how to make jjapaguri (called ""ram-don"" in the film's English subtitles) onYouTubeafter the film was distributed.[25]Nongshim, the manufacturer of Chapagetti and Neoguri, also began distributing a singular ""Chapaguri"" product due to the combination's popularity from the film.[171]Bibliography[edit]Botz-Bornstein, Thorsten; Stamatellos, Giannis (2022).Parasite: A Philosophical Exploration.

The French-produced film was largely silent with Frenchintertitlesand contained a few spoken lines in English.[9]The Academy dictates foreign language as the main qualification for international film, henceThe Artistdid not qualify.[10]Further, while prior winnersThe Last EmperorandSlumdog Millionaireinclude significant amounts of non-English dialogue, they were considered products of the Hollywood system.[9]^The previous two films to win both awards wereThe Lost Weekend(1945) andMarty(1955).References[edit]^abcd""Parasiteinternational press kit""(PDF).CJ Entertainment. 2019.

The film loosely adapts plot elements fromBatman: The Killing Joke(1988) andThe Dark Knight Returns(1986), but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration, nor did they wish for it to be connected to any priorBatmanfilm continuity. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August.Principal photographytook place inNew York City,Jersey CityandNewark, from September to December 2018.Jokeris the first live-actiontheatricalBatmanfilmto receive anR ratingfrom theMotion Picture Association.[a]Jokerpremiered at the76th Venice International Film Festivalon August 31, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 4.

He suffers from aneurological disorderthat causes him to have random, uncontrollable laughing fits, requiring medication he depends on social services to obtain. After Arthur is attacked by street youths while on the job, his co-worker Randall gives him arevolverto defend himself. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to see his routine at a comedy club.Arthur accidentally drops his gun while performing at a children's hospital, leading to his firing. While riding home on the subway and still wearing his clown make-up, he is mocked and assaulted by three drunk businessmen fromWayne Investments. He fatally shoots two of them inself-defenseandmurdersthe third as he attempts to flee. Their employer, billionaire mayoral candidateThomas Wayne, condemns the killings, but supporters begin sporting clown masks in Arthur's image. Budget cuts shut down the social services program, leaving Arthur without his medication.Sophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which fails due to his disorder and his jokes falling flat. Arthur intercepts a letter from Penny to Thomas indicating that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth of his parentage. He goes toWayne Manor, where he meets Thomas's young sonBruce, but flees after a scuffle with family butlerAlfred Pennyworth. Penny suffers a stroke after being questioned by two detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the subway murders, and is hospitalized. Arthur's idol, popularlate-night talk showhost Murray Franklin, presents clips of Arthur's failed performance on his show and mockingly calls him a ""joker"", much to Arthur's distress.Arthur confronts Thomas at a movie theatre. Thomas denies being his father, claiming that Penny also is not his biological mother. Arthur visitsArkham State Hospitaland reads Penny's file, which states she was a delusional narcissist who adopted Arthur while working as a housekeeper for the Waynes. She developed an imaginary intimate relationship with Thomas, which included Arthur being their biological son. At the same time, Penny raised Arthur with a boyfriend who physically and sexually abused them, leading to his neurological disorder. A distraught Arthur enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, she kindly asks him to leave, revealing their relationship to be a figment of Arthur's imagination. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.After being invited onto Murray's show, Arthur is visited by Randall and another ex-colleague, Gary. Arthur fatally stabs and beats Randall, but spares Gary for being kind to him in the past. The detectives investigating Arthur pursue him onto a train filled with clown protesters. Arthur incites a brawl, during which one detective accidentally shoots and kills a protester. The other protesters, in turn, beat the detectives while Arthur escapes.At the studio, Arthur asks Murray to introduce him as ""Joker"", a reference to his earlier mockery. As the show broadcasts live, Arthur tells morbid jokes, confesses to the subway murders, rants about societal neglect of the downtrodden, and berates Murray for ridiculing him. After a final joke, Arthur fatally shoots Murray in the head. Arthur is arrested, and riots erupt across the city. Looters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur and free him. Meanwhile, one rioter corners the Wayne family in an alley andmurders Thomas and his wife Marthain front of Bruce. Arthur stands atop the police car, dances to the cheers of the crowd, and smears the blood on his face into a smile.Sometime later at Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke during a session with his new therapist. He declines telling it to her, claiming she would not understand it. He leaves behind a trail of bloodied shoeprints as an orderly chases him down.Cast[edit]Joaquin PhoenixRobert De NiroZazie BeetzJoaquin PhoenixasArthur Fleck / Joker: A mentally ill, impoverished party clown and stand-up comedian disregarded by society,[4]whose history of abuse causes him to become anihilisticcriminal with a clown-inspired persona.[5]Phoenix had been interested in a low-budget ""character study"" of a comic book character and said the film ""feels unique, it is its own world in some ways and maybe [...] It might as well be the thing that scares you the most"".[6]Phoenix lost 52 pounds (23 kg) for his role in the film.[7][8][9]Robert De Niroas Murray Franklin:[10]A talk show host who plays a role in Arthur's downfall.[11]De Niro said his role inJokerpayshomageto his character fromThe King of Comedy(1982), Rupert Pupkin, who is a comedian obsessed with a talk-show host.[10]Zazie Beetzas Sophie Dumond:[12]A cynical single mother and Arthur's ""love interest"".[12][13]Beetz, a huge fan of Phoenix, said that it was an honor to costar with him[14]and that she learned a lot working with him on set.[15]Frances Conroyas Penny Fleck: Arthur's mentally and physically ill mother,[16]who formerly worked forThomas Wayne.[17]Hannah Grossas young Penny.[18]Brett CullenasThomas Wayne, a billionaire running for mayor of Gotham.[19]Alec Baldwinwas initially cast in the role, but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts.[20][21]Carrie Louise Putrello asMartha, Thomas's wife, although the character has no dialogue (she only screams) and is never referred to by name.[22]Douglas HodgeasAlfred Pennyworth, the butler and caretaker of the Wayne family.[23]Dante Pereira-OlsonasBruce Wayne, Thomas' and Martha's son.[24][25]Glenn FleshlerandLeigh Gillas Randall and Gary[26][27]Bill CampandShea Whighamas the detectives Garrity and Burke in theGotham City Police Department.[28]Marc Maronas Gene Ufland, a producer on Franklin's show.[29][30]Sharon Washington as Debra Kan, Arthur's social worker.Josh Paisas Hoyt Vaughn, Arthur's boss.[26][31]Brian Tyree Henryas Clark, a clerk atArkham State Hospital.Frank Woodas Dr.Benjamin Stoner, Penny Fleck's former therapist.[32]Ben Warheit,Michael Benz, and Carl Lundstedt as the threeWayne Investmentsemployees who harass Arthur on the subway.[33]Gary GulmanandSam Morrilas the comedians at anopen micwhere Arthur performs.[33][34]Bryan Callenas Javier, a co-worker of Arthur.[35]Justin Theroux(uncredited) as Ethan Chase, a celebrity guest on Franklin's show.[36]Production[edit]Development[edit]JokerdirectorTodd Phillipsin 2024Between 2014 and 2015,Joaquin Phoenixexpressed interest to his agent in acting in a low-budget ""character study"" type of film about acomic bookvillain, likeDC Comicscharacter theJoker,[6]before PhillipspitchedJokerin 2016.[37]Phoenix had previously declined to act in theMarvel Cinematic Universe(MCU) because he would have been required to reprise a role, such asBruce Banner / Hulk(initially portrayed byEdward Nortonbefore he was recast byMark Ruffalo) orStephen Strange / Doctor Strange(ultimately portrayed byBenedict Cumberbatch), in multiple films.[38]Phoenix ruled out the Joker for his ""character study"" idea and tried to think of a different one. ""I thought, 'You can't do the Joker, because, you know, it's just you can't do that character, it's just been done'"". Phoenix's agent suggested setting up an exploratory meeting withWarner Bros., but he declined and let go of the idea.[6]Similarly,Todd Phillipshad been offered to direct comic-based films a number of times, but declined because he thought they were ""loud"" and did not interest him. According to Phillips,Jokerspawned from his idea to create a different, more grounded comic book film.[39]He was attracted to the Joker because he did not think there was a definitive portrayal of the character, which he knew would provide considerable creative freedom.[40]Phillips pitched the idea forJokerto Warner Bros. after his filmWar Dogspremiered in August 2016.[39]Prior toWar Dogs, Phillips was mostly known for hiscomedy films, such asRoad Trip(2000),Old School(2003) andThe Hangover(2009);War Dogsmarked a venture into more unsettling territory.[41]During the premiere, Phillips realized ""War Dogswasn't going to set the world on fire and I was thinking, 'What do people really want to see?'""[39]In addition, he found that it was difficult to make comedy films in the ""wokeculture"", throughout opposition of ""30 million people onTwitter"". He finally thought that ""How do I do something irreverent, but fuck comedy? Oh I know, let's take the comic book movie universe and turn it on its head with this"".[42]He proposed thatDC Filmsdifferentiate its slate from the competingMarvel Studios' by producing low-budget,standalone films.[43][44]After the successful release ofWonder Woman(2017), DC Films decided to deemphasize thesharednature of its DC-based film franchise, theDC Extended Universe(DCEU).[45]In August 2017, Warner Bros. and DC Films revealed plans for the film, with Phillips directing and co-writing withScott SilverandMartin Scorseseset to co-produce with Phillips.[46]According to Tatiana Siegel ofThe Hollywood Reporter, Scorsese considered directingJokerbefore Phillips was chosen, though a Warner Bros. source said he only became involved because the film needed aNew York City-based producer.[47]According to Kim Masters and Borys Kit ofThe Hollywood Reporter,Jared Leto, who portrayed theJokerin the DCEU, was displeased by the existence of a project separate from his interpretation.[48][49]In October 2019, Masters reported that Leto ""felt 'alienated and upset'"" when he learned that Warner Bros.—which had promised hima standalone DCEU Joker film—let Phillips proceed withJoker, going as far as to ask his music managerIrving Azoffto get the project canceled. Masters added that Leto's irritation was what caused him to end his association withCreative Artists Agency(CAA), as he believed ""his agents should have told him about the Phillips project earlier and fought harder for his version of Joker"". However, sources associated with Leto deny that he attempted to getJokercanceled and left CAA because of it.[49]Warner Bros. pushed for Phillips to castLeonardo DiCaprioas the Joker,[41]hoping to use hisfrequent collaboratorScorsese's involvement to attract him.[48]However, Phillips said that Phoenix was the only actor he considered,[50]and that he and Silver wrote the script with Phoenix in mind, ""The goal was never to introduce Joaquin Phoenix into the comic book movie universe. The goal was to introduce comic book movies into the Joaquin Phoenix universe"".[51]Phoenix said when he learned of the film, he became excited because it was the kind he was looking to make, describing it as unique and stating it did not feel like a typical ""studio movie"".[6]It took him some time to commit to the role, as it intimidated him and he said ""oftentimes, in these movies, we have these simplified, reductive archetypes and that allows for the audience to be distant from the character, just like we would do in real life, where it's easy to label somebody as evil and therefore say, 'Well, I'm not that.'""[51]Writing[edit]It was a yearlong process from when we finished the script just to get the new people on board with this vision, because I pitched it to an entirely different team than made it. There were emails about: 'You realize we sell Joker pajamas atTarget.' There were a zillion hurdles, and you just sort of had to navigate those one at a time [...] At the time, I would curse them in my head every day. But then I have to put it in perspective and go, 'They're pretty bold that they did this.'– Todd Phillips[39]Phillips and Silver wroteJokerthroughout 2017 and the writing process took about a year.[52]According to producerEmma Tillinger Koskoff, it took some time to get approval for the script from Warner Bros., partly because of concerns over the content. Similarly, Phillips commented that there were ""a zillion hurdles"" during the year-long writing process due to the visibility of the character.[39]Phillips said that while the script's themes may reflect modern society, the film was not intended to be political.[52]He also noted thatJokeris a story about childtraumaand mental illness.[53][54]In their script, Phillips talked about how difficult it is for patients to reveal their diagnoses, referring to a line from the film: ""The worst part of having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don't"".[54]The script draws inspiration from Scorsese films such asTaxi Driver(1976),Raging Bull(1980) andThe King of Comedy(1982), as well as Phillips'Hangover Trilogy.[41][46][55]Other films Phillips has cited as inspiration include character studies released in the 1970s—such asSerpico(1973) andOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest(1975)—the silent filmThe Man Who Laughs(1928) and severalmusicals. Phillips said that aside from the tone, he did not considerJokerthat different from his previous work, such as hisHangoverfilms.[52]The film's premise was inspired byAlan MooreandBrian Bolland's graphic novelBatman: The Killing Joke(1988), which depicts the Joker as a failed stand-up comedian,[39]while the climactic talk show scene was inspired by a similar scene inFrank Miller'sThe Dark Knight Returns(1986).[56]However, Phillips said the film does not ""follow anything from the comic books... That's what was interesting to me. We're not even doing Joker, but the story of becoming Joker"".[57]Phillips later clarified that he meant they did not look to a specific comic for inspiration, but rather ""picked and chose what we liked"" from the character's history.[58]Having grown up in New York, Phillips also drew inspiration from life in New York City during the early 1980s.[59]The Subway shooting scene and its aftermath were inspired by the1984 New York City Subway shooting,[59][60]while Arthur Fleck is partially based on the shooting's perpetrator, Bernhard Goetz.[60][59]Phillips and Silver found the most common Jokerorigin story, in which the character is disfigured after falling into a vat of acid, too unrealistic.[39]Instead, they used certain elements of the Joker lore to produce an original story,[61]which Phillips wanted to feel as authentic as possible.[39]Because the Joker does not have a definitive origin story in the comics, Phillips and Silver were given considerable creative freedom and ""pushed each other every day to come up with something totally insane"".[52]While the Joker had appeared in several films before, Phillips thought it was possible to produce a new story featuring the character. ""It's just another interpretation, like people do interpretations ofMacbeth(1606)"", he toldThe New York Times.[50]However, they did try to retain the ambiguous ""multiple choice"" nature of the Joker's past by positioning the character as anunreliable narrator—with entire storylines simply being his delusions[40]—and left what mental illnesses he suffers from unclear.[41]As such, Phillips said the entire film is open to interpretation.[40]When a draft of the film's script, written in April 2018, was leaked and spread on the internet, Phillips stated that it was an old version from six months before filming began.[62]Phillips also declined to take legal action against the spread of the script, stating that he liked having an old version circulate.[63]Pre-production[edit]The logo ofJoker. Chad Danielely created the logo byletterpress, using oldwood type.[64]Following the disappointing critical and financial performance ofJustice League(2017), in January 2018Walter HamadareplacedJon Bergas the head of DC-based film production at Warner Bros.[65]Hamada sorted through the various DC films in development, canceling some while advancing work on others; the film was set to begin filming in late 2018 with a small budget of $55 million.[66]Kim Masters ofThe Hollywood Reportersaid Warner Bros. was reluctant to letJokermove forward and gave it a small budget in an effort to dissuade Phillips.[49]Phillips said that Hamada did not understand what he was trying to do.[67]By June,Robert De Nirowas under consideration for a supporting role in the film.[68]The deal with Phoenix was finalized in July 2018,[69]after four months of persuasion from Phillips.[39]Immediately afterwards,[69]Warner Bros. officiallygreen-litthe film,[70]titled itJokerand gave it an October 4, 2019, release date.[71]Warner Bros. described the film as ""an exploration of a man disregarded by society [that] is not only a gritty character study, but also a broadercautionary tale"".[72]Scorsese's longtime associate Koskoff joined to produce,[73][74]although Scorsese left his producing duties due to other obligations.[73]Scorsese considered serving as an executive producer, but was preoccupied with his filmThe Irishman(2019), which also starred De Niro.[39]It was also confirmed that the film would have no effect on Leto's Joker and would be the first in a new series of DC films unrelated to the DCEU.[75][66]In July,Zazie Beetzwas cast in a supporting role and De Niro entered negotiations in August.[11][13]Frances McDormanddeclined an offer to portray the mother of the Joker andFrances Conroywas cast.[76][16]At the end of July,Marc MaronandBryan Callenjoined the cast.[30][29][77]Alec Baldwinwas cast as Thomas Wayne on August 27, but dropped out two days later due to scheduling conflicts.[21]Baldwin also noted the character's description as a reason for his departure, which called Thomas Wayne ""a cheesy and tanned businessman who is more in the mold of a 1980sDonald Trump"".[78]Filming[edit]TheNewark Paramount Theatre. Street scenes were filmed in front of the abandoned theater inDowntown Newark, New Jersey.ANew York City SubwayCtrain with arollsignfor the fictional 0 train left over from filming forJokerPrincipal photographycommenced in September 2018 in New York City,[b]under theworking titleRomeo.[81]Shortly after filming began, De Niro, Brett Cullen, Shea Whigham, Glenn Fleshler, Bill Camp, Josh Pais and Douglas Hodge were announced to have joined the film, with Cullen replacing Baldwin.[26][82]Bradley Cooperjoined the film as a producer,[83]and the director of photography wasLawrence Sher, both of whom Phillips had previously collaborated with.[26]On September 22, a scene depicting a violent protest was filmed at theChurch Avenue stationinKensington, Brooklyn,[84]although the station was modified to look like theBedford Park Boulevard stationinthe Bronx.[85]Filming of violent scenes also took place at the abandoned lower platform of theNinth Avenue stationinSunset Park, Brooklyn.[86]According to Beetz, Phillips rewrote the entire script during production; because Phoenix lost so much weight for the film, there would not be an opportunity for reshoots. She recalled, ""we would go into Todd's trailer and write the scene for the night and then do it. During hair and makeup we'd memorize those lines and then do them and then we'd reshoot that three weeks later"".[87]Phillips recalled Phoenix sometimes walked off-set during filming because he lost self-control and needed to compose himself—to the confusion of other actors, who felt they had done something wrong. De Niro was one of the few Phoenix never walked out on and De Niro said he was ""very intense in what he was doing, as it should be, as he should be"".[88]Filming inJersey Citystarted on September 30 and shut downNewark Avenue, while filming in November, starting on November 9, shut downKennedy Boulevard. Filming inNewarkbegan on October 13 and lasted until October 16.[81]Shortly before the Newark filming,SAG-AFTRAreceived a complaint thatextraswere locked insubway carsfor more than three hours during filming in Brooklyn, a break violation. The issue was quickly resolved after a representative visited the set.[89]That month,Dante Pereira-Olsonjoined the cast as a young Bruce Wayne.[23]Whigham said towards the end of October the film was in ""the middle"" of production, adding that it was an ""intense"" and ""incredible"" experience.[28]By mid-November, filming had moved back to New York.[90]Filmingwrappedon December 3, 2018,[91]with Phillips posting a picture on hisInstagramfeed later in the month to commemorate the occasion.[92]InThe Hollywood Reporterinterview,Emma Tillinger Koskoffsaid that most stressful filming was the ""stair dance"" scene on what is now colloquially known as theJoker Stairs; because there were no laws on paparazzi inNew York City, filming was disrupted by them.[93]TheSouth Bronxstairs used for the biographical crime filmAmerican Gangster(2007) were originally to be used for these scenes, according toThe New York Times, but were deemed too repaved and beautified to be aesthetically acceptable for the film's tone.[94]Initially, Lawrence Sher and Phillips had wanted to film on 65mm film for the70mmformat, but Warner Bros. rejected this due to cost, and the film was subsequently shot withArri Alexa 65 digital cameras. Warner Bros. did however end up givingJokera limited theatrical release in converted 70mm and 35mm presentations.[95]Post-production[edit]Phillips confirmed he was in the process of editingJokerin March 2019.[96]AtCinemaConthe following month, he stated the film was ""still taking shape"" and was difficult to discuss, as he hoped to maintain secrecy.[97]Phillips also denied most reports surrounding the film, which he felt was because it is ""an origin story about a character that doesn't have a definitive origin"".[98]Brian Tyree Henry was also confirmed to have a role in the film.[31]The visual effects were provided byScanline VFXand Shade VFX and supervised by Matthew Giampa and Bryan Godwin, with Erwin Rivera serving as the overall supervisor.[99]One scene that was cut from the film depicted Sophie watching Arthur's appearance on Franklin's show. The scene was intended to show the audience that she is still alive (as the film otherwise implies that Arthur kills her), but Phillips decided it would disrupt the narrative, which is portrayed from Arthur's point of view.[100]In anotherdeleted scene, Arthur reveals his crimes to a co-worker; the scene was ultimately removed because it provided ""too much information"" in the form of exposition.[101]According to one source, the film's original script ended with Arthur carving himself aGlasgow smilein front of his crowd of supporters, but the idea got shot down by then-Warner Bros. executiveChristopher Nolan, who mandated that onlyHeath Ledger's version of theJokerfrom his filmThe Dark Knight(2008) should have a Glasgow smile.[102]The film's final budget was $55–70 million, considered byThe Hollywood Reporter""a fraction"" of the cost of a typical comic book-based film.[66][103]In comparison, the previous villain-centered DC film,Suicide Squad(2016), cost $175 million.[41]$25 million ofJoker's budget was covered by the Toronto-based financing company Creative Wealth Media, whileVillage Roadshow PicturesandBron Studioseach contributed 25%.[104][103]Jokerwas also the first live-action theatrical film in theBatmanfilm franchiseto receive anR ratingfrom theMotion Picture Association of America, officially for ""strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and brief sexual images"".[105]In the United Kingdom, theBritish Board of Film Classification(BBFC) gave the film a 15 certificate for ""strong bloody violence [and] language"".[1]Design[edit]Set[edit]Gotham CityinJokerwas set in the 1980s in a New York City esque Gotham, according to Todd Phillips, ""to separate it, quite frankly, from the DC universe"".[106]Mark Friedberg, the production designer of this film, said he established the filming location of Gotham Square inNewarkas a film set because there was still poverty.[107]He wanted Gotham to look like a gritty city, as described inTaxi Driver(1976), so he named all structures and lines in this film and drew a specific map of Gotham city.[108]He displayed 1970s brightly coloredmuscle carson the set, ""conveying dissonance and being awful and beautiful at the same time"". He also tried to describe Gotham as a decaying city through graffiti, garbage on the road and cracked sidewalks.[109][110]The VFX team added fictional buildings, changing the skyline of the city to give the sense that the city was pressing down on Arthur.[111]Lawrence Shersaidsodium-vapor lightswere used in this film, representing Arthur's isolation and his more hopeful side.[112]Arch bridge inBrooklyn Army Terminal, used to depict the exterior ofArkham State Hospital.Arkham State Hospital is based onArkham Asylum.[36]Warner Bros. Korea explained that it is a more realistic name in the real world.[113]The exterior of Arkham State hospital was filmed atBrooklyn Army Terminal,[114]while the interior was pictured inMetropolitan Hospital CenterofHarlem.[115]Throughout the film, two walls are shown inside Arkham State Hospital; one is clearly white in the first and last scenes, the other is dirty yellow in the scene in which Arthur runs with a medical report. This difference was intended to make the audience confused and to question the possibility that Arthur had been in hospital the entire time.[36][113]Character design[edit]One of the most important inspirations for Arthur's behavior came from the Little Tramp inModern Times(1936), while his ""ridiculous"" movement was inspired byCharlie Chaplin.[36][111]Arthur's dance was influenced by that ofRay Bolger, and his gesture of making a smile from two fingers was from theScarecrowinThe Wizard of Oz(1939).[42][116]In preparation, Phoenix ate a single sparse meal per day for 8 months, losing 52 pounds (24 kg) to look ""wolf-like and malnourished and hungry"",[39][117][8]and watched videos of people suffering frompathological laughterto refine his own laughter for the role.[118]He sought to portray a character whom audiences could not relate to and did not look to previous Joker actors for inspiration; instead, he read a book about political assassinations so he could understand killers and their motivations.[5]Phillips identified Arthur's normal face as being his ""real mask"", while Joker served as his true personality.[119]He had also identified the genuine laugh occurring only in the last scene.[120]DirectorTodd Phillipssaid that he intentionally left it ambiguous as to whether Arthur becomes the Joker of traditionalBatmanstories or inspires a separate character,[40]although Phoenix believes that Arthur is the former.[121][122]Make-up and costumes[edit]Nicki Ledermannand Kay Georgiou, the makeup designer and hairstylist tried to show Arthur Fleck to ""be handmade and realistic"". Georgiou designated Arthur as a man with unwashed hair. Arthur's costumes, designed byMark Bridges, were matched to look ""aged, overdyed and distressed"" through wearing him with cheap polyester pants and an acrylic sweater. His color palette was inspired by the aesthetics of the 1980s: blue, maroon, brown, mauve and gray.[123]Bridges explained Arthur's costume color started from a ""juvenile mode"" and later changing to align with the tone of the film.[124]In the first scene, Arthur's ""too small"" hooded jacket and white socks emphasizes the childish concept, being a reflection of him living with his mother Penny, with her calling him ""my little boy"",[123]and the influence ofCharlie Chaplin.[125]However, he wore a charcoal sweater during the scene in which he is interviewed by the social worker and finally wore a ""scab-colored knit top"" in Arkham State Hospital.[124]A line depicting his old suit for many years was interpreted a mustard-toned vest and a patterned bottle-green shirt.[123]After turning Arthur into Joker, his design was also changed. His hair was dyed ""broccoli"" green and he wore a suit similar to the one in the originalBatmanseries.[123][124]However, the Joker suit in this film had different colors compared to previous films (purple suit with a green or yellow shirt). Mark Bridges noted that it was result of Phillips' intention to not want to be ""connected to anything else"". Initially, the color of the suit in the script was set toterracotta, but Bridges changed this to red to give ""more expressive"" emotion. Additionally, his suit colors (green, yellow, purple and red) were contrasted with those of his antagonists, including Thomas Wayne, giving them to gray and blue like Batman. Clown makeup was drawn with a classic, antique feel, with darker colors and tones and menacing eyebrows. Due to copyright laws stating that no two clowns can look alike, Ledermann faced a challenge.[123]Music[edit]Main article:Joker (soundtrack)In August 2018,Hildur Guðnadóttirwas hired to compose the film's score.[126]Hildur began writing music after reading the script and meeting with Phillips, who ""had a lot of strong ideas"" about how he thought the score should sound. She worked on theJokerscore alongside the score for the drama miniseriesChernobyl; Hildur toldThe Hindu's Divya-Kala Bhavani switching between the two was challenging because the scores were so different.[127]Additionally, the film features the songs ""That's Life"", ""Send In the Clowns"", ""White Room"" and ""Rock and Roll Part 2"".[41][128]The use of ""Rock and Roll Part 2"" generated controversy when it was initially reported that its singer, convicted child sex offenderGary Glitter, would receive royalties,[129]but it was later confirmed he would not, as he had long since sold the rights; the US rights to the song are now owned byUniversal Music Publishing Group.[128]The score was released on October 2, 2019, byWaterTower Music.[130]Hildur's music won numerous awards including anAcademy Award, aSatellite Award, aSaturn Award, theHollywood Music in Media Awards(HMMA) and theGolden Globe Award for Best Original Score, with the latter making her the first woman to win as a solo composer in that category.[131][132]Marketing[edit]Phillips promotedJokerby posting on set photos on his Instagram account.[133]On September 21, 2018, he released test footage of Phoenix in-costume as the Joker, with ""Laughing"" byThe Guess Whoaccompanying the footage.[134]At CinemaCon on April 2, 2019, Phillips unveiled the first trailer for the film,[31]which was released online the following day.[135]The trailer, prominently featuring the song ""Smile"" performed byJimmy Durante, generated positive responses, with some commentators comparing it toTaxi DriverandRequiem for a Dream(2000) and praising Phoenix's performance.[136][137]Writers described the trailer as dark and gritty,[138]with ComicBook.com's Jenna Anderson feeling it appeared more like apsychological thrillerthan a comic book film.[31]ActorMark Hamill, who hasvoicedthe Joker since the cartoonBatman: The Animated Series(1992–1995), expressed enthusiasm onTwitter.[citation needed]Conversely,io9's Germain Lussier said the trailer revealed too little and that it was too similar to photos Phillips had posted on Instagram. While he still believed it exhibited potential, Lussier overall thought the trailer was not ""a home run"".[139]The trailer received over eight million views in the first few hours of release.[140]On August 25, 2019, Phillips released six brief teasers that contained flashes of writing, revealing the second trailer would be released on August 28.[141]FilmmakerKevin Smithcommended the trailer, stating he thought the film ""would still work even if [DC Comics] didn't exist"" and praising its uniqueness.[142]Overall,Deadline Hollywoodestimated that Warner Bros. spent $120 million on promotion and advertisements.[103]After release in theaters, Warner Bros. used negative critics on this film for promotion.[143]Release[edit]Theatrical[edit]Joaquin Phoenix(left) at the76th Venice International Film Festival, whereJokerpremieredJokerhad its world premiere at the76th Venice International Film Festivalon August 31, 2019, where it received an eight-minutestanding ovationand won the Golden Lion award.[144][145]It also screened at theToronto International Film Festivalon September 9, 2019.[146]The film was released theatrically by Warner Bros.

A separate memo revealed the Army received ""credible"" information from Texas law enforcement ""regarding the targeting of an unknown movie theater during the release"".[151]The film, forbidden to minors under 17 in the US, was feared to possibly encourage imitations of the criminal behaviors represented in the film in ordinary life.[152]However, according toDeadline Hollywood, theFBIand theUnited States Department of Homeland Securityfound no credible threats surrounding the release of the film.[153]In an interview withTheWrap, Phillips expressed surprise at criticism of the film's dark tone, stating ""it's because outrage is a commodity"" and calling critics of the film ""far left"".[154]Phoenix walked out of an interview byThe Telegraphwhen asked if the film could inspire mass shooters. He later returned to finish the interview, but did not answer the question.[155][8]Following this, journalists were disinvited from the premiere atTCL Chinese Theatre, with only photographers being allowed to interact with the filmmakers and cast on the carpet. In a statement toVariety, Warner Bros. said that ""A lot has been said aboutJokerand we just feel it's time for people to see the film"".[156][157]The film did not play at theAurora, Coloradomovie theater where the2012 mass shootingoccurred during a screening ofThe Dark Knight Rises(2012).[158]Three families of victims, as well as the mother of a witness, signed a letter to Warner Bros. with the request.[159]Additionally,Landmark Theatersprohibited moviegoers from wearing Joker costumes during its run, while theLos AngelesandNew York City Police Departmentsincreased police visibility at area theaters, though they did not receive ""any specific threat"".[160][17]Ultimately, despite the aforementioned concerns, screenings of the film proceeded and concluded with no reports of violent incidents.[161]Home media[edit]Jokerwas released onDigital HDon December 17, 2019, and onDVD,Blu-rayandUltra HD Blu-rayon January 7, 2020.[162]It debuted on HBO on May 16, 2020, and onHBO Maxwhen it launched on May 27, 2020.[163]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]Jokergrossed $335.5 million in the United States and Canada and $743.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.079 billion.[2][3]It is thesixth-highest-grossing film of 2019and thesecond highest-grossing R-rated filmof all time,[164][165]as well as the first and only R-rated film to pass the billion-dollar mark untilDeadpool & Wolverinein 2024.[166]In terms of budget-to-gross ratio,Jokeris also the most profitable film based on a comic book,[167]due to its small budget and little decline in week-to-week grosses during its theatrical run, surpassing the record previously held byDeadpool(2016).[168]Deadline Hollywoodestimated the film made a net profit of $437 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.[169]In August 2019,Boxoffice Proanalyst Shawn Robbins wrote that he expectedJokerto gross $60–90 million during its opening weekend in North America.[170]Following the film's premiere,BoxOfficepredictedJokercould open to $70–95 million domestically.[171]Later updating to $85–105 million, Robbins suggested it could become the first October release to open to over $100 million and surpass the record set byVenom(2018).[172]However,Comscore's senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian thought the film would open closer to $50 million because it is not a ""typical comic-book movie"".[173]Three weeks prior to its release, official industry tracking projected the film would debut to $65–80 million, with some estimates going as high as $90 million.[174]The week of its release, Atom Tickets announced pre-sale totals for the film were outpacing those ofVenomandIt Chapter Two($91.1 million debut) and thatJokerwas its second-best-selling R-rated film of 2019 behindJohn Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum.[175]Jokeropened in 4,374 theaters in North America and made $39.9 million on its first day of release, including $13.3 million from Thursday night previews, bestingVenom's respective October records.[103]The film also had the biggest October opening day of any film, beating outHalloween(2018).[176]It went on to breakVenom's record for having the biggest October opening weekend, finishing with a domestic total of $96.2 million. The film set career records for Phoenix, Phillips and De Niro and was the fourth-largest debut for an R-rated film of all time.[177]The latter record would cross overThe Matrix Reloaded(2003), staying behindDeadpool,Deadpool 2(2018) andIt(2017).[178]It was also Warner Bros.' biggest domestic opening in two years.[179]In its second weekend, the film fell just 41.8% to $55.9 million, remaining in first and marking the best second-weekend October total (bestingGravity(2013)'s $43.1 million in 2013).[180]It made $29.2 million in its third weekend and $19.2 million in its fourth, finishing second behindMaleficent: Mistress of Evilboth times.[181][182]After 155 days,Joker's American theatrical run wrapped up on March 5, 2020, with a final gross of $355.5 million, making it the fourth-highest domestic gross for an R-rated film, behindThe Passion of the Christ(2004),DeadpoolandAmerican Sniper(2014).[183]Worldwide, the film was projected to debut to around $155 million, including $75 million from 73 overseas territories.[184]It made $5.4 million from four countries on its first day and $18.7 million from 47 in its second, for a two-day total of $24.6 million. It went on to greatly exceed expectations, making $140.5 million from overseas territories and a total $234 million worldwide. Its largest markets were South Korea (a Warner Bros. record $16.3 million), the United Kingdom ($14.8 million), Mexico ($13.1 million) and Japan ($7 million).[185]With this, it became the biggest worldwide opening for an October film.[179]During its second weekend, the film made an additional $125.7 million worldwide,[186]and $77.9 million in its third.[187]By this point, industry analysts expectedJokerto become the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, with some suggesting that it could finish its run with over $1 billion.[188]The film became the highest-grossing R-rated film in its fourth weekend, during which it grossed $47.8 million internationally,[189]and passed the billion-dollar mark about a month into its theatrical release.[166]Critical response[edit]Onreview aggregatorRotten Tomatoes,Jokerholds an approval rating of 68% based on 603 reviews, with an average rating of 7.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads, ""Jokergives its infamous central character a chillingly plausible origin story that serves as a brilliant showcase for its star – and a dark evolution for comics-inspired cinema.""[190]Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 59 out of 100 based on 60 critics, indicating ""mixed or average"" reviews.[191]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale, while those atPostTrakgave it an overall positive score of 84% (with an average 4 out of 5 stars) and a 60% ""definite recommend"".[103]Mark KermodeofThe Observerrated the film 4 out of 5 stars, stating ""Jokerhas an ace card in the form of Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerisingly physical portrayal of a man who would be king"".[192]Writing forIGN, Jim Vejvoda gaveJokera perfect score, saying that the film ""would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliantBatman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake"". He found it a powerful and unsettling allegory of contemporary neglect and violence and described Phoenix's performance as the Joker as engrossing and ""Oscar-worthy"".[193]Similarly, Xan Brooks ofThe Observer—who also gave the film a perfect score—called it ""gloriously daring and explosive"" and appreciated how Phillips used elements from Scorsese films to create an original story.[194]Variety'sOwen Gleibermanwrote, ""Phoenix is astonishing as a mentally ill geek who becomes the killer-clown Joker in Todd Phillips' neo-Taxi Driverknockout: the rare comic-book movie that expresses what's happening in the real world"".[195]ComicBook.com's Brandon Davis acclaimedJokeras a groundbreaking comic book adaptation that he found scarier than most 2019horror films. Davis compared it favorably to the 2008BatmanfilmThe Dark Knight, praised the cinematography and performances and called it a film that needed to be seen to be believed.[196]Deadline Hollywood's Pete Hammond believes the film redefines the Joker and is ""impossible to shake off"". Hammond also praised the story and performances and summarized the film as ""a bravura piece of filmmaking that speaks to the world we are actually living in today in ways that few movies do"".[197]Peter TraversofRolling Stonesaid he was lost for words in describing Phoenix's performance, calling the film ""gut-wrenching"" and ""simply stupendous"".[198]David Ehrlich ofIndieWirewas more mixed and gave the film a ""C+"". He felt that while ""Jokeris the boldest and most exciting superhero movie sinceThe Dark Knight"", it was ""also incendiary, confused and potentially toxic"". Ehrlich thought that the film would make DC fans happy and praised Phoenix's performance, but criticized Phillips' direction and the lack of originality.[199]A critical review came from Glenn Kenny ofRogerEbert.com, who gave the film two stars out of four. Though he praised the performances and thought the story worked, Kenny criticized the social commentary and Phillips' direction, finding the film too derivative and believing its focus was ""less in entertainment than in generating self-importance"".[200]In an analysis of the character Joker,Onmanorama's Sajesh Mohan wrote that the movie was cliché-ridden, the only original part being Joaquin Phoenix's acting. ""The movie, with great pain and in detail, explains how Arthur Fleck turns into Joker dejected by the way the world treats him. Thanks to Phillips and Silver, Phoenix was able to bring out the king among the Jokers"", the analysis read.[201]Stephanie ZacharekofTime, in a negative review, labeled Phoenix's performance over-the-top and felt that while Phillips tried to ""[give] us a movie all about the emptiness of our culture ... he's just offering a prime example of it"". She argued the plot was nonexistent, ""dark only in a stupidly adolescent way"" and ""stuffed with phony philosophy"".[202]Meanwhile,NPR'sGlen Weldonthought the film lacked innovation and said its sympathetic take on the Joker was ""wildly unconvincing and mundanely uninteresting"". Weldon also describedJokeras trying too hard to deviate from the comics and, as a result, coming off as an imitation of films likeTaxi Driver.[203]Peter BradshawofThe Guardiancalled it ""the most disappointing film of the year"". While praising Phoenix's performance and the first act, he criticized the film's political plot developments and overall found it too derivative of various Scorsese films.[204]Industry response[edit]Jokergenerated positive responses from industry figures. DC Comics chief creative officerJim Leepraised it as ""intense, raw and soulful"" and stated that it had remained true to the character despite deviating from the source material.[205][206]ActorMark Hamill, who has voiced the Joker in animation and video games sinceBatman: The Animated Series(1992–1995), thought the film had ""brilliantly"" reinvented the character and gave it ""[two] thumbs up"".[207]Superman(1978) directorRichard Donnercalled the film ""brilliant"", ""fascinating"", ""really well-written"" and stated that Phoenix's performance was ""genius"".[208]Documentary filmmakerMichael MoorecalledJokera ""cinematic masterpiece"" and stated it was a ""danger to society"" if people did not see it.[209]ActorJosh Brolinfound the film powerful: ""To appreciateJokerI believe you have to have either gone through something traumatic in your lifetime (and I believe most of us have) or understand somewhere in your psyche what true compassion is"".[210]ActorVincent D'Onofriovocally commended Phoenix's performance in the film on Twitter, stating that he ""deserve[d] recognition for this performance"", while actressJessica Chastainagreed, replying: ""It's one of the greatest pieces of acting I've ever seen"".[211]Actress and screenwriterPhoebe Waller-Bridgealso praised the film, stating: ""I think the reason people got so uncomfortable [with the film] is because it feels too true, too raw. I was watching it and thinking to myself, God, if this came out a year into[Barack] Obama's time in office, I don't think we'd be feeling as worried about it"".[212]FilmmakerDavid Finchersaid of the film's unexpected success, ""Nobody would have thought they had a shot at a giant hit withJokerhadThe Dark Knightnot been as massive as it was. I don't think anyone would have looked at that material and thought, 'Yeah, let's take [Taxi Driver's]Travis Bickleand [The King of Comedy's] Rupert Pupkin and conflate them, then trap him in a betrayal of the mentally ill and trot it out for a billion dollars'"".[213]ActorBrendan Gleesonfelt that Phoenix's performance as the Joker was absolutely ""indelible"" and one of the most magnificent achievements in cinema he has ever seen, incidentally being that the reason he opted to join the film's sequelJoker: Folie à Deux(2024) as Jackie Sullivan.[214]FilmmakerRidley Scott, who had previously worked with Phoenix inGladiator(2000), felt ""blown away"" by the film; while he disliked the apparent way it celebrated violence, Scott felt that Phoenix's performance was remarkable enough to make Phoenix an ""amazing asset"" for his filmNapoleon(2023) in a ""creative and commercial sense"".[215]Accolades[edit]Main article:List of accolades received byJoker(2019 film)DirectorTodd Phillipsholding theGolden Lion, awarded toJokerat the76th Venice International Film Festival.In September 2019,Jokerwas awarded theGolden Lion, the festival's highest prize, at the76th Venice International Film Festival.[216]At the92nd Academy Awards, the film won theBest Actor(Phoenix) andBest Original Scoreawards.

Robinson said the film ""walks a fine line between exploration and validation"" of Joker's character and is ""ultimately an in-your-face examination of a broken system that creates its own monsters.""[229]Some writers have expressed concern thatJoker's sympathetic portrayal of a homicidal maniac could inspire real-world violence.[230][231]Richard LawsonofVanity Fairfound the film was too sympathetic towards ""white men who commit heinous crimes"" and that the sociopolitical ideologies represented in the film are ""evils that are far more easily identifiable"" to people ""who shoot up schools and concerts and churches, who gun down the women and men they covet and envy, who let loose some spirit of anarchic animus upon the world—there's almost awoebegonemythos placed on them in the search for answers.""[232]Jim Geraghty ofNational Reviewwrote he was ""worried that a certain segment of America's angry, paranoid, emotionally unstable young men will watch Joaquin Phoenix descending into madness and a desire to get back at society by hurting as many people as possible and exclaim, 'finally, somebody understands me!'""[233]Contrarily, Michael Shindler, reviewing the film inMere Orthodoxy, while agreeing thatJokerdepicts a sympathetic wish fulfillment fantasy, contends (drawing on insights fromSigmund FreudandJacques Lacan) that it is for precisely that reason that the film will, if anything, preemptively quell real-world violence by rendering ""the Flecks of the world into meeksomnambulists"".[234]BritishneurocriminologistAdrian Rainewas impressed by how accurate the film's depiction of the psychology of a murderer was. In an interview withVanity Fair, he described it as ""a great educational tool"" and stated that he planned to present film clips during his classes.[235]Psychiatrist Kamran Ahmed highlighted the factors in Arthur's childhood such as parental abuse and loss and family history of mental illness in the genesis of his condition.[236]AmericanpsychiatristImani Walker, who is known for herBravotelevision seriesMarried to Medicine Los Angelesand working with violent criminals withmental disorders, analyzed the Joker's apparent mental disorders and circumstances and noted that Arthur tries to find help before his downfall, only to be abandoned. She says of Arthur and others in poverty who have mental illness: ""We as a society don't even pretend that they're real people and that's what this movie is about. He never had a chance.""[237]Forensic psychiatrist Ziv Cohen criticized the film as misrepresenting the mentally ill as violent.[238]He argued the film conflates psychopathy (a lack of conscience) with mental illness, thereby creating a false impression of the mentally ill as dangerous.[238]Micah Uetricht, managing director ofJacobin, opined in a review published byThe Guardianthat he was shocked that the media did not understand the movie's message: ""we got a fairly straightforward condemnation of Americanausterity: how it leaves the vulnerable to suffer without the resources they need and the horrific consequences for the rest of society that can result""; Uetricht thus declares thatJokerpresents a world that has devolved into ""barbarism"".[239]Uetricht states that these themes are unsubtle to the extent that it was surprising that most media outlets had not identified them.[239]Ahmed also highlights the lack of funding for already-stretched mental health services worldwide being alluded to.[236]Alison Willmore wrote inVulturethat the film has ""impossible"" and ""deliberately contradictory"" politics.[240]The film's director and co-screenwriter, Todd Phillips, has stated thatJokeris ""certainly not a political film"".[241]Phillips has also commented on discourse surrounding the film, pushing back on several criticisms of its themes. He responded to critics who have expressed concerns over the film's violence, saying ""Isn't it good to have these discussions about these movies, about violence? Why is that a bad thing if the movie does lead to a discourse about it?"" Phillips also commented on political backlash to the film, saying ""What's outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It's really been eye-opening for me.""[242]Cultural impact[edit]Mural depictingChileanpresidentSebastián Piñeraas the Joker during the2019–2022 Chilean protestsDuring aFive Star Movementevent in October 2019, Italian comedian and politicianBeppe Grillogave a speech wearing the Joker's makeup.[243]Yusuke Kawai, a candidate for governor ofChiba Prefecture, appeared onNHKwith a Joker costume in 2021.[244]References to the character were also found in anti-government protests worldwide.[245][246]During the17 October Revolution, a group of graffiti artists called Ashekm painted a mural of the Joker holding a Molotov cocktail and it was also reported that there was a Joker facepaint station at the protests inBeirut.[245]InLos Ángeles, Chile, during the2019–2022 Chilean protests, the phrase ""We are all clowns"", which is adopted by Gotham City protesters in the movie, was written at the foot of a statue.[245][246]InHong Kong, protesters challenged anemergency decreeprohibiting the wearing of masks by wearing those of fictional characters such as the Joker.[245]In France, during theYellow Vest Protests, firefighters donned Joker makeup holding placards.[247]In 2020, during theGeorge Floyd protests, Argentine presidentAlberto Fernándezcompared the pictures of the protests to those seen in the film.[248]One of the locations seen in the film, a set of stairs in the Bronx, New York City, has been dubbed theJoker Stairs. The stairs have become a tourist destination and the subject ofInternet memes, with visitors often reenacting the scene from the film in which Fleck dances down the stairs in his Joker attire.[249][250]Ukrainian boxing championOleksandr Usykwore a suit resembling that of Joker in a pre-fight press conference leading up to his fight withAnthony Joshua.[251]In 2020,Deadline Hollywoodlisted it as one of the ""21 Most Influential Films Of The 21st Century, So Far,"" with Pete Hammond describing it as a film ""that emerged from a comic book to become a frightening comment on our own dark times, proving the genre from which it came is capable of being taken very seriously indeed.""[252]It also ranked 39 onEmpire's list of the ""100 Greatest Movies of the 21st Century,"" saying that ""it represented another mature evolution for the comic book movie – and proved that DC adaptations could thrive outside the Marvel-style universe structure.""[253]Following theshootingof theUnitedHealthcareCEOBrian Thompsonin 2024, comparisons were made to the film, such as how the suspected shooterLuigi Mangionebecame revered by the public following decades of grievances with the American healthcare system and people comparing Thompson's death to the deaths of Franklin Murray and Thomas Wayne at the hands of Arthur Fleck and his supporters in the film.[254][255][256]In 2023, a Japanese man was sentenced to a 23-year prison sentence for stabbing a train passenger, imitating the scene in which Arthur murders the threeWayne Investmentsemployees who harass him on the subway.[257]Sequel[edit]Main article:Joker: Folie à DeuxJokerwas intended to be a stand-alone film with no sequels but Warner Bros.greenlita follow-up project.[97][258]Joker: Folie à Deux, with Phoenix and Beetz reprising their roles andLady Gagajoining asHarley Quinn, was released on October 4, 2024, to negative reviews and a poor commercial performance.[259][260]Notes[edit]^Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice – Ultimate Edition, released in 2016, received an R rating and was given a limited theatrical release, but was ultimately intended for home media release.^While the filming start date was scheduled for September 10,[79]Phillips suggested in anInstagrampost that production began on September 2.[80]References[edit]^ab""Joker(15)"".BBFC.

A prequel film titledFuriosa: A Mad Max Sagawas released on 24 May 2024, with Miller returning as writer and director.Plot[edit]Max Rockatanskyis captured by cult leaderImmortan Joe's War Boys and taken to his fortress called the Citadel. Max, auniversal donor, is forced totransfusehis blood to Nux, a sick War Boy.[12]Meanwhile, Joe sends his lieutenantImperator Furiosain the armoured ""War Rig"" to tradeproduceand water for petrol and ammunition with two of his allies, the Bullet Farmer and the People Eater. When Joe realises his five ""wives"" are fleeing in the Rig, he leads his entire army in pursuit, calling on his allies to help. Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car, and a chasing battle ensues. After entering enemy territory and fending off a rival gang, Furiosa drives into a sandstorm and loses all of her pursuers except Nux, who attempts tosacrifice himselfto blow up the Rig. Max frees himself and restrains Nux, and Furiosa destroys Nux's car.After the sandstorm, Max catches Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by Joe's ""wives"": Toast, Capable, Cheedo, the Dag, and Angharad, the latter two being pregnant with Joe's children. Max fights and subdues Furiosa, but her enginekill switchprevents him from stealing the Rig. Max begrudgingly agrees to help Furiosa's group escape Joe's wrath. Nux sneaks onto the Rig and attempts to kill Furiosa, but the women overpower him and throw Nux out. Nux rejoins Joe's army when it catches up. Furiosa drives through a canyon controlled by abiker gang, having prearranged to trade petrol for safe passage. The bikers betray her when they spot Joe's army approaching, forcing her to flee.The bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe and pursue the Rig as Max and Furiosa fend them off. Joe drives over the blockade in amonster truckand catches up with the Rig. He sends Nux to carjack the Rig, but Nux stumbles and drops his weapon, to Joe's disgust. While helping Max, Angharad falls off the Rig, and Joe fatally runs her over. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig and consoles him. At night, Furiosa and Max drive through a swamp and get stuck in the mud. They slow Joe's forces with landmines, but the Bullet Farmer continues the pursuit in hisATV. Furiosa and Max work together to blind the Bullet Farmer and disable his ATV. Moved by Capable's compassion, Nux joins the group and helps get the Rig moving again.In the morning, Furiosa tells Max that her group is escaping to a ""Green Place"", the bountiful land where she grew up before being kidnapped and brought to the Citadel. She spots a Green Place watchtower and identifies herself to the watchwoman, who summons their matriarchal clan called the Vuvalini. The Vuvalini recognise Furiosa as one of their own but inform a devastated Furiosa that the Green Place was the now-uninhabitable swamp from the previous night and that only seven Vuvalini are left. The group decides to ride across an immensesalt flat, hoping to find a new home on the other side. Max goes his own way. After seeing a vision of a child he was unable to save,[13][14]Max catches up with the group and convinces them to return to the Citadel since they do not know what lies beyond the salt flat, but do know that the now-undefended Citadel has ample water and crops.Joe intercepts them, and in the ensuing battle, five Vuvalini are killed, Toast is captured, and Furiosa is severely wounded. Joe overtakes the Rig as they approach the canyon. While Max fights Joe's son and enforcer Rictus, Furiosa boards Joe's truck to rescue Toast, who distracts Joe, allowing Furiosa to kill him. The remnants of the group drive Joe's truck back to the Citadel, while Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig to block the canyon behind them, killing Rictus. Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life.Back at the Citadel, the people rejoice upon learning of Joe's death. As Max's companions are lifted to Joe's cliffside fortress, Max and Furiosa glance at each other before Max disappears into the crowd.Cast[edit]Cast and crew attending the premiere of the film at the2015 Cannes Film FestivalTom Hardyas""Mad Max"" Rockatansky, a former police officerCharlize TheronasImperator Furiosa, a woman with a prosthetic left arm with whom Max alliesNicholas Houltas Nux, a sickly War Boy who Max is briefly chained toHugh Keays-ByrneasImmortan Joe, the ruler of the CitadelJosh Helmanas Slit, Nux's lancerNathan Jonesas Rictus Erectus, Joe's muscular, unintelligent sonRosie Huntington-Whiteleyas The Splendid Angharad, a barefoot woman who is Joe's most ""treasured"" breeder.

J. Voeten (who was also first assistant director).[15]Development[edit]Mad Max: Fury Roadhad alengthy gestation period. In 1987,George Millerhad the idea of making aMad Maxinstalment that was ""almost a continuous chase"".[16]He got an idea for the plot in 1998 when he was walking across a street in Los Angeles, and about a year later, while travelling from Los Angeles to Australia, a story in which ""violent marauders were fighting, not for oil or for material goods, but for human beings"" coalesced.[citation needed]Miller said he worked with fivestoryboard artiststo design the film instoryboardform before writing the screenplay, producing about 3,500 panels, which is almost the same as the number of shots as in the finished film, as he wanted the film to be almost a continuous chase, with relatively little dialogue, and to have the visuals come first.[17]The screenplay was written withNico Lathourisand cult British comic creatorBrendan McCarthy, who also designed many of the new characters and vehicles.[18]The film entered pre-production at20th Century Foxin the early 2000s and was set to starMel Gibson, who had portrayedMax Rockatanskyin the first three films in the series, withSigourney Weavercontemplated for the female co-lead which would later becomeImperator Furiosa, suggested by Gibson himself after they had worked together inPeter Weir'sThe Year of Living Dangerously, and Miller agreed on the idea. However, production was indefinitely postponed after theSeptember 11 attacksin 2001 caused ""the American dollar [to collapse] against the Australian dollar, and our budget ballooned"",[19]as Miller has said in several interviews since the film was released in 2015,[10][20]or due to security concerns and tightened travel and shipping restrictions during the lead up to theIraq Warcaused issues with the proposedNamibianshoot, as had been reported previously.[21][22][23]In either event, Miller said he then ""had to commit toHappy Feetbecause we had the digital facility booked to do it"", and by the time he got back to work on theMad Maxproject four years later, Gibson ""had all that turbulence in his life"".[19]Both Miller and Gibson himself said the passage of time had made Gibson's age a factor, since the film ""wasn't about an old road warrior"".[19]In 2006, Miller said he was thinking about makingFury Roadwithout Gibson.[21][24]He confirmed his intention to make anotherMad Maxfilm in 2007 and stated that he thought Gibson was focused on his own films and was also ""too old"" to play the part.[25][26]On 5 March 2009, it was announced that anR-ratedanimated feature film inspired by Japaneseanime, but adapted for Western audiences, was in pre-production that would be taking much of the plot fromFury Roadand would not feature Gibson's voice.[27]Miller was also developing an action-adventuretie-invideo game based on the fourth film withGod of War IIdesignerCory Barlog. Both projects were expected to take two to two-and-a-half years and, according to Miller, would be released in 2011 or 2012.[27]The animatedFury Roadwas going to be produced byDr D Studios, a digital art studio founded in 2008 by Miller andDoug Mitchell.[27]On 18 May 2009, it was reported that location scouting was underway forFury Road, which ""could go into production later this year"".[28]Miller had decided to shoot a live-action film after all, and ""already had the various vehicles built for years now – as they were built for the doomedFury Roadshoot"".[28]By this time, the project had moved from Fox toWarner Bros.[10]In October, Miller announced that principal photography onFury Roadwould commence atBroken Hill, New South Walesin August 2010.[29]That same month, British actorTom Hardywas in negotiations to take the lead role of Max, and it was also announced thatCharlize Theronwould play a major role.[30]The finalists for the part of Max were Hardy,Armie Hammer, andJeremy Renner, withMichael Fassbender,Joel Kinnaman,Heath Ledger,Eric Bana, andEminem(who did not wish to leave the United States) all having been considered at various stages of the film's extended development.[20][31][32]Hardy announced he had been cast onFriday Night with Jonathan Rossin June 2010.[33]In July 2010, Miller announced plans to shoot twoMad Maxfilms back-to-back, entitledMad Max: Fury RoadandMad Max: Furiosa.[34]Weta Digitalwas involved with the film when it was scheduled for a 2012 release.[35]The company was to handle visual effects until production was postponed from its November 2010 start date.[36]Specialty physical effects houseWētā Workshopprovided conceptual designs, early character look development, prototyping and specialty make-up effects.[37]After unexpected heavy rains causedwildflowersto grow in the desert around Broken Hill, filming was moved from Broken Hill back to Namibia in November 2011.[38]Other potential locations scouted included theAtacama Desertin Chile,Chott el Djeridin Tunisia, andAzerbaijan.[39]Miller said he did not feel he had to top the production design of the previous films in the series. Instead, he wanted the design to harken back to the earlier films and reflect the changes of the past 30 years.Colin Gibson, theproduction designer, said the filmmakers developed an internally consistent history to explain the film's look and justify its use ofhot rods.[40]He designed the vehicles in the film, some of which were constructed as early as 2003,[41]and all of which were fully functional.[42]Of the 150 vehicles constructed, only 88 survived to the end of filming, with the others built to facilitate their intended method of destruction.[43]The War Rig, the film's most prominent vehicle, was made by combining aTatra 815andChevrolet Fleetmasterand fusing aVolkswagen Beetleto the hull, among other modifications.[43][44]The cars were designed with an emphasis on detail and characterisation, and effort was made to show the various characters' attempts to recycle the remains of civilisation and their feelings of guilt and loss.[42]Filming[edit]DirectorGeorge Millerduring the shooting of the film in 2012CinematographerJohn Sealecame out of retirement to shootFury Road,[45]replacingDean Semler, the cinematographer of the previous twoMad Maxfilms, who left the film near the end of its preparation period.[46]It was the first project Seale filmed with digital cameras.[46]He outfitted his crew with sixArri AlexaPluses and four Alexa Ms, as well as a number ofCanon EOS 5DsandOlympus PEN E-P5sthat were used as crash cams for the action sequences;[47]as the Canon cameras were simple consumer-grade ones, when one would break, the crew would simply source new ones locally from an airport store.[48]Because of the fast-paced editing style Miller intended for the film, he asked Seale to keep the point of interest of each shot in the centre of the frame so the audience did not have to search for it.[49]Principal photographybegan in July 2012 in Namibia,[20]with most of the filming based in theDorob National Park.[50]Some scenes were also shot at theCape Town Film StudiosinCape Town, South Africa.[51][52]In October 2012,The Hollywood Reporterreported that Warner Bros. sent an executive to Namibia to keep the production on track.[53]Filming wrapped on 8 December 2012, although the opening and closing scenes at the Citadel had still not been shot.[20]A draft from theNamibian Coast Conservation and Management Projectthat accused the producers of damaging parts of theNamibdesert, endangering a number of plant and animal species, was leaked in February 2013.[54][55]The Namibia Film Commission said it had ""no reservations"" after visiting the set during production and disputed claims reported in the media, calling the accusations ""unjust rhetoric"".[56]Filming went over budget and producers forced the film to wrap before any of the Citadel scenes had been shot. A change of leadership at Warner Bros. later allowed production to continue and the missing scenes be filmed.[57]In September 2013, it was announced that the film would addpick-upsof the opening and closing scenes at the Citadel. Filming continued on 22 November 2013 atPotts HillandPenrith LakesinWestern Sydney,[58]and concluded in December 2013 atFox Studios Australia.[51][59]Miller invited playwrightEve Enslerto act as an on-set adviser. Impressed with the script's depth and what she saw as feminist themes, she spent a week in Namibia, where she spoke to the actors about issues ofviolence against women.[60]According to Miller, 90% of the effects in the film were achievedpractically.[61]Both the Doof Wagon and the Doof Warrior's guitar are fully functional, and none of his scenes were rendered usingCGI—even when the guitar shoots fire.[62]Second unitdirector and supervisingstunt coordinatorGuy Norris was in charge of over 150 stunt performers, some of whom were fromCirque du Soleil.[63]Hardy later said he had a hard time seeing Miller's vision during production, which frustrated him. He understood after seeing the finished film, however, and started his Cannes press briefing with a lengthy apology to Miller, calling the director ""brilliant"".[64]Theron and Hardy clashed on set during filming.[65][66][67]Hardy would show up late to set frequently, disrupting the shooting schedule.[68][69]Post-production[edit]Miller recruited his wife,Margaret Sixel, to edit the film, as he felt she could make it stand out from other action films.[70]Sixel had 480 hours of footage to edit, which took three months to watch.[71]The film contains about 2,700 cuts in 120 minutes, or 22.5 cuts per minute, compared toMad Max 2's 1,200 cuts in 90 minutes, or 13.33 cuts per minute.[72]According to Seale, ""something like 50 or 60 percent of the film is not running at 24 frames a second, which is the traditionalframe rate. It'll be running below 24 frames because George, if he couldn't understand what was happening in the shot, he slowed it down until you could ... Or if it was too well understood, he'd shorten it or he'd speed it up back towards 24. His manipulation of every shot in that movie is intense.""[73]The Washington Postnoted that the changing frame rate gives the film an ""almost cartoonishly jerky"" look.[74]The film contains 2,000visual effectsshots.[75]The lead effects company was Iloura, which produced more than 1,500 effects shots for the film.[76]Additional visual effects studios that worked on the film includeMethod Studios, Brave New World vfx, Stereo D, 4DMax, BlackGinger,The Third Floor, and Dr D Studios.[77][78]The effects work included altering lighting and time of day, weather effects, terrain replacement, and plate composition.[79]Sound designerMark Manginistated that he viewed the War Rig as an allegory forMoby-Dick, with Immortan Joe playing the role ofCaptain Ahab. As such, the mechanical truck sounds of the Rig were layered with whale calls to provide a more animal-like quality, and when the tank is pierced with harpoons and milk sprays out, sounds of whales breathing from their blow-holes were incorporated. For the final destruction of the War Rig, the only sounds used were slowed down bear growls to symbolise the death of the truck as a living creature.[80]Although Miller was contractually obligated to deliver a PG-13 film,[8]Warner Bros. decided to hold test screenings for two different versions: a studio cut and a Miller cut. The Miller cut tested better than the studio cut, so Warner Bros. decided to release the film with an R-rating.[81]Miller had originally planned to shoot the film in native 3D, but this idea was eventually scrapped, due to both budgetary concerns and doubts that the 3D cameras could withstand the tough desert filming conditions and extensive stunt work, and it was converted to 3D in post-production instead.[82]Music[edit]Main article:Mad Max: Fury Road (soundtrack)Themusical scoreforMad Max: Fury Roadwas written by the Dutch composerJunkie XL.[83]Prior to his involvement,Hans Zimmer,John Powell, andMarco Beltramiwere attached at separate times to score the film.[84][85]Asoundtrack albumwas released byWaterTower Musicon 12 May 2015.[86]Themes[edit]Survival and humanity[edit]Miller described the film's key theme as survival, which he said it has in common with theAmerican Westernsthat were ""such a staple for the better part of a century inAmerican cinema"",[87]while several critics wrote that the primary theme ofMad Max: Fury Roadis the attempt to retain humanity in the face of apocalyptic events.[88][89]Max begins the film as a survivor haunted by visions of deceased people and recovers his humanity by partnering with Furiosa.[90]Feminism[edit]Feminismis another theme that has received academic attention.[91]Charlize Theron as Furiosa is the dramatic centre of the film.[20]Throughout, Furiosa demonstrates the physicality of a hero committed to a rescue mission that ""sets up the start of a matriarchy as an antidote to the barbarian, warlike tribes that came before"".[92]These elements contrast this film with the male-centred stories of the previousMad Maxfilms.[93]Disability[edit]Some literary scholars have fostered the idea of disability as a theme, predominantly due to Furiosa’s prosthetic arm and her utilisation of it.[94]Immortan Joe also deals with disabilities, but is obsessed with able-bodiedness, and is the antithesis to Furiosa’s pro-disablism. The film has been praised by disability scholars for its inclusion and treatment of disabled persons.[95]Other themes[edit]Miller described the film as ""a very simple allegory, almost a western on wheels"".[96]Further themes pointed out by critics include vengeance, solidarity, home and redemption.[97]Home dominates the motivations of Max, Furiosa and the Five Wives: Max's home was destroyed, Furiosa was taken from her home and the wives are in search of a new home to raise their children.[98]The unity of these characters harnesses a concern for family, which is a common theme in Miller's films (Happy Feet,Happy Feet 2andBabe: Pig in the City).[99]Themes ofecological collapseand moraldecadenceare also present in the film.[100]Release[edit]Comic books[edit]See also:Mad Max: Fury Road (comic book)In May 2015,Vertigo Comicsbegan publishing a comic book prequellimited seriesconsisting of four issues, with each issue focusing on the backstory of one or two of the film's characters. The first issue, titledMad Max: Fury Road –Nuxand Immortan Joe #1, was released on 20 May; the second,Mad Max: Fury Road – Furiosa #1, was released on 17 June; the third,Mad Max: Fury Road – Mad Max #1, was released on 8 July; and the fourth,Mad Max: Fury Road – Mad Max #2, was released on 5 August.[101][102]A deluxe-edition hardcover collection of art inspired by the film, titledMad Max: Fury Road – Inspired Artists Deluxe Edition, was released by Vertigo on 6 May.[101]Theatrical[edit]The film had its world premiere at theTCL Chinese Theatrein Los Angeles on 7 May 2015.[103]It screened out-of-competition at the68th Cannes Film Festivalon 14 May,[104]and it was theatrically released in the United States the next day.[105]Home media[edit]Miller said theBlu-rayDisc release of the film would includeblack-and-whiteandsilentversions of the film, with the latter accompanied by the musical score, and described the black-and-white cut as the best version.[106][107]However, when details for the initial UK and US releases of the Blu-ray were announced, the alternate cuts were missing.[108][109]The film was released on both 3D and standard Blu-ray as well asDVDin the UK on 5 October 2015.[110]In the US, it was releaseddigitallyon 11 August 2015, and physically on 1 September. In addition to the stand-alone release, a box set containing all fourMad Maxfilms and a documentary about the series titledThe Madness of Maxwas released the same day.[111]Producer Doug Mitchell confirmed in December 2015 that the black-and-white version of the film existed and could potentially see a future theatrical release.[112]In January 2016, Miller announced that the black-and-white version would appear on a later DVD release,[113]and it debuted as part of theMad Max: High Octaneanthology released in October 2016, with the black-and-white version ofFury Roadcalled theBlack & Chrome Edition. TheBlack & Chrome Editionwas made without the involvement of cinematographer John Seale, but Seale said the idea was ""beautifully dramatic"" and he thought ""the new version will emphasise"" the actors' performances.[114]Home media editions ofMad Max: Fury Roadwere among the top-selling video titles in the US in 2015 and 2016.[115][116]As of 2023[update], over three million copies have been sold, for a total revenue of $56.4 million.[117]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]Mad Max: Fury Roadgrossed $154.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $226.1 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $380.4 million[9]against a production budget of $154.6–185.2 million.[8]It was the 21st-highest-grossing film of 2015.[118]Although the film made a gross profit,The Hollywood Reportercalculatedthat the net loss incurred by the film was around $20–40 million.[119]In the United States and Canada, the film was released in 3,702 theatres the same weekend asPitch Perfect 2.[120]It earned $16.77 million its opening day,[121]which included $3.7 million from Thursday night screenings at 3,000 theatres.[122][123]The film grossed $45.4 million its opening weekend, finishing in second at the box office behindPitch Perfect 2($69.2 million).[124]Critical response[edit]On thereview aggregatorwebsiteRotten Tomatoes, 97% of 439 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.60/10. The website's ""critics consensus"" reads: ""With exhilarating action and a surprising amount of narrative heft,Mad Max: Fury Roadbrings George Miller's post-apocalyptic franchise roaring vigorously back to life.""[125]Metacritic, which uses aweighted average, assigned the film a score of 90 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[126]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""B+"" on an A+ to F scale.[122]Robbie CollinofThe Daily Telegraphgave the film a full five out of five and praised its acting, screenplay, choreography, stunts, humour, and direction, describing it as a ""Krakatoaneruption of craziness"".[127]Peter BradshawofThe Guardianawarded it four out of five and wrote that it is ""extravagantly deranged, ear-splittingly cacophonous, and entirely over the top"", a ""bizarre convoy chase action-thriller in the post-apocalyptic desert"".[128]Lindsay Bahr of theAssociated Pressdescribed the film as ""radically visionary"".[129]Robert W. Butler ofThe Kansas City Stargave the film a scoring of three out of four, saying, ""A mind-boggling exercise in pure actionMad Max: Fury Roadis overwhelming, achieving the sort of visual poetry typically ascribed toBen-Hur's chariot race or one ofSam Peckinpah's blood ballets"".[130]IGNreviewer Scott Collura gave the film 9.2 out of 10, writing, ""The over-the-top stunts and eccentric characters and designs are all hugely important toFury Road, as are the troubled figures like Max himself and Furiosa, but it's the overriding sense of the film's uniqueness, its striving to be something more than just another action movie, that is most impressive.""[131]Richard Roeperof theChicago Sun-Timesgave the film four out of four and wrote thatTheronandHardyare ""one of the best action duos ever, in one of the best action movies"".[90]Similarly,Rolling Stone'sPeter Traverscalled the film ""a new action classic"", and gave particular praise to its editing, costumes, and soundtrack.[132]Mick LaSalleof theSan Francisco Chroniclewrote a mixed review, praising the cinematography and Theron's performance, but describing the film as a ""long, dull chase"".[133]The film has been praised by scholars on several fronts.Women's studiesscholars have praised the dominant role taken by Furiosa and the range of atypical female roles, including the wives and the gun-toting Vuvalini,[134]anddisability studiesscholars have commended its positive, non-stigmatising portrayals of physical and psychological disabilities.[135]Accolades[edit]Main article:List of accolades received by Mad Max: Fury RoadAt the88th Academy Awards,Mad Max: Fury Roadreceived nominations forBest Picture,Best Director,Best Cinematography, andBest Visual Effects; and wonBest Film Editing,Best Production Design,Best Costume Design,Best Makeup and Hairstyling,Best Sound MixingandBest Sound Editing.

Simmons.Having been fond of musicals during his time as a drummer, Chazelle first conceptualized the film alongsideJustin Hurwitzwhile attendingHarvard Universitytogether. After moving to Los Angeles in 2010, Chazelle penned the script but did not find a studio willing to finance the production without changes to his design. After the success of his filmWhiplash(2014), the project was picked up bySummit Entertainment.Miles TellerandEmma Watsonwere originally in talks to star, but after both dropped out, Gosling and Stone were cast. Filming took place in Los Angeles between August and September 2015, withthe film's scorecomposed by Hurwitz, who also wrote the film's songs with lyricistsBenj Pasek and Justin Pauland the dance choreography byMandy Moore.La La Landpremiered at the73rd Venice International Film Festivalon August 31, 2016, and was released theatrically in the United States on December 9, byLionsgate. The film emerged as a major commercial success, grossing $472 million worldwide on a budget of $30 million, and received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for Chazelle's direction and screenplay, the performances of Gosling and Stone, the score, musical numbers, cinematography, visual style, costumes and production design. It went on to receivenumerous accolades, including winning a record seven awards at the74th Golden Globe Awardsand received eleven nominations at the70th British Academy Film Awards, winning five, includingBest Film. The film also received a record-tying fourteen nominations at the89th Academy Awards, winning in six categories includingBest DirectorandBest Actress(Stone). In the former category, Chazelle became theyoungest winnerat age 32. It has since been regarded as one of thebest filmsof the 2010s and the 21st century, and as one of the best musical and romantic films of all time.[a]As of February 2023[update], a stage musical adaptation is in the works.[14]Plot[edit]While stuck in Los Angeles traffic, Sebastian ""Seb"" Wilder has a moment ofroad ragedirected at aspiring actress Mia Dolan. After a hard day at work, Mia's next audition goes awry because the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in theHollywood Hills, promising her that someone in the crowd could jump-start her career. After her car is towed, she walks home in disappointment.During a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation despite the owner's warning to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia hears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and observes Seb being fired for his disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him as he storms out, but he brushes by her. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. Mia requests that Seb play ""I Ran"" for her. After the gig, they walk to their cars and – despite an obvious chemistry – lament wasting a lovely night on each other.Seb arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around theWarner Bros. backlot, where she works as abarista, while expressing her passion for acting. He takes her to ajazz club, describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club. Seb invites Mia to a screening ofRebel Without a Causeand she accepts, forgetting a date with her boyfriend. Bored with the latter date, she rushes to the theater and finds Seb as the film begins. When the screening is interrupted by a projector malfunction, Seb and Mia spend the rest of the evening together with a romantic visit to theGriffith Observatory.After more failed auditions, Mia decides, with Seb's encouragement, to write aone-woman play. Seb begins to perform regularly at a jazz club, and the two of them eventually move in together. A former bandmate of Seb invites him to be the keyboardist in a new jazz fusion band, which will give him a steady income. Although dismayed by the band's pop style, Seb signs on after hearing Mia trying to convince her mother that he is working on his career. The band finds success, but Mia knows their music is not the type of music Seb wants to perform.During the band's first tour, Seb and Mia argue: she accuses him of abandoning his dreams, while he claims that she liked him more when he was unsuccessful because it made her feel better about herself. Two weeks later, Seb misses Mia's play because of a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play fails, very few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, Mia returns to her hometown ofBoulder City, Nevada.Seb receives a phone call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to audition for an upcoming film. Knowing that this could be her big break, he drives in a hurry to Boulder City and finds her house since he remembered that she lived across the street from the library, where she fell in love with acting. Seb persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees to go.During the audition the next day, Mia is asked to tell a story. In response, she sings about how her aunt, a one-time stage actress who eventually died fromalcoholism, inspired her to chase her dreams. Confident the audition was a success, Seb encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two then recognize that they will always love each other despite what may come for their relationship.Five years later, Mia is living a happy life as a successful actress and married to a different man, with whom she has a daughter. That night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has opened his own jazz club. Seb notices Mia in the crowd and begins to play their love theme on the piano. The two imagine what their happy life together would have been had their relationship thrived along with their careers, then acknowledge each other with a silent exchange of smiles and go their separate ways.Cast[edit]Ryan Goslingas Sebastian ""Seb"" Wilder, a musician who wants to own his own jazz clubEmma Stoneas Amelia ""Mia"" Dolan, an actress whose aunt inspired her to follow her dreamsJohn Legendas Keith, Seb's friend and musician who invites him to join his bandJ.

The two explored the concept in their senior thesis through a low-budget musical about a Boston jazz musician,Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench.[18][19]Chazelle was moved by the tradition of 1920s ""city symphony"" films, such asManhatta(1921) andMan with a Movie Camera(1929), that paid tribute to cities.[20]After graduating, both moved to Los Angeles in 2010 and continued writing the script, but made a few modifications, such as altering the location to Los Angeles instead of Boston.[18]Rather than trying to match L.A. to the charms of Paris or San Francisco, he focused on the qualities that make the city distinctive: the traffic, the sprawl, and the skylines.[20]The style and tone of the film were inspired byJacques Demy'sThe Umbrellas of CherbourgandThe Young Girls of Rochefort, especially the latter, which was more dance and jazz-oriented.[21]The film also makes visual allusions to Hollywood classics such asBroadway Melody of 1940,Singin' in the Rain,The Band Wagon, andAn American in Paris.[22]AboutAn American in Paris,Chazelle commented: ""That's a movie that we just pillaged.  It's an awesome example of how daring some of those old musicals really were.""[23]It shares some character development and themes with Chazelle's previous musical work,Whiplash;Chazelle said:""They're both about the struggle of being an artist and reconciling your dreams with the need to be human.La La Landis just much less angry about it.""[24]He said that both films reflect his own experiences as a filmmaker working his way up the Hollywood ladder.[17]La La Landin particular is inspired by his experience of moving from the East Coast with preconceived notions of what L.A. would be like, ""that it was all just strip malls and freeways"".[20]Chazelle was unable to produce the film for years as no studio was willing to finance an original contemporary musical with no familiar songs. It is also a jazz musical, whichThe Hollywood Reportercalled an ""extinct genre"". He believed that since he and Hurwitz were unknown at that time, it might have made financiers dubious about the project's potential.[25][18]Gosling's character Sebastian holds a view of the jazz of the past being superior. According to an article by Anthony Carew, Chazelle wrote this character trait as a reflection of ""[his] own relationship with the past and with jazz, too"".[26]Chazelle found producers through friends who introduced him toFred BergerandJordan Horowitz. With the two producers on board, the script went toFocus Featuresat a budget of around $1 million. The studio demanded alterations: the male lead was asked to be changed from a jazz pianist to a rock musician, the complicated opening number had to be altered, and the story's bittersweet ending needed to be dropped. Chazelle scrapped the project and moved on.[18]Chazelle later wroteWhiplash, which was an easier concept to sell and a less risky investment.[27]AfterWhiplashwas well received by critics upon its premiere at the2014 Sundance Film Festivalin January, Chazelle continued his efforts to bringLa La Landto the big screen.[18]A year later, whenWhiplashearned five Oscar nominations at the87th Academy Awards, includingBest Picture, and grossed nearly $50 million worldwide off a $3.3 million production budget, Chazelle and his project began to attract attention from studios.[25]Five years after Chazelle wrote the script,[28]Summit Entertainmentand Black Label Media, along with producerMarc Platt, agreed to invest inLa La Landand distribute it. They had been impressed by the critical and commercial success ofWhiplash.[17]Lionsgate's Patrick Wachsberger, who previously had worked on theStep Upfranchise, pushed Chazelle to increase the film's budget since he felt high-quality musicals could not be made cheaply.[29]Casting[edit]Miles TellerandEmma Watsonwere originally slated to star in the leading roles. Watson dropped out to honor her commitments toDisney'slive-actionBeauty and the Beastremake(2017), while Teller exited via long contract negotiations.[16]Coincidentally, Gosling turned down theBeastrole inBeauty and the Beastin favor ofLa La Land.[30]Chazelle subsequently decided to make his characters somewhat older, with experience in struggling to make their dreams, rather than younger newcomers just arriving in Los Angeles.[18]Emma Stone plays Mia, an aspiring actress in Los Angeles.[25]Stone has loved musicals since she sawLes Misérableswhen she was eight years old. She said ""bursting into song has always been a real dream of mine"", and her favorite film is the 1931Charlie Chaplinromantic comedyCity Lights.[25][15]She studiedpom dancingas a child, with a year of ballet.[25]She moved to Hollywood with her mother at age fifteen to pursue a career, and struggled constantly to get an audition during her first year. When she did, she often was turned away after singing or saying just one line.[31]Stone drew from her own experiences for her character of Mia, and some were added into the film.[24]Ryan Goslinglearned tap dancing and piano for his role.She met Chazelle in 2014 while she was making her Broadway debut inCabaret.Chazelle and Hurwitz saw her perform on a night when the actress had a cold.[25][32]She met with Chazelle at Brooklyn Diner inNew York City, where the director outlined his vision for the planned film.[33]Stone gained confidence from performing inCabaretto handle the demands of the film.[33]In preparation for her role, Stone watched some of the musical movies that inspired Chazelle, includingThe Umbrellas of CherbourgandFred Astaire and Ginger Rogerscollaborations.[28]Stone accepted the offer because Chazelle was so passionate about the project.[33]Ryan Gosling plays Sebastian, a jazz pianist.[25]Like Stone, Gosling drew from his own experiences as an aspiring artist. One incident was used for Mia. Gosling was performing a crying scene in an audition and the casting director took a phone call during it, talking about her lunch plans while he was emoting.[25][31][34]Chazelle met with Gosling when he was about to begin filming forThe Big Short.[18]Chazelle cast Gosling and Stone immediately after Summit bought the film.[17]He stated that the duo ""feel like the closest thing that we have right now to an old Hollywood couple"" as akin toSpencer TracyandKatharine Hepburn,Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers,Humphrey BogartandLauren Bacall, andMyrna LoyandWilliam Powell.[24]The film marked the third collaboration between Gosling and Stone, followingCrazy, Stupid, Love(2011) andGangster Squad(2013).[35]Chazelle asked the two about their audition disasters when they were both trying to make it.[31]Both learned to sing and dance for the film's six original tunes.[18]The rest of the cast –J. K. Simmons,Sonoya Mizuno,Jessica Rothe,Callie Hernandez,Finn Wittrock,Rosemarie DeWitt,John Legend,Jason Fuchs,Meagen Fay– were announced between July and August 2015.[36][37][38][39][40][41]The film was choreographed byMandy Moore. Rehearsals took place at a production office inAtwater Village, Los Angelesover the span of three to four months, beginning in May 2015. Gosling practiced piano in one room, Stone worked with Moore in another, and costume designerMary Zophreshad her own corner of the complex.[25][18]Gosling, with no previous experience, had to learn how to play the piano; no hand models were used.[42]Moore emphasized working on emotion rather than technique, which Stone said was key when they filmed the ""A Lovely Night"" scene (searching for the parked car).[25]To help his cast and crew get their creative mode flowing, Chazelle held screenings on the soundstages every Friday night of classical films that had inspired him for the film, includingThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg,Singin' in the Rain,Top Hat, andBoogie Nights.[18]Filming[edit]From the beginning, Chazelle wanted the film's musical numbers to be filmed ""head to toe"" and performed in a single take, like those of the 1930s works of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.[33]He also wanted the film to emulate the widescreen,CinemaScopelook of 1950s musicals such asIt's Always Fair Weather. Consequently, the movie was shot on celluloid 4-perf Super 35mm film (not digitally) with Panavision anamorphic lenses in CinemaScope's 2.55:1 aspect ratio, but not in true CinemaScope as that technology is no longer available.[43][44][45][46]Chazelle wanted Los Angeles to be the primary setting for his film, commenting that ""there is something very poetic about the city I think, about a city that is built by people with these unrealistic dreams and people who kind of just put it all on the line for that.""[15]Principal photography on the film officially began in the city on August 10, 2015,[47]and filming took place in more than 60 locations both in and near Los Angeles, including theAngels Flighttrolley in downtown, houses in the Hollywood Hills, theColorado Street Bridge, theRialto TheatreinSouth Pasadena, theWarner Bros. studio lot, theGrand Central Market,Hermosa Beach'sLighthouse Café,Griffith Observatory,Griffith Park,Chateau Marmont, theWatts Towers, andLong Beach,[48]with many scenes shot in one take. It took 40 days to complete shooting, finishing in mid-September 2015.[18][49][50]The opening pre-credits sequence was the first to be shot,[18]and was filmed on a closed-off portion of two carpool direct connector ramps of theJudge Harry Pregerson Interchange, connecting the I-105 Carpool Lane to the I-110 Express Lanes, leading toDowntown Los Angeles. It was filmed in a span of two days, and required more than 100 dancers.[17][51]For this particular scene, Chazelle wanted to give a sense of how vast the city is.[20]The scene was originally planned for a stretch of ground-level highway, until Chazelle decided to shoot it in the 105–110 interchange, which arcs 100 feet (30 m) in the air. Production designer David Wasco said, ""I thought somebody was going to fall off and get killed."" Not every portion of the highway was blocked.[18]Chazelle compared the scene to theyellow brick roadleading to theEmerald CityinThe Wizard of Oz(1939).[18]TheAngels Flight(pictured), which was shut down for about four years, including at the time of the filming, was re-opened for a single day exclusively for the film to shoot a scene.Chazelle scouted for ""old L.A."" locations that were in ruins, or were perhaps razed. One such example was the use of the Angels Flight trolley, built in 1901. Thefunicularhad been closed in 2013 after aderailment. Attempts were made to repair and re-open the railway, but to no avail. However, the production team was able to secure permission to use it for a day. Chazelle and his crew then arranged to have it run for shooting (it was re-opened to the public in 2017).[20]Mia works at a coffee shop on theWarner Bros. studio lot; Chazelle considered studio lots to be ""monuments"" of Hollywood. Production designer Wasco created numerous fake old film posters. Chazelle occasionally created names for them, deciding to use the title of his first feature,Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench(2009) for one poster, which reimagines it as a 1930s musical.[20]External videosThe full ""A Lovely Night"" sceneviaYouTubeThe now-iconic[52][53][54]six-minute-long ""A Lovely Night"" scene (searching for the parked car) had to be completed during the brief ""magic hour"" moment at sunset. It took eight takes and two days to shoot it.[25]When Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone finally nailed it, ""everybody just exploded,"" Stone said.[33]Since Gosling and Stone were not primarily dancers, the two made a number of mistakes, especially during long uninterrupted single-take musical numbers. However, Chazelle was very sympathetic towards them, understanding their lack of experience and not minding their errors.[28]While shooting Sebastian and Mia's first dance together, Stone stumbled over the back of a bench, but picked right up and kept on going with the scene.[28]In 2024, Gosling reflected on the filming of this scene, wishing he could re-film it to correct the positioning of his hand in the famous still frame from the sequence that was used throughout the film's marketing, saying that ""It just killed the energy that way ... It was all leading to what? A lazy ... I call it La La Hand.""[53]Chazelle said that the romantic dinner that Sebastian prepared for Mia was ""one of the scenes that I think I wrote and rewrote and rewrote more than any other in the script"".[55]Gosling and Stone also helped create the dialogue of the scene to get it to be one of the more realistic scenes in a film filled with fantasy and fantastical elements.[55]Chazelle spent nearly a year editing the film with editorTom Cross, as the two were primarily concerned with getting the tone right.[18]Soundtrack[edit]Main article:La La Land (soundtrack)The songs and score forLa La Landwere composed and orchestrated by Justin Hurwitz, Chazelle's Harvard University classmate, who also worked on his two prior films.[25]The lyrics were written byPasek and Paul,[33]except for ""Start a Fire"", which was written by John Legend, Hurwitz,Marius de Vriesand Angelique Cinelu.[56]A soundtrack album was released on December 9, 2016, byInterscope Records, featuring selections from Hurwitz's score and songs performed by the cast.[56]The film's opening number, ""Another Day of Sun"", shot as a singletracking shoton an L.A. freeway, received praise for its choreography. The songs ""City of Stars"" and ""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)"" received numerous awards.Release[edit]La La Landhad its world premiere as theVenice Film Festival's opening night film on August 31, 2016.[57][58]The film also screened at theTelluride Film Festival,[59]theToronto International Film Festival, beginning September 12, 2016,[60]theBFI London Film Festival,[61]theMiddleburg Film Festivalin late October 2016, theVirginia Film Festival, held at the University of Virginia on November 6, 2016, and theAFI Feston November 15, 2016.[62]La La Landwas originally set for a July 15, 2016, release;[63]however, in March 2016, it was announced the film would be given a limited release starting December 2, 2016, before expanding on December 16, 2016.[64]Chazelle stated that the change was because he felt that the release date was not right for the context of the film, and because he wanted to have a slow rollout beginning with the early fall film festivals.[24]The limited release was later moved back a week to December 9, 2016, with the wide release still being planned for December 16, 2016.[65]Lionsgate opened the film in five locations on December 9, 2016, and expanded it to about 200 theaters on December 16, 2016, before going nationwide on December 25, 2016. The film went fully wide on January 6, 2017,[50]with a release into selectIMAXtheaters a week later.[66]La La Landwas released in the United Kingdom on January 12, 2017.[67]The film was released in theNetherlandson December 22, 2016, and inAustraliaon December 26, with the rest of the territories planned for a release from mid-January 2017.[68]Home media[edit]Lionsgate releasedLa La LandonDigital HDon April 11, 2017, andBlu-ray,Ultra HD Blu-rayandDVDon April 25, 2017.[69]Reception[edit]Box office[edit]La La Landgrossed $151.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $320.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $472 million, against a production budget of $30 million.[70]Deadline Hollywoodcalculated the net profit of the film to be $68.25 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues for the film, making it one of the top 20 most profitable releases of 2016.[71]This isRyan Gosling's second highest-grossing film, as it was displaced byBarbiein 2023.[72]La La Landbegan its theatrical release with a limited release in five theaters in Los Angeles and New York City on December 9.

The website's critical consensus reads, ""La La Landbreathes new life into a bygone genre with thrillingly assured direction, powerful performances, and an irresistible excess of heart.""[87]OnMetacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 94 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"".[88]It was the third- and sixth-highest scoring film released in 2016 on each respective site.[89][90]Audiences polled byCinemaScoregave the film an average grade of ""A−"" on an A+ to F scale,[91]whilePostTrakreported audiences gave an 81% overall positive score and a 93% ""definite recommend"".[79]Peter TraversofRolling StonegaveLa La Landfour stars out of four, describing it as ""a hot miracle"" and complimenting its musical numbers, particularly the opening scene. He went on to name it his favorite movie of the year.[92]Michael Phillipsof theChicago Tribunesimilarly lauded the opening sequence, in addition to highlighting Stone's performance, stating ""she's reason enough to seeLa La Land."" Despite being less enthusiastic about Gosling's dancing and the film's middle section, Phillips nevertheless gave the film four out of four stars, declaring it ""the year's most seriously pleasurable entertainment"".[93]A.O. ScottofThe New York Timespraised the film, stating that it ""succeeds both as a fizzy fantasy and a hard-headed fable, a romantic comedy and a showbiz melodrama, a work of sublime artifice and touching authenticity"".[94]Peter BradshawofThe Guardianawarded the film five out of five stars, describing it as ""a sun-drenched musical masterpiece.""[95]Tom Charity ofSight & Soundstated, ""Chazelle has crafted that rare thing, a genuinely romantic comedy, and as well, a rhapsody in blue, red, yellow and green.""[96]Writing forThe Boston Globe,Ty Burrsummarized the effectiveness of the film to relate to audiences stating: ""...the movie traffics in the bittersweet happiness of treasuring things that are vanishing, like the unrealized future imagined in the climactic dance number, or those inky, star-filled dance floors that go on forever in old movies, or Hollywood musicals themselves. Or jazz: Sebastian has an early moment at a nightclub where he passionately sticks up for the music he loves. 'It's dying on the vine,' he says. 'And the world says 'Let it die. It had its time.' Well, not on my watch.' In that scene, he speaks for the director. By the end ofLa La Land, he's speaking for all of us.""[97]FilmmakersJonathan Demme,Jay Duplass,Paul Feig,Chad Hartigan,Chris Kelly,Daniel Kwan,Rebecca Miller,Reed Morano,Christopher Nolan,James PonsoldtandNanfu Wangalso praised the film.[98][99]La La Land's competition for awards and critical attention with theAfrican-AmericanfilmMoonlightshortly after the election ofDonald Trumpsharpened the attention on questions of racial sensitivity and unexaminedwhite privilegein the characters of film. While accolades from audiences and critics grew, the film received backlash for what some considered a disproportional amount of praise.[100]Saturday Night Livelampooned the fervor over the film with a sketch about a man arrested for thinking it was ""decent... but also boring.""[101]The film was criticized by some for its treatment of race and jazz. Kelly Lawler ofUSA Todaynoted that Gosling's character has been referred to as a ""white savior"" by some critics, for ""his quest (and eventual success) to save the traditionallyblack musical genrefrom extinction, seemingly the only person who can accomplish such a goal.""[102]The sentiment was also expressed by Ruby Lott-Lavigna ofWired,[103]Anna Silman ofNew York,[104]and Ira Madison III ofMTV News.[105]Rex Reedof theNew York Observeralso took aim at the film's intention to emulate the MGM musical classics, writing that ""the old-fashioned screenplay, by the ambitious writer-director Damien Chazelle, reeks of mothballs"", and that ""the movie sags badly in the middle, like a worn-out mattress that needs new springs"".[106]TheSouth China Morning Postremarked that aside from its racial treatment of jazz, much of the public criticism was towards the film being ""a little dull"", the two leads' singing and dancing being considered unexceptional, and the lack of nuance in Stone's character, with Gosling's occasionally seen as insufferable.[101]Legacy[edit]Since its release,La La Landcontinues to receive acclaim. It is regarded as a modern classic and one of the best films of all time due to its captivating performances, attention to detail, and its assent to previous movie musicals such asSingin' in the Rain.[107]In 2019,CBC Radioincluded it on its list of ""the greatest romantic movies of all time."" In 2021, Helena Trauger ofThe Beaconcalled it the best film of the 2010s, stating that it is ""one of the most creative and well-executed films that every person should attempt to watch at least once."" In 2022,Time Outranked it number 79 on its list of the ""100 Best Films of the 21st Century,"" writing that it ""has a signature all of its own, stopping traffic in the first glorious sequence.""[108]MovieWebranked the film number 2 on its list of the ""Best Movie Musicals of the 21st Century So Far,"" in 2022 as well. In 2023, it ranked it number 3 on its list of the ""15 Greatest Movies About Jazz"" and number 1 on its list of the ""Best Modern Movies Shot on Film.""[109]It also ranked number 2 onTeen Vogue's list of ""The 45 Best Dance Movies of All Time.""[110]The film ranked number 15 onCollider's list of the ""30 Best Musicals of All Time,"" with Jeremy Urquhart writing, ""It works as a modern update/homage to classic Hollywood musicals that were popular in the 1950s without ever feeling derivative or mocking, and Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in the lead roles both give great performances that are up there with the best of their respective careers.""It also ranked number 8 onParade's list of the ""67 Best Movie Musicals of All Time,"" with Samuel R. Murrian writing that the film is ""many things, thusly its own creation: deftly blending a modern showbiz melodrama, a giddy throwback, a striking love story.""Screen Rantalso ranked it at number 10 on its list ""The 35 Best Musicals of All Time"" and number 1 on its list of ""The 12 Best Movie Musicals of the 21st Century,"" whileIndieWireranked it at number 12 on its list of ""The 60 Best Movie Musicals of All Time."" Wilson Chapman, curation editor for IndieWire, wrote thatLa La Land's story has just the right harmony of romance and melancholy, and that pieces such as ""Another Day of Sun"" and ""A Lovely Night"" are catchy and rememberable. He remarked that the Oscar-winning ""City of Stars,"" as well as others of Hurwitz's scores, are ""some of the finest written for any movie this century.""[b]In 2024,Looperranked it number 11 on its list of the ""51 Best PG-13 Movies of All Time,"" calling the film ""a deeply affecting feature thanks to a pair of great performances from Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Any movie likeLa La Landthat gets toes tapping and tears flowing with such grace is worth remembering.""[112]In March 2025,The Washington Postranked the film at number 13 on its list of ""The 25 best movie musicals of the 21st century,"" with Ty Burr writing ""The results are even closer to the touchstone of Jacques Demy’s beloved 1964Umbrellas of Cherbourgthan the earlier film [Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench]: love lost, found and lost again amid an evocation of a city’s hidden soul.""[113]In June 2025, filmmakerMax Hechtmanand actorsSimu LiuandMolly Ringwaldall cited the film as among their favorites of the 21st century.[114][115]Cultural impact[edit]Many elements of the film, including the visual style, use of colors, staging of the musical numbers and costume designs have been referenced numerous times inpopular culturesince its release. These include the entire opening segment of the74th Golden Globe Awards, featuring parodies of ""Another Day of Sun,"" ""City of Stars"" and the planetarium sequence with hostJimmy Fallon,Nicole Kidman,Amy Adams,Sarah Paulson,Courtney B. Vance,Sterling K. Brown,Evan Rachel Wood,Rami Malek, andKit Haringtonparticipating, an independently produced short film parody set inNew York CitytitledNY NY Land, a skit onseason 42ofSaturday Night Livewhere hostAziz Ansariplays a character who is interrogated over calling the film ""overrated"" because of its Oscar nominations, and a television commercial for the prescriptionJardiance.[116][117][118][119]The 2018 single ""Love Scenario"" byIKondrew heavy inspiration from the film's epilogue sequence.[120]The 2021Disneyanimated short film,Us Again, was also said to have been influenced by the film.[121][122]In the closing ofThe Simpsonsepisode ""Haw-Haw Land"" it is stated that the episode was supposed to be a parody ofMoonlightrather thanLa La Land(itself parodying the mistake at the89th Academy Awards.[123])Accolades[edit]Main article:List of accolades received by La La LandHurwitz, Chazelle, and Stone at theMill Valley Film Festivalin October 2016Emma Stone won theVolpi Cup for Best Actressat the Venice Film Festival.La La Landreceived 11 nominations at the70th British Academy Film Awards, more than any other film of 2016.[124]The film won in the categories ofBest Film,Best Director,Best Actress in a Leading Role(for Stone),Best Cinematography, andBest Film Music.[125]At the74th Golden Globe Awards,La La Landreceived a leading seven nominations.[126]The film won in all seven categories for which it was nominated, setting a record for the most Golden Globes won by a single film, namelyBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy,Best Director,Best Actor – Comedy or Musical(for Gosling),Best Actress – Comedy or Musical(for Stone),Best Screenplay,Best Original Score, andBest Original Song(""City of Stars"") breaking the recordOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nestset for the most wins.[127]At the89th Academy Awards,La La Landreceived a leading six awards, namelyBest Director,Best Actress(for Stone),Best Cinematography,Best Original Score,Best Original Song(""City of Stars""), andBest Production Design.[128]The film received a total of 14 nominations, tying the record for most nominations by a single film withAll About Eve(1950) andTitanic(1997).[129]Its other nominations wereBest Picture,Best Actor(for Gosling),Best Original Screenplay,Best Film Editing,Best Costume Design, a second nomination forBest Original Song(""Audition (The Fools Who Dream)""),Best Sound Editing, andBest Sound Mixing.[130]Best Picture Oscar gaffe[edit]See also:89th Academy Awards § Best Picture announcement errorDuring the Oscars ceremony, presenterFaye Dunawayincorrectly announced thatLa La Landhad won Best Picture, reading from the cardWarren Beattyopened, which was actually a duplicate of the Best Actress card for Emma Stone.[131]After the cast and crew ofLa La Landtook the stage, it took the show's producers more than two minutes (during which nearly three speeches were made) to fix the mistake. The actual winner wasMoonlight.[132]German television prank[edit]In March 2017,La La Landwas at the center of aprankinvolvingGoldene Kamera, an annual German film and television award. German comediansJoko WinterscheidtandKlaas Heufer-Umlaufarranged for a Ryan Goslingimpersonatorto be awarded the ""Best International Film"" prize forLa La Land.[133][134][135]Following the event, a speaker for television broadcasterZDFasked for the trophy to be given back, stating thatLa La Landhad won the prize and that the trophy would be given to the real Ryan Gosling.[136]The incident, which became known as ""GoslingGate"", sparked criticism of the event's concept. Media critics argued that the ""Best International Film"" award had only been created in an effort to get Ryan Gosling on the show, with no regards for the film's quality. The incident played a major role in the cancellation of the Goldene Kamera in 2019.[137][138]In 2018, Winterscheidt and Heufer-Umlauf were awarded theGrimme Awardfor theirmedia criticism.[139]Stage adaptations[edit]Broadway musical[edit]On February 7, 2023, it was announced that the film would be adapted into a Broadway musical by Platt and Lionsgate.
